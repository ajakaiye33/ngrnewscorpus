          "title": "Soludo sworn in as Anambra governor, retains Obiano\u2019s SSG",
          "text": "There was a mild drama at the Government House, Awka, on Thursday, as Prof Chukwuma Soludo took his oath of office as the sixth governor of Anambra State.\n\nThe fight between the wife of the immediate past governor, Ebelechukwu Obiano, and the wife of the former leader of Biafra, Chief Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, Bianca, took the shine off the inauguration of the new governor, which started around 9.45am.\n\nIt was a low-key ceremony as only a few guests, including a former governor of the state, Peter Obi; an economist, Prof Pat Utomi; and a former Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Victor Umeh, were among the dignitaries at the event.\n\nHowever, the former deputy governor of the state, Prof Nkem Okeke, who had earlier defected to the All Progressives Congress, was not at the ceremony.\n\nJust as Soludo was about to take his oath of office, the fracas between Ebelechukwu and Bianca disrupted the proceedings for a few minutes before normalcy was finally returned.\n\nThe commotion started when Ebelechukwu engaged in a fight with Bianca.\n\nThe former governor\u2019s wife, who arrived at the venue late, approached Bianca where she was seated and was muttering some words, which apparently angered the latter.\n\nGuests, who sat close to Bianca, said Ebelechukwu uttered some words in Igbo language, which roughly translated to, \u201cSo Bianca, you are here, I thought you said our government would fail and that we won\u2019t serve eight years. Now, we have served eight years. You also said you won\u2019t attend any APGA event again; so, why are you here?\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that Ebelechukwu repeatedly muttered the words as she approached Bianca, who was seated on the front row with the former governor, Willie Obiano, an action, which angered the ex-beauty queen, who landed a slap on the face of the former governor\u2019s wife.\n\nThe immediate past first lady of the state then grabbed Bianca\u2019s hair and pulled it, before security operatives separated both women.\n\nThe commotion that followed caused a momentary disruption of the event, after which Ebelechukwu was whisked away from the venue by security operatives, while her husband, Willie, left immediately after Soludo was sworn in.\n\nEarlier, Ebelechukwu had been stopped at the gate, when her convoy attempted to use the main gate.\n\nShe came late for the event, while her husband arrived much earlier and had already inspected the guard of honour.\n\nA barricade was put on the expressway leading into the Government House, while Ebelechukwu was asked by security men to drive down to a far away junction.\n\nWhile the former governor drove out of the venue in a convoy, his wife had to trek out.\n\nAs soon as the event restarted, Soludo took the oath of office and effectively became the governor of the state.\n\nIn an apology letter signed by his media aide, Joe Anatune, the governor said the breach of protocol was caused by improper communication, which arose from a personal issue between Ebelechukwu and Bianca.\n\nThe letter read in part, \u201cGovernor Chukwuma Soludo hereby apologises to all Anambra people, friends and guests, who attended his inauguration this morning as the Anambra State governor, for the breach of protocol.\n\n\u201cThe breach was caused by improper communication, which itself arose from a personal issue between the two parties involved in the breach.\n\n\u201cSteps are being taken to resolve the misunderstanding and restore the parties to their previous relationship.\u201d\n\nIn his inaugural address, the governor enumerated the challenges facing the state such as touting, illegal collection of taxes and levies and insecurity.\n\nThe governor, while promising to flush out the touts, announced a one month tax holiday for residents of the state.\n\nHe said he would sign an Executive Order to ban all illegal revenue collectors in the state.\n\nOn the Indigenous People of Biafra/Eastern Security Network, Soludo promised to dialogue in resolving the group\u2019s agitation, saying, \u201cThere is nothing that dialogue cannot solve.\u201d\n\nHe promised to transform Anambra and make it a liveable place for everybody.\n\nSoludo said, \u201cWe will seek active collaboration and cooperation with the Federal Government, our neighbouring and other states as well as the international community to provide our state truly people-centred governance. We will consolidate the progress made under our predecessors to continue Anambra\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\n\u201cLet me once again put on record our debt of gratitude to the federal institutions \u2013 the judiciary, the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies \u2013 for insisting on a transparent and credible electoral system. Eternal gratitude goes to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Presidency for remaining democrats.\n\n\u201cIn particular, I thank my wife, Nonye Frances Soludo, and children, Ozonna, Ifeatu, Chinua, Ekene, Oduko and Zikora, for their love and sacrifices. Despite your deep reservations, you still allowed and supported me to step out in the service of our people.\n\n\u201cToday, I stand up for the millions of Ndi Anambra for whom this mandate means everything. The hopes and expectations rise up to the heavens. Understandably, all of us wish that I could perform miracles by waving my hands and all our problems will be solved. I hear you. I feel your pulse.\n\n\u201cFor your sake, I keep awake at night, sometimes having palpitations about not letting you down. Well, since God is the miracle worker, I will look up to Him in prayer and faith as we all start the work ahead of us. I see and feel all the humongous challenges.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he finished his speech, Soludo went straight into his office and began work.\n\nObi said there was great expectation from the people and noted that Soludo could not afford to disappoint them.\n\nGov makes first appointments\n\nMeanwhile, Soludo has announced the appointment of Prof Solo Chukwulobelu as the Secretary to the State Government; Dr Chukwudi Okoli as the Accountant-General; and Mr Chinedu Nwoye as the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor/State Chief of Protocol.\n\nAccording to the Anambra Broadcasting Service News, the appointment takes immediate effect.\n\nChukwulobelu, who served in the same capacity in the last administration, was retained by Soludo.\n\nSoludo had earlier in his inaugural address said, \u201cToday is my first day at work. I just reported for duty and will work for at least eight hours. We had more than a month since the election to celebrate our historic victory. Now is the time to work, and there is no minute or kobo to waste in fanfare.\n\n\u201cIn a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of the administration and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra State Security Council, followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries, a meeting on Okpoko, and with my strategy, execution and evaluation team.\n\n\u201cWithin the next one week, the list of commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "APC in race to hold March 26 convention, battles injunction",
          "text": "At least six politicians seeking to emerge as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress on March 26, 2022, have purchased the form sold for N20m each.\n\nThis implied that the APC had generated N120m from the sale of chairmanship form alone as of Thursday night.\n\nThose who have purchased the form, include the lawmaker representing the Niger-East Senatorial District, Sani Musa; a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Al-Makura; and the lawmaker representing the Nasarawa-West Senatorial District, Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nOthers are a former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, Turaki Salihu Mustapha; former governor Abdul\u2019Aziz Yari of Zamfara State; and the Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume.\n\nAlthough the party had zoned its chairmanship seat to the North-Central, Yari decided to take the plunge. It could not be confirmed if former governor Ali Modu Sheriff of Borno State had purchased his form as his telephone lines were switched off on Thursday evening.\n\nA former Federal Capital Territory Chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria, Sunny Moniedafe, also picked the N10m form for the deputy national chairman ditto for Nworgu Boms. The party is expected to stop the sale of forms today (Friday).\n\nThe aspirants, on Thursday, continued to intensify their campaigns ahead of next Saturday\u2019s convention.\n\nAl-Makura said if he becomes the national chairman of the APC, he would ensure that members of the National Assembly get another term in the federal parliament.\n\nThe senator said this in Abuja, on Thursday, at a consultative meeting with the APC caucus in the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile fielding questions from members of the House, Al-Makura noted that the legislature at the federal, state and local government levels should be occupied by experienced lawmakers.\n\nThe ex-governor, however, did not state if the lawmakers would be granted automatic tickets.\n\nResponding specifically to a question on lawmakers getting return tickets, Al-Makura said, \u201cWe will be stagnating our democracy if we promote the entrance of too many people that will come to learn how to legislate. What we are trying to look for is how we can build our democracy to endure. So, for me, I am compelled to encourage through whatever means to ensure that members, who are currently in the legislature, are encouraged to come back.\n\n\u201cThis will not be by fiat. I cannot say outright because I cannot give what I don\u2019t have. But I will work through the states \u2013 the legislature there \u2013 and other stakeholders to ensure that most of the people who are in the parliament now return, so that our democracy will grow.\u201d\n\nAccording to Al-Makura, any government that wants to ensure development and progress, especially in a democracy, cannot do without the legislature.\n\n\u201cSo, being a member of the legislature; if by the special grace of God I am the chairman of this party, the legislature, both the Senate, House of Representatives, as well as the (state) Houses of Assembly and the councillors are all members of one constituency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ex-governor also dismissed the crises bedevilling the APC, noting that he would discourage litigation under his leadership of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to say that at this point in time, we have a lot of challenges that the party is facing; a lot of crises here and there. For me, it is normal. You cannot have a party with over 14 million people and expect it to be like an empty room,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase; and the Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, hailed the chairmanship aspirant for his achievements as Nasarawa State governor and his efforts in the APC.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the first time that those aspiring are coming to us. It means then that democracy is getting deepened and we appreciate your support all through. Ours is to pray for you. We wish you well and we shall do everything possible to fall in line, to canvas for you so that we will have a viable party,\u201d Wase stated.\n\nMeanwhile, barely nine days to the convention, the party has yet to vacate a court injunction barring it from holding the event.\n\nWhen the matter came up for hearing at the Kubwa Division of the FCT High Court on Thursday, Justice Bello Kawu adjourned till today (Friday) after the new counsel for the APC, Shuaibu Aruwan (SAN), informed the court that the defendants had resolved the issue of representation.\n\nBut Mike Enahoro Eba, counsel for the claimant, Salisu Umoru, objected to the fixing of the matter for the next day, contending that the rules allowed seven days to respond, adding that the APC just introduced a new counsel.\n\nHowever, Aruwan urged the court to disregard the application for adjournment, saying the business of the day was hearing of pending applications.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the court had last November granted Umoru\u2019s application for an \u201cinterlocutory injunction restraining the APC and the Chairman, Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, their allies, agents, representatives, associates or whoever is acting for them or through them from conducting its national convention.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re now at finishing line of preparations \u2013 Buni\n\nIn a related development, Buni on Thursday in Abuja said the party was at the finishing line of its preparations for the March 26 national convention.\n\nThis is as he thanked his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Bello, for his efforts while he was away.\n\nBuni\u2019s comments came after his return from a medical trip to Dubai and meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), in London over the leadership crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe leaders, who met at the Yobe State Governors\u2019 Lodge in Asokoro, were flanked by members of the caretaker committee except for the National Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nBuni stated, \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our national convention, which is at hand. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 national convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nOn Akpanudoedehe\u2019s absence from the meeting, Buni explained, \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of the CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not a formal meeting that one will ask whether the secretary is here or not. However, he was in the house earlier today.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Bello said the party had made significant progress in preparations for its national convention in the past week.\n\nHe stated, \u201cFor the past one week, I have been acting as the chairman of the CECPC and what I can tell you is that we made lots of progress towards our convention like we saw in the inauguration of the state chairmen, adopted some of the zoning formulae, and some of the decisions of the CECPC taken before he left the country.\n\n\u201cI can tell you for free that in the last one week, we have ensured that we are good to go for the convention.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement, Buni pledged not to reverse the decisions taken in his absence, especially with regards to the membership of the sub-committees set up to plan the convention.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the APC had released a new list of the sub-committees showing that there had been a minor shake-up. For instance, a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, who had been removed from the media sub-committee, was returned in the new list, while Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State replaced a former governor of Bauchi State, Muhammad Abubakar, as the Chairman of the Election/Planning Sub-committee.\n\nIn a statement shortly after, however, Buni said he would not be reversing the actions of Bello and asked members of the public to discountenance the new list.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018Rebuttal\u2019, Buni carpeted reports and insinuations that he was going to reverse every action taken by the Bello-led committee, including the zoning arrangement.\n\n\u201cAll activities that were done in my absence remain valid and binding,\u201d Buni stated.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThis is to bring to the notice of all stakeholders and members of the party that the purported suspension of some activities initiated and executed by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee under the acting Chairman and Niger State Governor, H. E. Muhammed Sanni Bello, is not true.\n\n\u201cTherefore, all activities that were done in my absence remain valid and binding. All party stakeholders and members are hereby advised to disregard the previous statement discarding the activities of the committee under the leadership of the acting chairman.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Emefiele moves to get more women into banks\u2019 top management",
          "text": "Godwin Emefiele\n\nBy Emma Ujah, Abuja Bureau Chief\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has issued gender-mandated regulations to pave the way for more women at the top management levels in the banking industry.\n\nThe governor of CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, disclosed this, yesterday, while addressing participants at a webinar hosted by the Deputy Governor in charge of the Financial System Stability, FSS, Directorate, Mrs. Aishah Ahmad, as part of activities to commemorate the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day, IWD, by the apex bank.\n\nA statement by the bank said Emefiele disclosed that he had issued a policy that required a minimum of 30 per cent of female representation on boards and 40 per cent at the top management level in the banking industry.\n\nThis, he said, was similar to the National Financial Inclusion Strategy recommending increasing female staff of microfinance banks to 30 per cent.\n\nHe said CBN had since surpassed affirmative action, with 32 per cent of the total workforce being female.\n\nAccording to him, thebBank, in an effort to increase representation of women in the industry, has been using the gender diversity model as part of the criteria for approving the membership of boards of institutions under its regulatory purview.\n\nHe emphasized that such gender mandates were necessary to break the bias in the Nigerian banking industry, stressing that eight of the 23 bank CEOs, representing 35 per cent, are women, which is way above the global average.\n\nEmefiele stated further that the CBN, under his watch, had \u201cdemonstrated its commitment to diversity and inclusiveness by designing and implementing a wide variety of initiatives, programmes and interventions to promote entrepreneurship, reduce poverty, generate employment and deepen financial inclusion for women.\n\nThe governor disclosed that females had benefited hugely from the bank\u2019s intervention programmes, such as the Agribusiness Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) and the COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility (TCF). Specifically, he said that out of N134.67 billion disbursed to 37,273 AGSMEIS beneficiaries, as of January 2022, 33 per cent (N44.1 billion) went to 12,511 female beneficiaries.\n\nSimilarly, out of N349.51 billion disbursed to 712,442 total beneficiaries under the TCF, he said 45 per cent (N159.21 bn) went to 330,128 female beneficiaries, adding that the MSME Development Fund (MSMEDF) was designed to allocate at least 60 per cent of the fund to women and women-owned enterprises of which 60.3 per cent of the of 229,579 beneficiaries are women. Furthermore, he said out of the 211,306 financial statements currently registered in the collateral registry, 92,091, representing 43.6 per cent were female borrowers.\n\nCiting reports to support claims about gender parity in the workplace among other issues bordering on discrimination, he said that the CBN recognized the positive impact of gender parity on the economy, achieving the SDGs and climate targets.\n\nEarlier in her welcome remarks, the Deputy Governor, Financial System Stability, FSS, Mrs. Aisha Ahmad, said the commemoration of the International Women\u2019s Day was an opportunity to celebrate women for their progress, achievements and contributions to the society.\n\nSpeaking on the campaign theme of this year\u2019s celebrations, she noted that age, ethnicity, religion and other biases had to be broken for women to realize and fulfill their full potential without which a sustainable future would not be achievable.\n\nIn her address, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said the federal government was prioritizing domestic revenue mobilization in its efforts toward addressing fiscal constraints.\n\nHe said: \u201cRecognising that Nigeria is contending with increasing fiscal and domestic revenue constraints, the federal government is prioritising fiscal policies and reforms aimed at not only providing short and medium term relief but also at sustainability addressing the longstanding challenge of domestic revenue mobilisation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the theme, \u201cGender Equality Today for A Sustainable Tomorrow\u201d, the minister argued: \u201cThe economic and social empowerment of women and girls is critical to our collective vision of a prosperous and resilient Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf we are to have a stronger and more inclusive economy, it is crucial that we take a long-term and strategic approach to ensuring that women are economically empowered.\n\n\u201cWe must continue working towards the development and implementation of policies, regulatory frameworks, and programmes that are inclusive and gender-sensitive; and we must remove the socio-economic and cultural barriers that prevent women from participating fully in society and from reaping the economic benefits of their participation.\u201d",

I wish to add that the act exhibited by the former first lady was indecorous and unbecoming of a woman who had acted as a mother of the state and even desirous of serving in other capacities.\n\n\u201cMore condemnable is even the gutter and vulgar language used by Mrs Obiano to describe her fellow woman, who is even a widow. I have always held the view that it is only weak minds that label hardworking women like Bianca with nasty names.\n\n\u201cAnd it is more unfortunate when a woman, especially one that has been around the corridors of power, is the one hurling such baseless and regretful invectives against her fellow woman.

Only a few days ago, an innocent woman was publicly paraded naked in the same community our former first lady\n\n\u201cHails from and one would have thought that rather than showcase this brute nature of fighting and engaging in public fisticuffs with her guest, she should have exerted same energy and fighting spirit in ensuring that justice is done for that widow. It saddens me a great deal\n\n\u201cTo see the wife of an illustrious Anambra son, the pride of Ndigbo and an achiever that was once an ambassador of the Federal Republic, being attacked unprovoked and I join all right thinking persons in praying that we never ever record this type of travesty again in our history As a state.\u201d\n\nMy attention has been drawn to the shameful conduct of the wife of the ex-governor and former first lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano, who threw decorum away and attacked Her Excellency, Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu at today's inauguration ceremony and I hereby condemn\u2026 pic.twitter.com/1VnzjIfH1n \u2014 Senator Stella Oduah (@stellaoduah) March 17, 2022",

His presidential ambition will be fruitful and we are here to tell Nigerians that we are fully in support. His coming as the President of Nigeria will address all the challenges facing our dear nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe essence of this rally is to pledge our solidarity that is unshakable, immovable to our dear great son David Umahi. And I want to say this because I know the whole world is watching us. This is an Impromptu rally and you can see the crowd that came to say, we support you, our governor.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to discuss court judgment because it is prejudice to start discussing what is in court but one thing is certain when God says yes! nobody can say no. One thing is certain, God is not an author of confusion. One thing is certain, God is the finisher, the beginning, and the end. One thing is certain, God does not lose his own and one thing is certain the bible said surly they will gather but because the gathering is not of God they will scatter\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have challenged the Facebook people to come out physically. Come and do your rally, if you do it successfully we know you are in charge. They are in Abuja, those disgruntled elements, Facebook elements dishing out falsehood, dishing out lies. But one thing I know is David Umahi is still onboard as the governor of this State\u201d.\n\n\u201cPut together the 16 years of the past administrations and 7 years of this government, this young man has surpassed them but it is not by his power but by the grace of God. This fight is God\u2019s own fight, so if you have not been sleeping, go home and sleep, sleep and sleep\u201d.\n\n\u201cI stand on this ground that anyone who wants to stand on the way of our son, by 2023 they will be on their sickbed to hear the story, the President said.\n\nThe people, therefore, called on Nigerians to rally around Umahi as his ambition will unite and integrate the Nation more strongly.",

I have already addressed that matter which coincided with the geopolitical tension in Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\u201cPrices of crude oil went up exponentially beyond levels expected. As you all know, when crude oil prices rise to that level, it can also affect the derivatives of crude oil.\n\n\u201cNigerians are suffering because of the high diesel prices, including everywhere else globally.\n\n\u201cThis is not peculiar to us at all. Diesel is a deregulated product and therefore, when the prices go up internationally, it affects the price also in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, the minister said the trucks that could move petroleum products that ran on diesel were impacted and could not really cope with the high diesel prices.\n\nThough he said the products were available in the depots, the trucks could not move the product because of the high cost of transportation.\n\nThis, he said, brought in another dimension to the crisis.\n\n\u201cIf any deport owner increases price or any fuel station tries to take advantage of the situation, the public should report immediately.\n\n\u201cIf we do not get the report, we cannot know what is going on or sanction them,\u201d he said.",

They all refused after given reasons on how they won\u2019t get their returns.\n\n\u201cI knew that one day, they will come and invest to open up the state, and that is what we are witnessing today.

          "text": "The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered a former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Mohammed Umar Dikko (Rtd), to refund N57million to the Federal Government within seven days or lose his house in Abuja.\n\nThe court, in a judgement delivered by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, held that the sum, which was used for the renovation of a personal property that belonged to the former Air Chief, should be returned back to the coffers of the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nIt noted that the money was transferred into an account belonging to Capital Law Office and used for the renovation/improvement of Dikko\u2019s property situated at No. 1853 Deng Xiao Ping Street, Off Mahathir Mohammed Street, Asokoro Extension Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe Defendant shall file a Report of Compliance with the above order with the Registry of this Court and serve a copy of same on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission within 10 working days from today.\n\n\u201cIn the event of failure by the Defendant to comply with the above orders of the Court, the Defendant\u2019s property known as House No. 1853 Deng Xiao Ping Street, Off Mahathir Mohammed Street, Asokoro Extension Abuja shall stand permanently forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria as a tainted asset,\u201d Justice Dimgba held.\n\nDikko, who piloted the affairs of the Nigerian Air, NAF, between September 2010 and October 2012, was arraigned before the court on January 25, 2017 by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nEFCC had in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/CR/92/2016, accused him of complicity in money laundering and procurement fraud, to the tune of about N9.7 billion.\n\nThe anti-graft agency, among other things, alleged that the Defendant, while in office as the Air Force Chief, withdrew N700m from the NAF account, and used same to purchase a choice property at a highbrow area within the Maitama District of Abuja.\n\nHe was further alleged to have fraudulently withdrawn N500m from the said NAF account to buy a four-bedroom duplex at Road 3B, Street 2, in Mabushi Ministers Hill, Abuja.\n\nAlso, EFCC, told the court that the defendant also took N250m from the NAF\u2019s coffers to buy a property at No. 14, Audu Bako Way, GRA, Kano State in 2011.\n\nThe Prosecution closed its case on September 29, 2020, after it called a total of 12 witnesses and tendered 19 documentary evidence before the court.\n\nThereafter, the Defendant who earlier pleaded not guilty to the charge, opted to make a No Case Submission in line with Section 303 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015.\n\nHowever, the court, in a ruling it delivered on February 23, 2021, discharged and acquitted the Defendant on six out of the seven-count charge.\n\nThe court held that a holistic review of the totality of evidence before it, showed that the EFCC failed to establish a prima facie case that would warrant the Defendant to be called upon to enter his defence to the six counts.\n\nFollowing a directive of the court, the Defendant, opened his defence by appearing as his own witness in the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, in his judgement on Thursday, Justice Dimgba noted that whereas the EFCC had in the sole count of the charge pending before the court, alleged that N66m was removed from NAF account to renovate Dikko\u2019s Abuja property, he said available evidence showed that what was actually transferred out of the account was N57m.\n\nThe court held that the EFCC failed to establish that it was Dikko that gave the directive for the fund to be withdrawn for the renovation of the property.\n\n\u201cGranted that the evidence led by the Prosecution in this case is not strong enough to warrant the conviction of the Defendant as charged, it will be against good conscience for the Court to shut its eyes to the fact that the Defendant benefitted from funds belonging to the NAF, even if not in a manner sufficient to warrant his conviction for the offence that he has been charged or any other offence that he could have been found liable for.\n\n\u201cThe question that agitates my mind is: What is to be made of the sum of N57 million? Should the benefit of the funds be allowed to be retained by the Defendant so that the Defendant becomes unjustly enriched at the expense of the public?\n\n\u201cI am satisfied that the said sum of N57 million was not payment for any value received by the NAF from the Defendant nor did it fall within the lawful expenditures of the force.\n\n\u201cIt was rather made for the renovation of the Defendant\u2019s property. Allowing the Defendant to retain the benefit will be a clear case of unjust enrichment under the Law of Restitution.\n\n\u201cAny civilized system of law is bound to provide remedies in situations of this nature, so that a man is prevented from retaining funds, or some benefit derived from those funds, of another, which it is against conscience that he should keep, even if the man did not act criminally or with a mind to defraud.\n\n\u201cThe Court must be vigilant and quick to deny everyone, whether innocent of crime or guilty of same, of opportunity for unjust enrichment, or of reaping of any unjust benefit.\n\n\u201cThe duty on the court to prevent unjust enrichment in deserving cases is in my view connected to its inherent powers under Section 6(6)(a) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\n\n\u201cCourts of law can no longer sit at the sidelines and watch the perpetration of illegality or of wrongdoing in any guise.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the paramount consideration lies in what action is required to be taken in light of clear evidence showing that the Defendant has derived some benefit from a public institution which is against conscience that he should keep, even if he has not acted criminally in the context of the charge preferred against him.\n\n\u201cShould the Court be blinded while the Defendant enjoys the benefit of a public resource which are not due to him? Certainly not.\n\n\u201cThe Court must invoke its special powers and take such measures as the justice of the case dictates.\n\n\u201cTherefore, pursuant to Section 333(1) of the ACJA 2015, and the inherent powers of the Court to be exercised as the justice of the case demands, I am of the view that notwithstanding his discharge and acquittal for the reasons amply explained in the body of this judgment, the Defendant shall not be allowed to keep the benefit of the N57Million funds of the NAF actually used by the Prosecution\u2019s own witnesses (PW1, PW2 and PW6) at the time when the Defendant was the Chief of Air Staff to renovate/improve his personal property.\n\n\u201cAllowing him to retain this benefit will violate good conscience and in violation of the equitable principles of the Law of Restitution, and which abhors unjust enrichment\u201d, Justice Dimgba held.",

It was suspected that her remarks irked Ojukwu, causing her to smack Obiano, while she pulled Ojukwu\u2019s hair, before security operatives separated the two women.\n\nEarlier, THISDAY witnessed the arrival of Mrs Obiano as she was stopped at the gate, when her convoy attempted to use the main gate.\n\nShe had come late for the event, while her husband had arrived earlier, and had already inspected the guard of honour, and the swearing in ritual for the new Governor was ongoing.\n\nA barricade at the expressway, leading into the Government House was locked with keys, while Mrs Obiano was advised by security men to drive down to a junction and turn into a smaller gate that leads to the Government House.\n\nMrs Obiano who was late for the function refused. She later trekked from the road to the main gate, where she also caused a stir, before the gate was opened for her, and then trekked into the Government House, where the function held, abandoning her convoy.\n\nMrs Obiano and her husband however left the ceremony immediately after Prof Chukwuma Soludo was sworn in as governor.\n\nMeanwhile, Soludo in a press release by his media aide, Mr Joe Anatune, said the fight was caused by a breach of protocol.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cProf. Soludo hereby apologizes to all Anambra people, friends and guests who attended his inauguration this morning as the Anambra State governor for the breach of protocol.\n\n\u201cThe breach was caused by improper communication which itself arose from a personal issue between the two parties involved in the breach.\n\n\u201cSteps are being taken to resolve the misunderstanding and restore the parties to their previous relationship.\n\n\u201cAnambra State has over the years been known for a huge stock of social harmony, and the stock will increase substantially in the years ahead as part of the concerted effort to accelerate the state\u2019s development.\u201d\n\nWatch Video\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

When Chimaroke Nnamani became governor, it wasn\u2019t zoned to Nkanu, he won against somebody from the West, even in his re-election bid.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Sokowatch, an e-commerce company offering tech-enabled supply chain solutions to Africa\u2019s informal retailers, on Wednesday said it has closed a $125 million Series B equity round at a valuation of $625 million, per TechCrunch.\n\nAlongside the new funding, the company has rebranded to Wasoko, which translates to \u201cPeople of the Market\u201d in Swahili and also launched in Abidjan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Dakar (Senegal), its first locations in West Africa.\n\nInitially launched in Kenya by founder and CEO Daniel Yu in 2015, Sokowatch scaled into neighboring East African markets Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda in 2018. The West Africa expansion thus brings its total markets to 6.\n\nSokowatch explains in a statement its new brand reflects a \u201cshift from its origins as a backend distribution software platform in East Africa to a public brand providing free delivery of essential goods and working capital financing to informal retailers across opposite ends of the African continent\u201d.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhat Wasoko does\n\nMore than $600 billion of consumer goods are sold in Africa through informal retail channels every year, supplying the vast majority of the 1.2 billion population.\n\nDespite its importance, the informal retail sector still remains highly fragmented and inefficient with local shops facing a number of major challenges including frequent stockouts, limited access to capital, and difficulty receiving goods from suppliers.\n\nThrough Wasoko\u2019s platform, informal retailers are able to order products at any time via SMS or mobile app for free same-day delivery to their stores. And leveraging purchasing data, the platform also evaluates retailers to provide them with access to Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) financing.\n\n\u201cInformal retailers capture the vast majority of consumer spending in Africa, and they are dramatically underserved by existing distribution and financial infrastructure,\u201d Andrew Sugrue, Founding Partner at Avenir Growth Capital said on the VC firm\u2019s investment in Wasoko. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about what Wasoko is building and the efficiencies it brings to these retailers and their suppliers.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasoko claims to have delivered 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal with revenue growth over the past 12 months at over 500%. It currently has more than 800 full-time employees across Africa.\n\nOn why the company is expanding into francophone West African markets instead of Nigeria, which is arguably the largest market for informal retail in Africa, Yu explains to TechCrunch that the choice reflects the strong growth that its choice countries have exhibited in the region overall.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the past 10 years, both Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire have experienced solid year-on-year GDP growth,\u201d the CEO said. But Wasoko adds it is exploring expansion into Southern Africa and Nigeria nonetheless while continuing to consolidate its position across its six current countries.\n\nA mega-round for the record books\n\nLed by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth Capital, Wasoko\u2019s latest raise is the second-largest venture financing round ever secured by a non-fintech startup in Africa and the largest in the B2B retail e-commerce space, where a host of players like TradeDepot, MarketForce, Omnibiz, Alerzo, and others ply their trade.\n\nThe round comes 2 years after Wasoko closed a $14 million Series A and saw participation from VNV Global; Binny Bansal, co-founder of Flipkart; and Sujeet Kumar, co-founder of Udaan; Quona Capital; 4DX Ventures; and JAM Fund.\n\nThe new capital will enable Wasoko to drive further geographic expansion and product growth across the continent, according to the company.\n\nThe company said it is also examining opportunities to expand its product offering to verticals such as merchant point-of-sale systems, bill payments, and social commerce through both internal innovation as well as strategic investments and acquisitions of relevant companies.\n\nIn addition to the fundraising and rebranding, Wasoko has made several appointments to its senior leadership team.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka. After Akumah\u2019s exit as CEO, Akinlade Philips took the role. This new exit means Akumah no longer has ties with Farmcrowdy going forward.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nThe Task That Must Be Done.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there!\n\nEmmanuel here,\n\nAfrica\u2019s tech space is witnessing massive highs, and the media has ridden on that wave. But sometimes, we have to ask, how much of Africa\u2019s big picture narratives affect our everyday lives?\n\nLet\u2019s ponder on that as we discuss:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpleet\u2019s $625k raise\n\nJumia\u2019s ailing stocks\n\nSouth Africa vs Meta\n\nSpleet\u2019s $625k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s prop-tech startup, Spleet, has raised $625k preseed led by MetaProp VC. Other investors, including Future Africa, FEDHA Capital, VFD Group, Moonshot VC, HoaQ, CEO of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wassersturm, CEO of Flutterwave, Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, also participated in the round.\n\nSpleet plans to build financial services solutions for landlords and tenants in Africa. Planned features include tenant vetting and payment automation for landlords and a rent-now-pay-later option for tenants.\n\nWhy this matters: Renting apartments is notoriously tricky in major African cities. Both landlords and tenants are unsure what they\u2019re getting into by signing a tenancy agreement. Based on my personal bias, I believe Lagos takes the cake.\n\nDecent housing in suitable environments are rarely affordable, and affordable houses are rarely ever decent. Adding in a mix of religious, cultural, and tribalistic bias, then you\u2019re stuck with an impossible situation.\n\nWhere Spleet comes in: Spleet\u2019s overall mission is to make housing easier in Africa, but its current solution, like other proptech companies, is targeted at the premium end.\n\nSpleet CEO, Tola Adesanmi acknowledged that Spleet\u2019s initial housing marketplace did not address the grating affordability problem. He believes that the rent-now-pay-later financing solution would plug this gap.\n\nThe big picture: A financing solution only addresses part of the problems mentioned above. Frankly, only people of a relatively higher earning cadre would opt to finance an apartment that costs \u20a62 million per year ($4,000). Considering other solutions available in the space, the industry appears wide-open for further disruption.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll leave you with this piece: Why solving Nigeria\u2019s housing problem is beyond proptech startups for now\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumia\u2019s crashing stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, I regretted not buying Jumia shares, considering how much it appreciated. Today, the eCommerce company, publicly traded in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), experienced a one year low as its stocks dipped to $6.5.\n\nIn trouble regardless: In its earnings report, Jumia posted improved earnings in Q4 2021, but the overall outlook for the year remained shaky. Orders and Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) only increased marginally, but losses quadrupled to $52.5 million.\n\nRecall that for most of 2020, Jumia pushed for profitability and shifted its focus from electronics (which had higher value but less volume) to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs), which meant high volume but less value per order. It also cut down on marketing expenses.\n\nThe outcome? Jumia\u2019s losses were reduced, but so did its monthly orders and revenue.\n\nRead: 18 months into a new strategy, how close is Jumia to profitability?\n\nA U-turn: The company has reignited aggressive marketing and advertising while maintaining its focus on FMCGs.\n\nOutcome? Monthly orders, users, and revenue are increasing, but, predictably, its losses are skyrocketing once more.\n\nThe big picture: Despite its well-documented struggles, African entrepreneurs and a handful of investors are still betting on eCommerce in Africa. There\u2019s a whole lot to rummage through here.\n\nCheck this out: Betting $165 million on Africa\u2019s B2B eCommerce in 2021\n\nMeta and antitrust in South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dima Solomin on Unsplash\n\nIf you\u2019re a keen observer of global tech or a fan of Wondery\u2019s business wars, you can probably guess what\u2019s coming. A big tech company facing anti-trust allegations is, pretty much, par for the course.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, could face prosecution from the South African Competition Commission for placing restrictions on the government-owned platform, GovChat. According to the regulator, Meta had prevented the citizen-engagement platform from using its WhatsApp business APIs.\n\nWhat is GovChat? The South African government created GovChat in 2018 as a citizen engagement platform that uses the WhatsApp business API to aid real-time alerts and complaints on civic issues like potholes, faulty government facilities, COVID-19 distress, and social security applications.\n\nIt reportedly has 8.7 million active users and has processed over 582 million messages.\n\nThe elephant in the building: The regulator alleges that WhatApp Business\u2019 terms are designed to insulate it from any competition which the GovChat platform could present, but Meta completely denies this, stating that GovChat had breached terms by signing people up without going through WhatsApp\u2019s onboarding process.\n\nThe big picture: Like I pointed out earlier big tech companies might be expecting antitrust allegations every day of the week.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s economy has continued to struggle to keep up to its title \u2018Africa\u2019s largest economy\u2019 with its dwindling oil production, low standard of living, and the rising cost of goods and services.\n\nFrom stabilising its oil production which is the country\u2019s largest source of revenue to keeping its foreign reserve afloat to strengthening its weak naira, the country has a long way to go with having the strong economy it desires.\n\nHere are seven charts that shows the Nigerian economy struggles;\n\nCrude oil has been accelerating since November 2021 when it was an average of $67.57 and it has since then increased to an average of $95.22 for the month of February.\n\nPetrol-dollar economies like Nigeria anticipate an increase in price as this means more money to fund their budgets. This however isn\u2019t the case for Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy, which has seen a decline in oil production over the past months.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has continued to see instability with its oil production. According to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) report, the direct sources show that Nigeria produced 1.26 million barrels per day in February 2022 compared to the 1.42 million barrels of oil produced daily in the same month last year.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s economy unravels at worst time ahead elections\n\nThe latest oil production is a decline from the 1.39 million barrels of oil produced in January 2022.\n\n\u201cCrude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia and Libya, while production in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea declined,\u201d the report noted.\n\nWhile the oil cartel indicated that the increasing oil price might have provided ample support for the Nigerian economy.\n\nHowever, it noted that \u201cthe disruption to global trade flows and supply shortages could offset this positive impact.\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign reserve has declined to $39.86 billion as of February 28, 2022, the lowest since September 2021, when it stood at $36.78 billion. This is despite the increase in the price of crude oil, Nigeria\u2019s main source of foreign exchange.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC, said Nigeria had not benefited from the oil rally because of its low crude oil production and the rising cost of petrol subsidy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation spurred in February 2022 to 15.7 percent, the highest since October 2021 when it was 15.99 percent.\n\nThe core inflationary pressures mirrored the recent surge in the cost of energy-related products, it increased to 14.01 percent year on year in February 2022 compared to 13.87 percent in the previous month.\n\nHowever, food inflation declined to 17.11 percent compared to the previous month when 17.13 percent. This slight decrease is however not a great delight to many as it is not a true representation of the rising prices of food in the market due to the scarcity and surge in the price of fuel and higher cost of transportation.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war could also contribute to the spike in food prices which is a major contributing factor to headline inflation.\n\nNigeria should expect an outbreak of food scarcity in the next three months as adverse consequences of the Russian-Ukraine war begin to come home to roost, Aliko Dangote, chairman, and chief executive of Dangote Group has said.\n\nThe CBN said last month it would stop selling foreign currency to Banks by the end of the year to encourage them to source their own dollars and also support the government\u2019s target to lure $200 billion of inflows yearly by 2025.\n\nTo this effect, Nigeria\u2019s largest banks are reducing dollar spending limits on local currency cards to free more resources to fund imports after the central bank signalled it will stop foreign-exchange sales to banks.\n\nThis means individuals who carry out transactions above the new spending limit would now have to get a dollar card or visit the parallel market for their transactions.\n\nNigerian households have been facing difficulty as the average price for refilling a 5kg or 12.5kg cylinder of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) has continued to rise steadily over the past one year.\n\nAccording to the February 2021 Cooking Gas Watch report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the average price of 12.5kg of the commodity increased to N7,413 in January 2022 from N4178 in January 2022 while the 5kg gas increased to N3658 from N1949 in January 2021.\n\nExperts blame the price hike of cooking gas on the dearth of infrastructure, global shortfall in gas supply, inadequate local production, and shortage of Foreign Exchange, devaluation of the naira, logistic hitches and the recent introduction of VAT charges on imported gas by the Federal Government.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst said, \u201cIt is unlikely that gas prices will trend downwards in the near term considering inadequate local supply of the commodity, foreign-exchange induced pressure on importation and the fact that petroleum products will remain on the high-side for a while.\u201d\n\nThe price of Automotive Gas Oil, popularly known as diesel, has increased by almost 160 per cent in one year to N540-570 per litre in the past few days of March this year, from N235 in March last year.\n\nData gleaned from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the average price paid by consumers for diesel increased to N312 in February 2022 from N228 in the same month last year.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, followed the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nEsu Olumba-Obu, the Group managing director of Royal Farms Ltd says the high cost of diesel is posing serious threats in sustaining the group business.\n\n\u201cDue to the high cost of diesel, most businesses are now faced with the option of closing down or retrenching staff to survive,\u201d Olumba-Obu told BusinessDay.",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nIt was late Wednesday morning and I had busied myself with the day\u2019s work when a WhatsApp message propped up on my phone. I didn\u2019t bother to look. Those messages can be tiring. In a moment, however, a call came from Mr. Okey, the editor of Hallmark, nothing strange; he always calls \u2013 to ask why I hadn\u2019t done this or to say I should do that:\n\n\u201cObinna, help us do international.\u201d\n\n\u201cObinna, we have not gotten your stories,\u201d etc, etc\u2026 it\u2019s routine.\n\nBut this time around, his voice was calm, a bit more than usual, and I could sense the resignation in it.\n\n\u201cObinna,\u201d then a pause, \u201cCheck your WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nI grudgingly peeped into the phone. What else could it be but a story to work on, or a report to publish? But the words I saw left me transfixed. I didn\u2019t know what to think. A tear or two dropped from my eyes, but even as they did, I could not convince myself that the words were true. It was not possible that you had passed on. To where?\n\nI was aware, of course, that in the proceeding days, you had been in the hospital, and the feedback I got each time I inquired about you was not always encouraging. But somehow I still had this conviction that you would make it out again, stronger and better. You always did. I remember those stories you told me when we were working on your book, Saved For His Praise, about how you literally walked through the shadow of the valley of death, but made it back alive; a feat you never failed, not even for a moment, to attribute to God\u2019s grace.\n\nToday, I picked up that book again, and as I peeped through while fighting back some tears, my eyes glanced through the acknowledgement page again, and I saw the big tribute you paid to my little self for the little contribution I made in the book. I read a few pages all over again, to remind myself of some of those stories. And you know? Looking back now, I\u2019m so glad you told those stories in that book, and I am happy to have been one of those who convinced you to tell them. If not, who knows what wicked falsehood the evil people would have been peddling now that you have decided to take a break from all the stress?\n\nBut back to the stories. There was one that happened the last time you were in the UK to see your doctor, I think around 2016? At that time, it was already a matter of life or death. Your doctor, Prof Susan, you recalled, had examined you severally, but found nothing medically wrong with you, yet she could confirm that your system had so broken down that your being alive was an oddity.\n\nAs you told me, the Prof who had mistaken your 52-year-old body for an aged grandfather, and had assumed that you were your dear wife, Mrs. Betty\u2019s dad, on account of how gaunt you now looked, had advised her against flying you back to Nigeria because she was convinced you wouldn\u2019t make it back alive, even as she couldn\u2019t offer any help, but of course, you came back and not only did you make it back alive, you gradually grew stronger and agile. You are indeed a great fighter. OK you are expecting me to say you were? No, you cannot be in the past, you will always be here with us, in the spirit, in our hearts and our minds. You are alive and well, and you have only gone to rest, quite a bit. You know, it\u2019s been a long time you\u2019ve been working so hard, even when it took a lot of effort to catch a breath.\n\nThat brings me to the oxygen cylinders. The last time I was there at your house, prior to Wednesday, there were lots of them, and you had those tubes strapped to your nose; the oxygen tubes that had been your source of air, if I remember correctly, since that 2016 when you returned from the UK.\n\nYou know, I remember that brief moment that I took that air from you. You had asked me to come closer so you could show me some lines to correct on a manuscript we were working on, and I inadvertently stood on the tube. You noticed soon afterwards because you couldn\u2019t breathe any longer, yet you didn\u2019t scream at me. You only called your boy, Micah, to come and fix it, and only became agitated when he couldn\u2019t come on time. I expected you to even ask me to be more careful, but you didn\u2019t.\n\nAh! And now I remember again. About a day or two prior to that incident, you told me that you were healed; that God had healed you, and that it was only a matter of time before you got rid of the oxygen tubes and all the cylinders. I believed you, for even in my little faith, I knew that God could do it. Your faith in Him really wowed me, even against all odds, you held into Him so strongly and vowed never to seek the face of any other God.\n\nSo, when I heard about the so called passing of yours, I knew that they didn\u2019t know what they were saying. Well, I came to your house as usual, but strangely, the oxygen cylinders were gone and the tube was nowhere to be found. You were not on your \u2018sick bed,\u2019 too, and you did not call me as you often did, with that piercing voice of yours. Evidently, you had gotten rid of the oxygen cylinders as you said you would do soon. They were no longer needed because you could breathe well now, and you did not also call me because you had no more work to do, you had laboured enough, and the Almighty, whom you hung onto so tightly, had asked you to come over for your reward.\n\nBut as I sat there at your house, I couldn\u2019t help but remember how far we have come. I remembered that day in December 2014 when I walked into your office as a young job seeker who had passed the initial interview and was now qualified to meet with the boss himself, and I remember being quite nervous but I didn\u2019t show it. Well, little did I know it was the beginning of a journey\u2026\n\nBut it\u2019s getting late this Thursday night, let me publish this one and continue later.\n\nTo be continued\u2026\n\n[email protected]",

          "text": "The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has said electricity tariffs will now be increased every six months to adjust to foreign exchange and inflation requirements.\n\nThis was disclosed by Mr Sanusi Garba, the Chairman of NERC in Abuja on Wednesday, in response to concerns about rising electricity tariffs in the country.\n\nThe Commission, according to NAN, also added that the grid failure this week was as a result of a trip-off caused by the conductor snap which started from the 330 Kilo Volt Ampree (KVA) from the Benin axis and vandalism of pipelines that also supply gas to the power plants.\n\nThe NERC boss said the policy decision to stop the electricity subsidy is as announced by the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cThe subsidies have been, at one time as high as N600bn a year, and gradually coming down to about N30billion or so this year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NERC boss admitted that there was an adjustment in tariff in February this year following some economic fundamentals considered by the commission.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on February 1, 2022, is a minor review of tariff. It is very clear on our website that every six months we will adjust rates to take care of the foreign exchange component of cost and also inflation,\u201d Garba said.\n\nHe warned that Nigeria\u2019s electricity industry can not be operated on life support and that investors should be able to get their return on investment without the government stepping in to provide the required funding, adding that the DisCos are to inform customers on tariff changes.\n\nOn electricity gas supply, he said it had been restored to AFAM VI gas plant in Port Harcourt owned by Shell and the NNPC to improve power generations in Nigeria which has also been affected by gas constraints adding that\n\n\u201dThere is also another plant that has just been completed on the same site, we recently had a discussion on how that can also be brought on board to cover the shortfall in a generation.\n\n\u201cWe had a meeting two days ago to see how NNPC and shell can expedite the repair of the gas plant so that it can ramp up to cover generation.\n\n\u201cWe also have the Niger Delta power plant and the Federal Government has invested in 10 new plants out of which eight are operational.\n\n\u201cMost of them are affected by gas shortage because they have not contracted officially for gas.\u201d\n\nHe added that a lot of investments have been done in both generation and transmission to ensure a steady power supply in the country, NAN reported.\n\nThe NERC said the grid failures that happened this week started from the 330 Kilo Volt Ampree (KVA) from the Benin axis of the network due to a trip-off caused by the conductor snap.\n\n\u201cCurrently, Investigation is ongoing to unravel the cause of the trip-off and we are awaiting the final report,\u201d it said, adding that they are working with the Transmission Company of Nigeria to figure out other causes to the grid",

          "text": "The Save Nigeria Project has endorsed the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele for Presidency of the country come 2023 urging President Muhammadu Buhari to accept, anoint and project him to the Nigerian people as his choice.\n\nIn a World Press Conference by the organization held in Lagos and a statement available to LEADERSHIP on Thursday, they also passed a vote of confidence on President Buhari and also the CBN economic agenda in Nigeria.\n\nConvener of the group, Peter Abang said Emefiele has shown unprecedented sagacity as Governor of the country\u2019s central bank stating that his initiatives for small, medium, and large scale enterprises have been extraordinary and exceptional.\n\nHe stated further, \u201cIn the area of tackling unemployment, the CBN has 37 intervention funds targeted at stimulating the economy and addressing the issue of unemployment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOver 620, 000 direct and indirect jobs were created in two years as a result of the bank\u2019s intervention in the Cotton, Textile, and Garment sector. In total, the bank\u2019s development finance interventions have created over Seven Million jobs. This is the highest by any Central bank Governor in our history and indeed by any singular institution ever in the country.\u201d\n\nThe group stated that though Emefiele has not formally declared to run for the office as he is still concentrating on his job at the apex bank, they, however, urge the President to call on him to immediately begin a public presentation of himself to all citizens to ensure the message is spread appropriately.\n\nIn arriving at the choice of Emefiele, Abang pointed out that several countries in history had elected renowned economists and financial experts as leaders and they have always spearheaded impressive and speedy economic development.\n\nCiting countries like Canada, Australia, Japan, Czech Republic, Greece, India, Italy, etc who at opportune moments in their history elected economists and financial experts, called on Nigerians to queue behind Emefiele who has done well in the Central Bank and has the requisite knowledge and 26 years cognate experience coupled with the hands-on expertise at the highest level.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group stated other qualities that informed their choice to include that the candidature of Emefiele will continue, consolidate and expand the visions and landmark legacies of President Buhari.\n\nThey stated that Emefiele is a core loyalist not just verbally but in action, a thorough professional in his field of endeavor, a person whose candidature will answer perennial political questions like quenching the quest for the Igbo to be President of Nigeria and satisfying the push for the South-South to complete their one outstanding term.\n\nThey also say he has been with the President and he understands where the President wants the country to be in the nearest future adding that he is a tested and competent technocrat, a person who is detribalized, broad-minded, generally acceptable, and a believer in the unity and oneness of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe is a patriot who has been part of the success recorded and ready to sustain them. He is not a controversial person and is very accommodating of our country\u2019s diversities\u201d he added.\n\nThe group also took advantage of the briefing to alert the world on the activities of desperate politicians ahead of the 2023 general elections who had allegedly approached them and many other credible groups with a pool of funds of up to One Million Dollars to be allegedly shared by consenting groups for a massive smear campaign against the person of President Buhari, his economic agenda, the person and office of Emefiele and his policies in the CBN.\n\nThey claimed they have rejected the offer out rightly and called on Nigerians to note it once this condemnable project starts, disregard it and treat it with the disdain it deserves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to them, the modus operandi will include that the leadership of many groups will be cloned and impersonated, lies and misrepresentation of facts will be the common denominator while they will feature prime time and front page as the funding will be quite heavy noting that it had petitioned the appropriate security agency.\n\n\u201cFinally, we call on Nigerians at home and in the diaspora to key into this choice of Emefiele and also call on all leaders of note in our country who have the President\u2019s ear to also lend their voice to this generational opportunity to massively grow our economy in leaps and bounds and also generally move Nigeria forward on the fronts of justice, equity, and fairness,\u201d Abang concluded.",

          "text": "\n\nThe former governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo, Thursday, took over office from his immediate past predecessor, Chief Willie Obiano.\n\nSoludo was swore-in by the state Chief Judge, Justice Onochie Anyacheberu, after taking oath of office at exactly 9.49 am. as his deputy, Dr Onyedikachukwu Ibezim, took his at 9.15am to replace Nkem Okeke.\n\nBlueprint reports that the event took place at the front of Excos Chambers inside the state government house, the venue said to have been endorsed by the new governor, who had insisted that only 50 persons would attend the event.\n\nHowever, Blueprint correspondent reports that the event was attended by over three hundred persons including the former governor, Peter Obi, immediate past Governor, Willie Obiano and almost all outgone cabinet members (commissioners, Special Advisers and others), the state House of Assembly members which comprises 30 members, former Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Spain, Bianca Ojukwu, among others.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, governor Soludo promised to tackle insecurity and agitations through dialogue, to announce some of his principal officers before the end of work on Thursday, to commence work at Okpoko, a surburb of Onitsha the next day, to submit list of commissioners to House of Assembly in one week and conduct Local Government elections in the next two years. \u201cNow is the time to work, and there is no minute or kobo to waste in fanfare. In a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of the administration, and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra State Security Council, followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries, a meeting on Okpoko, and with my Strategy, Execution and Evaluation (SEE) team.\n\n\u201cWithin the next one week, the list of commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly. Tomorrow, we will head to Okpoko in Ogbaru Local Government Area and parts of Onitsha and Idemili as we signpost our commitment to fundamental urban regeneration, beginning with the greater Onitsha metropolis.\n\n\u201cI will work very hard every day, with you, to make Anambra proud. Every kobo of your tax money will be deployed to provide you maximum value. We will conduct local government elections. No doubt, the uniform local government system as the third federating unit is one of the contested features of our federalism. But we must make the best of a bad system, by unleashing the potential of governance at the lower levels.\n\n\u201cOver the next two years, we shall review/amend the relevant legislations, reform and strengthen the system for efficiency, restructure/strengthen the Anambra\u2019s Independent Electoral Commission, and conduct local government elections. We will collaborate and coordinate actively with LGAs to ensure synergy and complementarities. Let the revolution get to the grassroots,\u201d he stated.\n\nSpeaking in an interview, the former governor of the state, Mr Peter Obi, hailed Prof. Soludo, expressing hope that his administration would tackle the needs of the citizenry as it was anchored on security of lives, education and uplifting people from poverty.\n\n\u201cI am committed to build a greater Anambra State and Nigeria. I see hope in governor Soludo\u2019s administration because he is committed to tackle critical issues of governance. From what he said at the event and his background, you will see that he is committed to build on education, security and uplifting the plights of the poor,\u201d Obi stated.\n\nAlso speaking, the South East Coordinator, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Alhaji Gidado Siddiki, congratulated Governor Soludo, urging him to extend hands of fellowship to all irrespective of religious or ethnic inclinations with a view to get more hands to build a greater Anambra\n\nOn his part, the Transition Committee Chairman, Ogbaru Local Government Area, Hon. Arinze Awogu, said he was happy over the development especially for the fact that the new governor promised to invest on local industry by encouraging consumption and use of locally produced materials and products.\n\nRead Soludo\u2019s inaugural speech below;\n\nInaugural Address as Governor of Anambra StateGovernment House, Agu-Awka, AwkaAnambra State: 17th March, 2022\n\nCharles Chukwuma Soludo, CFRGOVERNOR, ANAMBRA STATE\n\n************************************************************************\n\nPROTOCOL\n\nUmunne m Ndi Anambra,I applied for this job; my party, (the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA) shortlisted me, and you\u2014umunne m Ndi Anambra\u2014 interviewed and employed me as your chief servant, with Dr. Onyekachukwu Gilbert Ibezim as my deputy. God ordained this moment and we are grateful to Him and to you all for the privilege to serve you. Dr. Ibezim and I will work hard every day to make you proud. I ask millions of Ndi Anambra all over the world who have prayed for today to simply say a one minute prayer to commit this journey and Anambra State unto the hands of the Almighty God. Anambra will win.\n\nBefore I go further, let\u2019s pay special tributes to hundreds of thousands of our friends and supporters who worked tirelessly to see us to this moment. It is not possible to list all of you here. I remember with deep sense of grief the three gallant police officers \u2014-Inspector Murtala Saudi, Sgt Mudassir Ahmed, and Sgt Samuel Ishaya\u2014 who lost their lives to the Unknown Gunmen who attacked us at a meeting with the youths in my village last year. We pledge to continue to take care of their families.\n\nLet me particularly thank my friend and outgoing governor of Anambra, HE (Sir) Willie Maduaburochukwu Obiano, for being an honourable gentleman and leader. On Sunday, 20th November, 2016, I accepted your proposal for gentlemen\u2019s understanding and partnership. I kept my part in 2017 and even after five years, you still kept yours in 2021. I always emphasize this point because it is rare these days to find people who keep their word in politics, and we will never take your support for granted. You are indeed a great leader. Thanks for believing in me. We will work hard to make you and Ndi Anambra proud.\n\nTo our indefatigable national Chairman, Ozonkpu (Dr) Victor Ike Oye, your visit of 27th August 2016 and unwavering support remain historical. I will continue to thank all our party members especially the members of the Board of Trustees (BOT), National Executive Committee ( NEC), State, LG and Ward Excos, Campaign Committees at all levels, etc, for the massive support.\n\nI am grateful to all the stakeholders of the Anambra Project\u2014the clergy and the church, traditional rulers, Association of Anambra Town Unions (ASATU), labour, market, trade and professional unions, youth and women organizations, non-indigenes associations, businessmen and captains of industry, the Diaspora community, persons with disabilities, etc. We thank especially the 41 self-funding support groups who propelled this movement. Our donors and the goodwill of other Nigerian stakeholders made a significant difference.\n\nThanks immensely to the 150 star-studded Transition Committee chaired by our own Dr (Mrs) Oby Ezekwesili. Let me once again put on record our debt of gratitude to the federal institutions\u2014the judiciary, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and security agencies for insisting on a transparent and credible electoral system. Eternal gratitude goes to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, and The Presidency for remaining democrats.\n\nIn particular, I thank my wife, Nonye Frances Soludo, and children: Ozonna, Ifeatu, Chinua, Ekene, Oduko and Zikora for their love and sacrifices. Despite your deep reservations, you still allowed and supported me to step out in the service of our people. As I repeatedly promised, I will work hard every day never to disappoint you. My 90-year old father is watching this live, while my late beloved mother, Mgbafor, is smiling in her grave.\n\nToday is my first day at work. I just reported for duty and will work for at least eight hours. We had more than a month since the election to celebrate our historic victory. Now is the time to work, and there is no minute or kobo to waste in fanfare. In a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of the administration, and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra State Security Council, followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries, a meeting on Okpoko, and with my Strategy, Execution and Evaluation (SEE) team.\n\nWithin the next one week, the list of commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly. Tomorrow, we will head to Okpoko in Ogbaru Local Government Area and parts of Onitsha and Idemili as we signpost our commitment to fundamental urban regeneration, beginning with the greater Onitsha metropolis.\n\nAs I stand here, I feel the weight of history. I stand on the foundation laid especially by our elected predecessors\u2014 Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe GCFR, PC, Dr Michael.I. Okpara, Chief Jim Nwobodo, Chief Christian C. Onoh, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife, Dr Chinwoke Mbadinuju, Dr Chris Ngige, OON, Mr Peter Obi, CON, and yes, our own Chief (Sir) Willie M. Obiano. You all did your best and well for our people, and I salute you all.\n\nAs I wear the APGA muffler on my neck, I feel the weight of Africa\u2019s historic progressives like the Great Zik of Africa, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, GCFR, Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, Dr M.I. Okpara, Malam Aminu Kano, Chief Joseph Tarka, Malam Balarabe Musa, Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah, etc. Not to talk of the millions of living African progressives, who still dream of Renascent Africa. We will never let them down.\n\nThe All Progressives Grand Alliance ( (initially set up as the United Progressives Grand Alliance UPGA) is a nostalgic rebirth of the grand alliance of progressives in the First Republic comprising Azikiwe\u2019s NCNC, Awolowo\u2019s AG, Joseph Tarka\u2019s United Middle Belt Congress, Aminu Kano\u2019s Northern Elements Progressive Union NEPU, etc. As the first true progressive party in Nigeria since 1999, our ideology is a combination of Zik\u2019s neo welfarism, Awolowo\u2019s scientific socialism, and Aminu Kano\u2019s democratic humanism, to form what we see as the Pan African market progressivism.\n\nIt is a Pan Africanist ideology that integrates the social democratic values with the principles of competitive markets. Anambra under our watch will mirror this ideology, and we believe that this should be Nigeria\u2019s compass to the future. We will seek active collaboration and cooperation with the Federal Government, our neighbouring and other states as well as the international community to provide our state truly people-centred governance. We will consolidate the progress made under our predecessors to continue Anambra\u2019s upward trajectory.\n\nToday, I stand up for the millions of Ndi Anambra for whom this mandate means everything. The hopes and expectations rise up to the heavens. Understandably, all of us wish that I could perform miracles \u2013 by waving my hands and all our problems will be solved. I hear you. I feel your pulse. For your sake I keep awake at night, sometimes having palpitations about not letting you down. Well, since God is the Miracle Worker, I will look up to Him in prayer and faith as we all start the work ahead of us. I see and feel all the humungous challenges. I know the lean financial base of the state. I know the limitations imposed upon a subnational state such as Anambra by the peculiar structure of our federation. But here\u2019s my promise: I will give it my all. I will work very hard every day, with you, to make Anambra proud. Every kobo of your tax money will be deployed to provide you maximum value.\n\nPeople ask me why we are not celebrating today as it has become customary. My response is that we all\u2014party members, supporters, family and friends\u2013 celebrated in thanksgiving and prayers after you decided to employ me last November 6 and 9. But today, my first day at work, is not a day for celebration. First, there is no venue that can contain the tens of thousands of Ndi Anambra and friends all over the world who would wish to join us on this historic occasion. Second, the State cannot afford any such expensive ceremonies. Third, and as a matter of personal philosophy and as a true progressive, I do not subscribe to using the paltry tax collected from the women selling pepper on the roadside or the okada/keke drivers on a fleeting fanfare and banquet.\n\nI insisted that this event must not cost the government of Anambra one kobo. I would rather use such resources to lay the foundation stone for a public hospital at Okpoko or elsewhere or empower our security agents to fight criminality. Today, I come with a sober heart, conscious of the enormity of responsibilities on our shoulders and the challenges ahead.\n\nYes, there will be a time to celebrate. We will celebrate when: security of life and property is guaranteed and law and order restored; every child of schooling age is in school; every school child is receiving the 21st century education for the digital age; everyone, especially children and women can access quality healthcare; the cost of doing business is down to near zero; our roads are tarred and we have an efficient transportation system with no one having to wait in traffic for more than a few minutes; we have access to 24 hour electricity; our streets are clean and green; our cities, communities and markets are planned and cleaned; the many millions of Charlie Nwamgbafors and the vulnerable persons are lifted up to realize their God given potential; all our pensioners receive their gratuities;, workers are paid their leave allowances and contractors are paid; our youth can get jobs and business opportunities; the youth in Okpoko \u2018Zone 9\u2019 become global serial entrepreneurs; poverty is near zero and income levels rising\u2026etc. Yes, I will not celebrate, and certainly not with the tax payers\u2019 money.\n\nUmunne m Ndi Anambra!I come to this job prepared to serve you. For 12 years since 2009 when I first indicated interest to serve you, I persevered through the turbulent politics and here we are. Once again, I present to you the Soludo Solution\u2014our contract with the people which we intend to vigorously implement subject to resource availability.\n\nOur contract with Anambra people derives from three seminal documents: (a) \u201cAnambra Vision 2070\u2014a 50-Year Development Plan\u201d which I chaired the drafting; (b) \u201cThe Soludo Solution: A People\u2019s Manifesto for a Greater Anambra\u201d; and (c) \u201cThe Transition Committee (Combined) Report\u201d\u2014which built upon the first two.\n\nIn sum, this is an agenda for an itinerant tribe in search of a livable and prosperous homeland. Driven by the philosophy of One Anambra, One People, One Agenda, our goal is to build Anambra into a livable and prosperous smart megacity. We aim to transit beyond petroleum into the digital world of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and envision Anambra as an industrial, technology, and leisure/entertainment hub of West Africa.\n\nOur detailed Plan rests on five key pillars: law and order (homeland peace and security); economic transformation as Nigeria\u2019s next axis of industrial-tech and leisure; competitive and progressive social agenda (education, health, youth, women and vulnerable groups); Governance, rule of law and a rebirth of our value system; and aggressively tackling our existential threat posed by the environment\u2014towards a clean, green, planned and sustainable cities, communities, and markets. For me, this agenda is also personal: I am here to build a society where I would be proud to live in after leaving office.\n\nNdi be anyi, what we propose is that we collectively build a new social and economic order that guarantees and defends economic freedom and reward of private enterprise to secure our future such that any child born in Anambra will have little incentive to rush elsewhere in search of opportunities and anyone persecuted anywhere in the world can return to a happy and prosperous homeland. Such a new order will, of necessity, entail a massive disruptive change and creative destruction, with short-term pains but guaranteed long-term benefits. As a humane and progressive government, we shall strive to deliver the difficult change with a human face.\n\nAs we transit into a non-oil economy, our strategy is a small open economy framework embedded in 21st Century imperative of Everything Technology: we seek to bring the world to Anambra and take Anambra to the world especially in the context of the African continental free trade area (AfCFTA). Our \u201cMade in Anambra\u201d and \u201cAnambra Standards\u201d agenda underpin this strategy. If you can produce it in Anambra, I will be your chief marketing officer, provided that your standard meets the \u201cAnambra standard\u201d\u2014which is excellence. The Anambra State Government will only patronize Made in Anambra products and services unless such goods or services are not currently made in Anambra, then made in Nigeria, Africa, etc, in that sequence. When you see me in Innoson vehicles or in my Akwete dress with a pair of shoes made in Ogbunike/Nkwelle Ezunaka and Onitsha, we are making a statement.\n\nToday, the light refreshment to be served after this brief event is abacha from Umunze, ukwa from Isuofia, Anambra rice with ofe akwu, nkwu enu from Awgbu, ngwo from Awa and Oba, and malt and bottled water from Onitsha.\n\nAs part of our \u201cmade in Anambra\u201d, cultural renaissance and healthy living agenda, when you come to the Governor\u2019s Lodge or attend any state government\u2019s function, be sure to be served only \u201cMade in Anambra\u201d. We want to go back to where M.I. Okpara stopped with the palm revolution and plant millions of palm trees. In some years, we will seek not only to export palm produce but also fresh palm wine from Anambra State.\n\nWe will seek active collaboration with the federal government not only to export manufactured and agricultural products, but also services (especially tech, leisure/entertainment, and skills/talents as we seek an educational system whose products are productive at home and exportable). Anambra\u2019s greatest resource is our human capital, and we shall grow and mine this resource to its maximum, leveraging on technology.\n\nWe will soon inaugurate the Anambra Innovation and Technology Advisory Council to drive the emergence of the digital tribe and mainstreaming technology and innovation across all aspects of our lives, our International Investment Council, our Global Friends of Anambra in Development, as well as the Council on the Ease of Doing Business.\n\nWe will conduct local government elections. No doubt, the uniform local government system as the third federating unit is one of the contested features of our federalism. But we must make the best of a bad system, by unleashing the potential of governance at the lower levels. Over the next two years, we shall review/amend the relevant legislations, reform and strengthen the system for efficiency, restructure/strengthen the Anambra\u2019s Independent Electoral Commission, and conduct local government elections. We will collaborate and coordinate actively with LGAs to ensure synergy and complementarities. Let the revolution get to the grassroots.\n\nWe shall reinvigorate and mainstream the public-community-private partnership (PCPP) \u2013 as a veritable framework for service delivery and development. We will develop pragmatic frameworks for private sector and communities to: adopt schools, build roads/infrastructure, manage government assets, receive and manage development matching grants; participate in sanitation and securing law and order, etc. There is a subtle but powerful revolution underway, raising the bar on our age-old community development model.\n\nYes, every community embarks upon community development. Besides the well-known Nnewi model, some communities such as Neni and Adazi Ani are showing new examples. At Neni, an individual has tarred 18 kilometres of road (together with others at 24 kilometres in the community) and they are now refurbishing and empowering public schools in their community; an individual in Adazi Ani has done 13 kilometres and wants to surpass the Neni record. The Government will provide a framework to incentivize and unleash the momentum of this new phenomenon at the village/community levels.\n\nOur government is committed to promoting the expeditious dispensation of justice especially the prompt resolution of commercial disputes. We shall collaborate with the Chief Judge and his colleagues to significantly improve the physical and technological infrastructure of the courts, and hopefully also implement some structural reforms to fast-track the path to justice and make Anambra the number one in the speedy dispensation of justice and ease of doing business.\n\nPart of our future is in our past. We will mainstream our values of hard work, integrity, compassion, and sanctity of life. The fringe but destructive minority which embodies the \u201cget rich quick by all means\u201d philosophy, cultism, drug addiction, blood-letting criminality, kidnapping, etc do not represent us, and cannot define us. As a new social order and \u201ceverything technology\u201d philosophy take life, many unproductive systems will give way. There will be new and better ways of managing our parks and markets, different and better ways of collecting government revenue, managing waste, and general service delivery to citizens.\n\nThe land registry will be digitized; we shall leverage technology to ensure a responsive and accountable public service together with our initiative for an ID Card for every Anambra person wherever he/she may be; and a code of conduct for political appointees to mainstream servant leadership by example.\n\nWe must rid Onitsha and all our roads and markets of revenue touts and make shopping in Anambra a pleasurable experience. Today, I will sign an executive order to suspend all revenue contracts operating in the parks, markets and roads until we put in place a new system within the next four weeks. Consequently as from tomorrow, 18th March, 2022, if anyone asks you to pay CASH to him as revenue to the government in the parks, markets and roads, such a person must be a thief. Market unions must also stop harassing customers.\n\nWe shall embark upon massive training and social re-engineering to wean people off the old unproductive ways. As a humane government, we shall endeavor to offer alternative opportunities to the revenue touts. Over the next two years, many will complain that \u201cit is not the way we do it\u201d, but we can\u2019t repeat the same thing and expect a different result. During the coming months, we shall embark upon bold but difficult reforms and these reforms may be unpopular especially among those benefitting from the existing order. For sure, the revenue and park mafia that rake in billions of government revenue into their private pockets won\u2019t be happy. But we commit to doing the right things. And we plead for your understanding, patience and cooperation. By His grace, Anambra will win!\n\nBut Anambra State is a subnational entity, within the context of Nigeria\u2019s unitary-federalism. The speed of its progress is in part dependent upon both the threats and opportunities inherent in such a system. The ongoing Constitutional amendment at the National Assembly is welcome, albeit that some of the proposals merely tinker at the margins and attempting to do more of the same. The subnational states need to be unleashed. For too long, Nigeria has tried a top-down strategy; now is the time to try the bottom-up approach, and that\u2019s part of my motivation. While we debate how far and how fast the devolution and reconfigurations will go, the world is not waiting. As the world transits away from oil into cleaner energy sources and a world of 4th Industrial Revolution, Nigeria needs a fundamentally different rule-book to survive and compete. We will seek to optimize the limited headroom allowed by the current peculiar structure to give our people a new life.\n\nUmunne m Ndi Anambra,Besides the environment, a fundamental existential threat to our state and indeed Igboland is that of peace building and law and order. We can\u2019t build this homeland by turning the sword against each other. Ndi Anambra love their homeland but the recent upsurge in criminality poses a great threat. My heart bleeds to see and hear about our youth dying in senseless circumstances. Every criminal gang\u2014kidnappers, wicked murderers, arsonists, rapists, thieves\u2014 all now claim to be freedom fighters. Criminality cannot be sugarcoated. This must stop.\n\nAll the stakeholders must now review both the narrative and the action plan. For starters, I endorse the recent statement (March 7, 2022) by the Joint Body of South East Council of Traditional Rulers and Bishops/Archbishops on Peace and Conflict Resolution, requesting for a tripartite discussion between them, The Presidency, and South East governors to deal with the conflicts in the South East especially in relation to Nnamdi Kanu and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN). There is no conflict that dialogue, in good faith, cannot resolve. Our government is determined to urgently restore peace and security in Anambra, and we will seek the active cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders.\n\nTo IPOB/ESN, the Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), as well as the disparate armed groups in the forests, it is time to interrogate both the purpose and means of your campaign. To the politicians playing politics with the insecurity, you are riding a tiger. The current trajectory is a road to desolation. Let us get around the table and talk. Let the elite in the closet come out, and let\u2019s debate our future and forge a consensus. The conspiracy of silence by the elite and some community leaders must end. If you see something, say or do something! Securing Igboland and Nigeria must be our collective responsibility. Let those in the forests come out, surrender their guns and let\u2019s work together to rehabilitate and empower you to contribute positively to the peace and prosperity of our homeland\n\nA significant part of our state economy is powered by artisans, keke drivers, vulcanizers, hairdressers, cart pushers, petty traders, bricklayers, women frying akara, and all those who depend upon daily toil and sweat to feed their families. Every day, there is a \u201csit at home\u201d, these poor masses lose an estimated N19.6 billion in Anambra alone. Due to the protracted breakdown of law and order, businesses are relocating outside Igboland, with growing unemployment, and traders who used to come to shop in Onitsha, Aba etc are going elsewhere. Who is losing? By forcing our children\u2014the future of Igboland\u2014to stay at home instead of being in school, while even the critically sick people (including pregnant women) cannot go to hospital, we harm our future .\n\nI hereby challenge any of the disparate groups that claims that it is not part of the senseless killings and kidnappings to step out and show leadership by joining hands with us to DO something about it. If you love our homeland, there is no place for bloodshed. Our Lord Jesus Christ admonished in Matthew 26: 52: \u201cput your sword back in its sheath, for all who live by the sword will die by the sword\u201d. In the traditional religion, the land places a curse upon those who spill the blood of the innocent.\n\nFor me, this issue is personal and emotional. My mother died during the civil war; our last born, Chukwuemeka died during the war; my father bore a bullet inside him for years; my elder brother \u2013 at 16, was in the \u2018Boys Company\u2019. At 8, I became the \u201cman of the house\u201d, with all the men at the war front. My uncles, cousins, etc, died during the war. This is 2022, and there are certainly far better ways to protest than shedding the blood of the innocent or resorting to criminality.\n\nThat is why I call on all of us today to join hands with me to execute the real agenda\u2014a livable and prosperous homeland of opportunities and jobs for our youth while maximizing the benefits of a united Nigeria/Africa. With Ohanaeze\u2019s estimate that some 11.6 million Igbos live in the North and over 7 million in Lagos state and over 70% of our non-land assets scattered all over Nigeria and the world, we need Nigeria and Nigeria needs us. We need Africa and the world and they need us.\n\nYes, we have heard every genuine agitation for fairness, justice, equity and equality in the Nigerian Federation. No, we refuse to turn our homeland into a crime scene and all manners of criminality. No group has ever succeeded in any struggle in history by turning the sword against themselves. I promise to work hard with other governors and leaders in the South East and others to take your agitations to the table of all Nigeria, and we hope to bargain for a win-win solution for all Nigeria. I will engage all parties to the breakdown of peace and order in Anambra from a point of determination to solve problems and resolve disagreements with openness, integrity, equity and justice. I will absolutely invest my political capital within our State, our South East and with the Presidency, Federal Government and its establishments as a matter of topmost priority. With good faith and hard work by all parties, I am convinced that justice, peace and order will return to Anambra and the South East within the shortest possible horizon.\n\nUmunne m Ndi Anambra, this agenda is premised upon your irrepressible and communal spirit. It is you\u2014the people\u2014that will make it happen. We all love our homeland to death, and we can turn it into whatever we will that it should be. A new servant leadership and a new homeland consciousness by the people will get us there despite the huge challenges. For example, to effectively implement our ambitious agenda, we need annual investment levels of 25- 30% of state gross domestic product (GDP), that is about $2.58 \u2013 $3.09 billion. At current levels, public sector investment is less than $100 million per annum. The gap seems daunting, but we are undaunted. The internally generated revenue is barely 0.5% of state GDP.\n\nThis presents immense opportunity as well as threat in the context of a rentier culture where the social contract/trust between the citizen and the government is broken, and the people do not believe that they can get value for their taxes. We are determined to change this.\n\nI pledge here again to devote every kobo of your tax money to work for you. This is your government. I am only your employee. I commit to a transparent, accountable, judicious, and impactful use of your tax money. My litmus test for every expenditure will be to ask two questions: a) if this is my hard earned money from work and profit, can I spend it this way? b) Is this the best way to spend the taxes and levies collected from the poor traders and okada riders? If I cannot answer Yes to both questions, then I will hesitate to do so.\n\nOn your part, we need a new chapter of active and responsive citizenship, imbued with civic responsibilities and participation. Pay your fair share of tax and sanitation and other levies and try us. I paid my 2021 tax to Anambra (over N10 million). The keke drivers pay over N90,000 per annum; the women selling pepper and hawkers who pay N200 per day average at least N50,000 per annum; etc. What about you\u2014the shop owner/trader, lawyer, doctor, consultant, journalist, professionals, business owner, landlord, etc? You want security, good transport network without traffic, good schools and hospitals, water, clean, green and planned environment, etc. How much do you pay per month/year? Ndi Anambra outside Anambra must creatively pay their taxes in their primary residence\u2014Anambra. With a new homeland consciousness, the estimated over 10 million Ndi Anambra outside the State can collectively turn their homeland into the new axis of prosperity.\n\nIn addition to our civic duties as responsible citizens, I call on all of us to go the extra mile in volunteering our time and treasure to create the homeland of our dream. Everybody is important in this journey and I need your help to succeed. We must all strive to die empty\u2014to give our all, in aid of God\u2019s creation. Each day, every Onye Anambra must ask himself or /herself: \u201cwhat have I done today to make my home state livable and prosperous?\u201d It should be part of our daily devotion. There must be a purpose why God in His infinite wisdom decided to make you Onye Anambra\u2014and that must be to leave it better than you met it. No one is too poor to give or do something for Anambra. If not you, then who; if not now, then when?\n\nAs I close my eyes and visualize our future, I can see millions of Ndi Anambra holding hands and working hard for a glorious future; I see the skyscrapers along the banks of River Niger in Onitsha, Nnewi, Awka, Ekwulobia, etc. I see a smart megacity with millions of happy and prosperous people. I see us exporting massively to the world and the world coming to Anambra as a preferred destination to live, work, invest, learn, relax and enjoy. History beckons. Seize this moment Ndi Anambra, and together, let us make it count. Anambra: the Light of the Nation shines\u2026.!\n\nGod bless you all!",
          "summary": "Today, I stand up for the millions of Ndi Anambra for whom this mandate means everything.\nIn some years, we will seek not only to export palm produce but also fresh palm wine from Anambra State.\nUmunne m Ndi Anambra, this agenda is premised upon your irrepressible and communal spirit.\nNdi Anambra outside Anambra must creatively pay their taxes in their primary residence\u2014Anambra.\nSeize this moment Ndi Anambra, and together, let us make it count.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, has met with Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello, who acted as the leader of the party in his absence.\n\nBoth governors met at the Yobe Governor\u2019s Logde in Abuja on Thursday after Governor Buni returned to the country from a medical trip, amid reports of a leadership tussle in the party.\n\nGovernor Buni, however, insisted that the actions of the party, led by Governor Bello, stood, reiterating an earlier statement he issued clarifying that no decision taken in his absence has been overturned.\n\nREAD ALSO: All Actions Taken By Gov Bello In My Absence \u2018Remain Valid\u2019 \u2013 Buni\n\n\u201cSince I travelled, you know the party has not stopped and his excellency (Governor Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party,\u201d he said, adding that the March 26 date scheduled for the APC national convention was sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here to discuss the issues going forward. We are now at the finishing line. Of course, you know the convention is at hand, on the 26th of March. So, we are putting heads together to ensure that we achieve the accomplishment.\u201d\n\nAsked why the Secretary of the APC CECPC Senator John James Akpanudeodehe was not at the meeting, Governor Buni said it was not a formal meeting.\n\n\u201cYou can see that they\u2019ve come to welcome me and to wish me well again because I\u2019m coming from a medical trip. So, it\u2019s not a formal meeting that you will ask if the secretary is here or not,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that Senator Akpanudoedehe was at his house earlier.\n\nGovernor Bello on his part said that while he was acting national chairman of the party, a lot of progressive was made towards holding the national convention.\n\n\u201cWe swore in the state party chairmen, we adopted some of the zoning systems and we adopted some of the decisions of the CECPC (taken) before he (Buni) left,\u201d he said.\n\nA delayed convention\n\nGovernor Buni and Bello\u2019s meeting comes after reports of a rift within the APC leadership had emerged last week.\n\nThere had been speculations that Governor Buni was planning to postpone the APC convention for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe convention has been postponed more than once since Buni, who is also the Governor of Yobe State, was appointed caretaker Chairman.\n\nOn March 7, Governor Bello declared himself the acting National Chairman of the CECPC while Buni was away, raising tensions that the latter had been removed permanently with the blessing of the President.\n\nAmid heavy security at the APC secretariat in Abuja, Bello swiftly swore in the party\u2019s 36 State Chairmen, part of activities scheduled before the convention.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Secretary of the APC, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe was forced to deny reports that he had resigned from his position.\n\nHe also alleged that there were plans to remove him from his position.\n\n\u2018Just a game\u2019\n\nReacting to the unravelling situation, Kogi State and APC Senator Smart Adeyemi told Channels Television his colleagues in the National Assembly were not aware that President Muhammadu Buhari had sanctioned Buni\u2019s sack.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the Senate, we are not aware that Mr President gave a marching order to the acting Chairman to vacate his office,\u201d Mr Adeyemi said.\n\nHe added that the controversy was generated by people who have \u201cone interest or the other to protect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is just a game,\u201d he said. \u201cMai Mala Buni performed excellently well, he brought in seasoned people, Governors, former Generals, statesmen, he brought them back to the APC. So today the APC is more formidable. In fact we owe him some level of gratitude.\n\n\u201cBuni came when there was crisis in the APC, when the APC was almost collapsing. And he has succeeded to put the party together. And consolidated the party, and we are cruising to victory.\u201d\n\n\u2018Due process\u2019\n\nImo State Governor Hope Uzodimma also noted that Buni could not have been removed without due process.\n\n\u201cAPC is a very serious party,\u201d he said, while appearing on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today. \u201cEverything going on at the secretariat now are going on with the knowledge of Mai Mala Buni. And as soon as he comes back, he will also take over the realms of the party.\u201d\n\nTo remove Buni, a meeting of the National Executive Committee must be convened, Uzodimma added.\n\n\u201cThe right organ of the party to take and implement such decisions is the National Executive Committee. Have we summoned that committee? Because if we do, INEC will be invited to observe. And if they observe, whatever decision taken will be known to them.\u201d\n\n\u2018No to backstabbing\u2019\n\nLast Saturday, President Buhari had appeared to wade into the controversy for the first time, although he did not, at the time, state his position on Buni\u2019s status in the party.\n\nThe President had called for order in the APC.\n\nIn a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Garba Shehu, the President, who is in the United Kingdom for medical treatment, warned APC leaders and members to desist from name calling and backstabbing and avoid the fate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cThey failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition,\u201d the President said, as quoted in the statement.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate,\u201d the President warned.\n\n\u201cAs the country prepares for the long run up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe said the APC must remain focused on developing the nation.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible,\u201d the President said.\n\n\u201cGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nCharles Soludo has been sworn in as the fifth governor of Anambra State in a modest event that took place at the Government House on Thursday. Soludo took over from Willie Obiano.\n\nThe former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor took the oath of office alongside his deputy, Onyeka Ibezim.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Soludo promised to hit the ground running, saying some key members of his government will be announced in a few hours.\n\n\u201cToday is my first day at work. I just reported for duty at 8:55 am to be precise and will work for at least eight hours today,\u201d the newly-sworn in governor said.\n\n\u201cWe had more than a month since the election to celebrate our historic victory. Now is the time to work and there is no minute or kobo to waste in funfair. In a few minutes, I will announce some of the principal officers of my administration and commence with serious meetings of the Anambra Security Council followed by a meeting with the permanent secretaries, a meeting on Okpoko, and with my Strategy, Execution, and Evaluation (SEE) team.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the next few weeks, the list of commissioners will be laid before the House of Assembly,\u201d the Aguata-born economist, added.\n\n\u2018God Ordained This Moment\u2019\n\nHe also thanked stakeholders, his supporters, Federal Government agencies like the police, and the people of Anambra State for their roles in his election last November.\n\n\u201cUmunne m Ndi Anambra, this is the moment. I applied for this job. My party, the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APG), shortlisted me, and you, Umunne m Ndi Anambra, interviewed and employed me with Chief Dr Onyekachukwu Gilbert Ibezim as my deputy,\u201d Soludo said.\n\n\u201cGod ordained this moment and we are grateful to Him and to you all for the privilege to serve you. Dr Ibezim and I will work very hard every day to make you proud.\u201d\n\nGovernor Soludo also praised President Muhammadu Buhari for allowing the will of the Anambra people to prevail.\n\n\u201cOur eternal gratitude goes to President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) and the presidency for remaining democrats,\u201d he said, calling for more support to deliver on his campaign promises.\n\nThe event was graced by top dignitaries in the state and beyond including the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Victor Oye and wife; Speaker of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Uchenna Okafor and wife; Sen. Victor Umeh and wife; Bianca Ojukwu, clergymen, traditional rulers among others.\n\nHours before the swearing-in, security officers were seen at strategic points within and around the Government House. Guests began to arrive for the programme in the early hours of the day and were subjected to routine security checks.\n\nA circular by the state government showed that about 50 persons were invited for the ceremony as Soludo said he wanted a low-profile event.\n\nRELATED\n\nCharles Soludo Wins Anambra Governorship Election\n\nWhy Obiano Supported Me To Become Anambra Governor \u2013 Soludo\n\nAnambra Election: I Knew Soludo Would One Day Be Governor, Says Ngige\n\nCourt Dismisses Suit Challenging Soludo\u2019s Election\n\nThursday\u2019s swearing-in is the culmination of a series of events leading to the programme. A day earlier, the former governor had handed over some state documents to the new leader.\n\nIn his farewell speech, Obiano had thanked the state for the privilege to serve, asking for forgiveness from those he may have offended. According to him, his intentions were pure even though he might have stepped on some toes.\n\nHe believes in his eight-year stint, his administration delivered on its campaign promises.\n\nSoludo\u2019s inauguration came about four months after a landslide victory in the governorship poll. The APGA flagbearer defeated his closest rival, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\u2019s Valentine Ozigbo. The Isuofia-born banker won 19 of the 21 local government areas of the state to clinch the post. He got 112,229 votes, twice higher than Ozigbo who had 53,807 votes.\n\nA month after he won the election, a Federal High Court in Abuja dismissed a suit to invalidate the victory.\n\nThe suit sought to nullify his win on allegations that Soludo provided false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo in dismissing the suit said it lacked merit and was a waste of the court\u2019s time. He told the plaintiffs not to use the court as a tool to stagnate democracy and also awarded N2 million to APGA, Soludo, and Ibezim who were the second, third, and fourth respondents in the suit. INEC was the first defendant.",

More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled and thousands have died as the war enters its fourth week.\n\nUkraine\u2019s foreign ministry said Russian forces dropped a powerful bomb on a theater in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, leaving many civilians trapped and an unknown number of casualties. Reuters could not independently verify the information.\n\nMaxar Technologies, a private U.S. company, distributed satellite imagery it said was collected on March 14 and showed the word \u201cchildren\u201d in large Russian script painted on the ground outside the red-roofed building.\n\nThe theater had been housing at least 500 civilians, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cThis raises serious concerns about what the intended target was in a city where civilians have already been under siege for days and telecommunications, power, water, and heating have been almost completely cut off,\u201d Belkis Wille from the rights group said.\n\nMoscow denies targeting civilians and Russia\u2019s defense ministry said its forces had not struck the building, RIA news agency said.\n\nThirteen buses carrying around 300 refugees from Mariupol have arrived in Russia\u2019s Rostov region, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency cited the Russian defense ministry as saying on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv said Russian forces had shot dead 10 people waiting in line for bread in Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv. Russia denied the attack and said the incident was a hoax.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 top court for disputes between states ordered Russia on Wednesday to immediately halt its military operations in Ukraine, saying it was \u201cprofoundly concerned\u201d by Moscow\u2019s use of force.\n\n\u2018NEUTRAL STATUS\u2019\n\nUkraine\u2019s armed forces are conducting small-scale counter attacks on several fronts and Russian troops have not been able to gain ground because of a lack of resources, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said on Wednesday.\n\nThere were signs of compromise and progress at ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin said negotiators were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, both members of the European Union that are outside the NATO military alliance.\n\n\u201cNeutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. \u201cThere are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement.\u201d\n\nVladimir Medinsky, Russia\u2019s chief negotiator, told state TV: \u201cUkraine is offering an Austrian or Swedish version of a neutral demilitarized state, but at the same time a state with its own army and navy.\u201d\n\nAustria and Sweden, the biggest of six EU members outside NATO, both have small militaries that cooperate with the alliance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky has said Ukraine could accept international security guarantees that stopped short of its longstanding aim to join NATO. That prospect has been one of Russia\u2019s primary concerns.\n\n\u201cMy priorities during the negotiations are absolutely clear: the end of the war, guarantees of security, sovereignty, restoration of territorial integrity, real guarantees for our country, real protection for our country,\u201d Zelensky said in a video address released early on Thursday.\n\nIn a speech on Wednesday to the U.S. Congress by video link, Zelensky repeated a request for a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something the West won\u2019t introduce.\n\n\u201cIn the darkest time for our country, for the whole of Europe, I call on you to do more,\u201d he said.\n\nThe United States announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine to fight Russia, with the new package including drones, anti-armor and anti-aircraft systems.\n\n\u201cMore will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that \u2026 we are ready to transfer,\u201d Biden said, later condemning Putin.\n\n\u201cHe is a war criminal,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nNATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels also pledged more arms supplies to help Ukraine.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid access and civilian protection, but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to the fighting or withdrawal of troops.",

          "text": "Chris Cuomo wants an arbitrator to award him $125 million for his firing from CNN, alleging his bosses knew full well how he advised his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and suggested they did the same themselves.\n\nHis filing seeking arbitration on Wednesday exposed more ugliness at the network, where Cuomo, CNN chief Jeff Zucker and his top deputy, Allison Gollust, have all been ousted in the past three months.\n\nZucker fired Cuomo, host of the network\u2019s most popular prime time show, in December after a New York Attorney General\u2019s report publicly revealed new details about how he helped his brother strategize to fight sexual harassment allegations.\n\n\u201cIt should be obvious by now that Chris Cuomo did not lie to CNN about helping his brother,\u201d said his lawyer, Bryan Freedman. \u201cIn fact, as the limited information released from Warner Media\u2019s investigation makes clear, CNN\u2019s highest-level executives not only knew about Chris\u2019 involvement in helping his brother but also actively assisted the governor, both through Chris and directly themselves.\u201d\n\nThere was no comment Wednesday from a representative for Zucker and Gollust. The spokeswoman, Risa Heller, has denied in the past that Gollust, a former press aide to Gov. Cuomo, offered advice or counsel to the governor while she worked at CNN.\n\nCNN declined comment on the filing.\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Chris Cuomo interviewed his big brother on CNN nine times \u2014 a temporary lift of the network\u2019s policy that Chris Cuomo not participate in stories concerning the governor.\n\nIn his filing Wednesday, Chris Cuomo said CNN leadership demanded the interviews even though he and his brother had expressed reservations about them.\n\nHe said that Zucker and Gollust tried to strengthen the network\u2019s ties to his brother and pushed the New York governor not to appear on other networks. He said they requested the governor hold his daily briefings at a time CNN\u2019s ratings needed a boost.\n\n\u201cNetwork standards were changed in a calculated decision to boost ratings,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cWhen those practices were called into question, Chris was made the scapegoat.\u201d\n\nCuomo also dragged two former colleagues into his complaint, saying Don Lemon and Jake Tapper were never disciplined for incidents seen as ethical lapses \u2014 Lemon texting Jussie Smollett when the actor was accused of making false allegations of a racist attack, and Tapper allegedly offering advice to a politician.\n\nNetworks standards were \u201ca moving target,\u201d modified as Zucker and Gollust saw fit, the former \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d host said in the complaint.\n\nWith his journalistic integrity \u201cunjustifiably smeared,\u201d Cuomo will find it difficult to find work in his field in the future and seeks damages of $125 million, the complaint said.\n\nZucker resigned under pressure earlier this year after it was revealed he violated corporate practices by not disclosing his romance with Gollust.

          "title": "UK: Met Police Officers Who Strip Searched Black Schoolgirl Under Investigation",
          "text": "Three Metropolitan Police constables are under investigation for misconduct over their roles in either conducting or supervising the strip-search of a Black schoolgirl.\n\nThe student, known as Child Q, was subjected to \u201ctraumatic\u201d degradation by officers while on her period after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis, according to a safeguarding report which also found that racism \u201clikely played a factor\u201d. She was forced to spread her legs, use her hands to spread her buttock cheeks, and cough.\n\nStaff members at her Hackney-based secondary school called the police after falsely alleging drug possession; the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched a probe in the matter following a mandatory referral by the Met in May 2021.\n\nThe watchdog\u2019s investigation is now being finalised and a decision regarding the officers is pending.\n\nIOPC Regional Director Sal Naseem said: \u201cWe recognise the seriousness of this case and the concern it has caused in the community following the publication of the Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review into this incident.\n\n\u201cWe have now completed all lines of inquiry for our investigation and we are close to finalising our report. We will look to conclude decision making around that at the earliest opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has examined whether legislation, policies and procedures were followed during the strip search of the girl and we have looked at complaints that the girl\u2019s mother was not given the opportunity to be present during the strip search, and that there was no other appropriate adult present. We have also considered whether the girl\u2019s ethnicity played a part in the officers\u2019 decision to strip search the girl.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the impact on the secondary school pupil \u2013 referred to as Child Q \u2013 was \u201cprofound\u201d and the repercussions \u201cobvious and ongoing\u201d.\n\nFamily members described her as changing from a \u201chappy-go-lucky girl to a timid recluse that hardly speaks\u201d, who now self-harms and needs therapy.\n\nSchool staff had wrongly accused the girl of possession of cannabis months before and, despite their mistake, hypothetically threatened the child and her mother with the prospect of expulsion, in this manner: \u201cIf she is found with weed/drugs on her she will not be able to continue her place with [the school]\u201d.\n\nThe basis for the school\u2019s initial allegation was that Child Q appeared to be \u201cintoxicated\u201d, which, her mother explained, was because she\u2019d been up until late the night before studying. They also expressed concern about cannabis possession because another student, known to the girl, was excluded for drug possession months before.\n\nScotland Yard has apologised and said the incident \u201cshould never have happened\u201d.\n\nCouncillor Anntoinette Bramble, deputy mayor and cabinet member for Hackney Council\u2019s Children\u2019s Services, and the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said they were \u201cappalled\u201d by all aspects of the review.\n\nThey have asked for a report in six to nine months on progress made regarding the review\u2019s eight findings and 14 recommendations.\n\nThese include calls for the Department for Education to make more explicit reference to safeguarding in its guidance on searching, screening and confiscation, and for police guidance on strip-searching children to clearly outline the need for a focus on safeguarding.\n\nThe review found that school staff deferred to the police\u2019s authority and \u201cshould have been more challenging\u201d and all staff members involved remain in post, The Independent understands.\n\nCondemnation of the school and police has been swift from concerned members of the public, campaigners and politicians.\n\nA Black Lives Matter UK spokesperson said the review\u2019s recommendations will not prevent similar incidents happening again.\n\n\u201cIt is a consistent practice of the police to violate and assault Black people \u2013 including Black children. This is their modus operandi,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe horrific strip search of a Black girl at school is a clear example of why police should not be in places of education. While politicians have recently called for more police officers to be stationed in schools across the capital, children are being traumatised in spaces that should be safe,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWith each story of degradation and brutality towards Black people at the hands of police, our resolve to abolish this violent institution only becomes stronger. Abolition makes the case for itself.\u201d\n\nEbinehita Iyere, founder of Milk Honey Bees, told The Independent: \u201cFrom a structural level, Black girls are being let down. They are criminalised through the British education system and the case of Child Q has further amplified that reality.\n\n\u201cMany Black girls will read, hear or have experienced things similar to her case. For too long, they have been overlooked and erased by state institutions, creating a situation that renders their childhood as invisible, further adultifying and exposing them to harm. Through Milk Honey Bees, I help to create a safe, nurturing space for our girls.\n\n\u201cSociety must listen to and protect Black girls. We need to create change within our systems, but this means that Black girls need to be on every agenda to ensure the erasure that has taken place is eradicated.\u201d\n\nAfrican, Caribbean and Asian Lawyers 4 Justice, a campaigning group of lawyers and judicial experts, said that Child Q\u2019s family may wish to consider a number of legal courses of action for equalities, safeguarding and human rights breaches, for example under Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThere may be grounds for a civil claim against the police and potentially Judicial Review regarding action on the school and local authority for unlawful actions, they added.\n\nZita Holbourne of the collective told The Independent: \u201cOur thoughts are with Child Q and their family and we send our solidarity for justice and healing from the trauma experienced.\n\n\u201cThis situation is horrific on multiple grounds and a number of institutions are answerable and accountable including the police, school, local authority and the Department of Education.\u201d",
