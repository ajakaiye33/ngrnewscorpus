          "title": "Full text of Ikpeazu\u2019s broadcast on 30th anniversary of Abia State",
          "text": "Governor Okezie Ikpeazu\n\nSTATE BROADCAST BY OKEZIE VICTOR IKPEAZU, Phd, GOVERNOR, ABIA STATE ON THE OCCASION OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF ABIA STATE ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 27, 2021\n\n\n\nMY GOOD PEOPLE OF ABIA STATE\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to address you today on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the creation of our dearly beloved Abia State.\n\n\n\nYou will agree with me that 30 is a landmark age for a State and it is for this reason that we have rolled out the drums with a series of activities to mark the anniversary of the creation of our State.\n\nOur founding fathers had lofty ambitions for us; from the push for the creation of our state even up until this day. I make bold to state that we have surpassed even their own expectations in a lot of areas.\n\nAgainst all odds, we have remained a strong, united people. At creation, we assumed the sobriquet of God\u2019s own State and it is very obvious that the hand of God has been upon our State at every turn. We have faced multiple challenges but at every critical moment, God has intervened to steady the ship of state and for that, we return all the glory to God.\n\nI am saddened that within the period we were gearing up to celebrate our anniversary, we lost 2 very important amazons from the state within a 24 hour window. First, we lost Lady Adanma Okpara, the wife of the former Premier of the Eastern Region and our venerated founding father, Chief Michael Iheonukara Opkara.\n\n\n\nLady Adanma Okpara, together with her iconic late husband, served the people of the old Eastern Region from 1959 to 1966 and together, they gave us a first class government whose achievements continue to reverberate even till this day.\n\n\n\n24 hours after the news of the demise of Lady Adanma Okpara, we were again, hit with the news of the passage of Noble Lady Victoria Aguiyi Ironsi, wife of the late first military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Gen. Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi-Ironsi.\n\n\n\nGeneral Aguiyi-Ironsi was a man of many firsts who took up the leadership of Nigeria at a very challenging time and paid the ultimate price in the service of his country.\n\nSince his death in 1966, his widow, the now late Noble Lady Victoria Aguiyi-Ironsi, bore her fate with equanimity and continued to be a strong voice for the entrenchment of an egalitarian society.\n\n\n\nThe death of both Lady Adanma Okpara and Lady Victoria Aguiyi Ironsi has become for us, in this period, a clarion call for the rededication of our pursuits to memorable causes for which we will continue to be remembered fondly long after we have completed our tours of duty in service to our state and humanity.\n\n\n\nThe work done by the duo of General Aguiyi Ironsi and Dr M I Okpara in the areas of peace, unity and the use of agriculture as a tool for economic development continue to serve as guiding lights to our administration. As at today, we remain the most peaceful state in Nigeria in terms of sociopolitical stability and security of lives and property.\n\nWe remain fully committed to the pursuit of the ideals of peaceful coexistence as a key component of a strong sociopolitical environment.\n\n\n\nIn the area of agriculture, with revered reference to the memories of those great amazons and their spouses, permit me to inform us that Abia State under our noble watch has embarked on the proliferation of Cottage industries in the local government areas of our state. Today, we have completed palm kernel oil processing plants in Obingwa, Ugwunagbo, Umuahia North and Isiala Ngwa North. Two more will be ready before the end of November 2021. These 6 plants will be commissioned in December 2021.\n\n\n\nBy the time we establish these in all the 17 LGAs, and in addition to what we had done with the planting of over 4 million tenera seedlings of oil palm, we would have further deepened the legacies of M I POWER as an icon of agricultural revolution in Nigeria.\n\nI join all Abians to pray that the noble souls of these two great Abia women find rest in the bosom of our creator.\n\n\n\nMy Beloved Abians, I had earlier stated that we have remained firmly on course to place the State on the map of positive reckoning. Our administration, since we came on board in 2015, have built upon the foundations laid for us by our predecessors and we have taken great steps to continue to move the state towards its destined path of greatness.\n\n\n\nLet me at this juncture pay special tribute to all our founding fathers both departed and still with us. I pay special homage to the Abia State Advisory Council led by one of our founding fathers and living legends, Ezeogo Dr. Anaga Ezikpe and his ebullient team of revered elder statesmen for their tireless efforts in guiding us on the path of sustainable development and reminding us of the ethos upon which our state was founded.\n\nThis anniversary celebration therefore presents us with another opportunity to remind ourselves of who we are and the values that have brought us thus far. This anniversary is another opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the unity, peace, prosperity and greatness of our state. This anniversary presents us with the imperative to eschew such tendencies that tear at the seams of our unity and invites us to commit that in all we do, the greatness of Abia State will continue to be paramount in our objectives.\n\nNdi Abia Ndi Nwem, as you are all aware, our administration embarked on an aggressive rebranding effort to reposition our state as the undisputed MSME centre of excellence in the country and beyond and that drive, propelled by our Made in Aba Campaign, have been a roaring success.\n\n\n\nAside from the already well-established growth in the available opportunities to our producers as a direct result of the campaign, I am glad to announce to you that Abia State has become a net exporter of labour and manpower in the productive sector. Abia youths are now being directly engaged by footwear and garment industries all over the world to come over and strengthen their workforce.\n\nWe have reports of young Abians getting recruited from Abia State to work in shoe companies in the United Arab Emirates and Liberia while Emmanuel Paul, an Abia Tailor based in Aba has been recruited by a garment factory based in Qatar to come over and work in their factory diagnosing issues with their equipment and fixing same.\n\nOur \u2018Abia to the world Campaign\u2019 has recorded positive gains not just in terms of goods produced in Abia State and exported to the world but now, we are also the destination for the recruitment of critical skilled labour for the global productive ecosystem.\n\nThis feat did not come about by happenstance. It is a result of a deliberate, painstaking roadmap which we outlined at the beginning of our administration which we have diligently pursued to visible impacts.\n\n\n\nWe are applying the same methods and processes to other sectors of our State economy. From education to healthcare, agriculture, industrialization, youth and sports development to critical infrastructural development and even social development, we have all hands on deck working to build the Abia we want.\n\nPEACE AND SECURITY\n\nLike I noted earlier, let me reaffirm at this juncture that the peace, security, unity and progress of Abia State will continue to serve as the watchword of this administration and we are committed, more than ever, to bequeath an Abia State that we will all be proud of.\n\n\n\nBeloved Abians, we are all witnesses to the times we are in as regards the security situation in the country. While the challenge has seemed intractable nationwide leading to wanton deaths and destruction, I must give glory to God that we have been able to keep crises and challenges under control in Abia State. A recent well-researched index of safety among states in Nigeria, placed Abia State as the state with the second least reports of violent insecurity incidences in the first half of 2021. We are mindful of our challenges and we have brought all hands on deck to work with us to continue to keep the state and its citizens and residents safe.\n\n\n\nWe are all also aware of the attempts by certain elements in Abia State to affect our commercial activities and other endeavours on a weekly basis. As your leader and Governor, I am making a passionate appeal to Abians to eschew these self-harming tendencies and resume normal activities on a regular basis.\n\nThe Abia State Government have put all modalities in place to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of all Abians and residents of Abia State on a daily basis and it is imperative that we do not cut our noses to spite our faces. While we do not begrudge any group their right to engage in lawful activities to press their claims, we would like to appeal to Abians not to fall for actions and activities that hurt their own economic aspirations.\n\nWe are the greatest losers in any activity designed to deprive our people of economic and social freedom and we must rise above tendencies that seek to hurt our legitimate pursuits.\n\n\n\nOnce again, I implore us all to resume our normal economic and social activities without fear of victimization while assuring us all that the Abia State Government have put modalities in place in conjunction with security agencies to ensure the safety and security of everyone going about their legitimate endeavours.\n\nROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nAs is often the case with developmental pursuits, we have certain areas where we are aware that more work needs to be done and we are dedicated to the task before us. We are faced with a huge deficit of critical infrastructure in Abia State and we are leaving no stone unturned to close those deficits.\n\n\n\nIt is for this reason that our administration has completed and delivered 128 roads across Abia State while remaining active on another 51 roads. As I have assured at different fora, we are committed to completing all the projects begun by this administration and we will endeavour not to leave any uncompleted project for the next administration.\n\nWe will remain on site, working for Abians to the very last day of our administration and we will bequeath a State that you will all be proud of. Our insistence on delivering roads that will stand the test of time and with sustainable drainage systems remain irrevocable.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nWe have continued to make progress in the education sector by way of a constant and well structured system of retraining of our teachers. This has produced huge effects on the productivity of our teachers. Coupled with our deployment of digital learning platforms, construction of over 600 classroom blocks, introduction of vocational educational programs like Education For Employment, our homegrown school feeding program, the results have been outstanding.\n\n\n\nOur public schools enrolment has moved from 150,000 in 2015 to 650,000 in 2020. We are looking forward to an increase in this number by the time we conclude our enumeration for this academic session. As at today, Abia is the second-best in school enrolment in Nigeria. We have consistently taken the lead in WAEC examinations for the last four years while our State University has moved up in ranking from No. 99 to No. 26 and is now the second-best State University in Nigeria.\n\nLet me, therefore, as the leader and the one on whose desk all the buck stops, convey my empathies to all Abians who have suffered and are suffering any form of discomfort as a result of our not yet having addressed the challenges in your sector. I pledge my dedication to working assiduously to ensure that all challenges affecting your sector is addressed and resolved. I have remained an open and transparent leader, acknowledging grievances and working with all concerned to resolve them. Our administration will continue to engage in collective approach to problem-solving and I call on all concerned to continue to work with us as we build the Abia of our collective aspirations.\n\n\n\nI will shortly be convening a Summit of the youths of Abia State from all over the world where we will hold a retreat with them to hear from them, their aspirations for Abia State for inclusion in our plans and policy formulations. It is my view that the youths are a critical component in the shaping of the Abia we want and I am therefore creating this opportunity to brainstorm with the youths and incorporate their aspirations in our plans going forward.\n\n\n\nAs you all know, Abia State recently concluded work on her 30-year development plan to guide our actions and objectives for the state for the next 30 years. The plan document, which I shall be unveiling later in the day at the Michael Okpara Auditorium, is a product of dedicated research and consultation, guided by development experts and encapsulating the wishes of Abians as gleaned from town hall meetings held across demographics all around the state.\n\n\n\nWhile building today, we are deliberate about proper planning and working towards a set goal and it is for that reason that I invite all policy-makers and officials of government to thoroughly study that document and tailor their work plans along the lines of the objectives set out in the document.\n\nMy dear Abians, as we mark 30years of our journey into statehood, let me once again invite us to rededicate ourselves to the aspirations of our founding fathers. As has been boldly proclaimed in our State anthem and official logo, we are the land of grace and faith. We are a people, dedicated to prosperity through enterprise. We are a people, created on equity and together, we must continue to stand united and collectively build the state of our vision.\n\n\n\nIt is on this note that I will like to once again, sound a note of warning to the diverse groups that have been promoting ethnic divisions and confrontational rhetorics in the name of positioning to take over power during the next election cycle. I remain firmly in charge of the governance of Abia State until May 29, 2023 according to the dictates of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which I swore to uphold. I therefore once again, wish to sound a note of warning that our administration will not condone statements and activities that are inimical to the unity and cohesion of Abia State.\n\n\n\nWhile we understand that agitations and positioning are the usual processes of politicking, especially leading up to a general election, we insist that such activities be carried out under the atmosphere of unity and inclusion. Power belongs to God and when the time comes, God will choose leaders he has predestined for Abia State. No individual or group aspiration is worth more than the unity of Abia State and we will henceforth, decisively deal with any individual or group fanning the embers of disunity and disharmony in Abia State.\n\n\n\nI call on Abians to continue to uphold their leaders in prayers for God\u2019s guidance and strengthening. I invite Abians to join us on a journey of assured shared prosperity. I assure Abians that we are firmly on course towards the building of the Abia we want. God has been faithful to us. We have a lot to be thankful to God for and we will continue to work to give you more reasons to celebrate.\n\n\n\nOur interventions in various critical sectors are yielding positive fruits. We are building on the legacies of our illustrious founding fathers and we are making steady progress. The future of Abia State is secured in the pantheon of economically and socially progressive states and I am once again, grateful to you all for the privilege of steering the ship of Abia State at this memorable epoch.\n\n\n\nI, therefore, invite you to join me as we toast to 30 years of Abia State with a firm belief that the next 30 years of Abia State will be a journey in progress, development and collective upliftment.\n\nONYE KWE, CHI YA EKWE!\n\nGod bless our founding fathers\n\nGod bless Abia State\n\nHappy 30th Anniversary Ndi nwem.\n\nOkezie Ikpeazu, PhD\n\nGovernor of Abia State.",

          "text": "By: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nRetired Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi, an Intelligence Officer and former Deputy Defence Adviser in Paris, France, who on Thursday revealed that that Boko Haram terrorists who had been arrested and interrogated mentioned names of some current serving Governors, Senators and Aso Rock officials as sponsors, was denied promotion to the enviable rank of Rear Admiral in the Nigerian Navy despite the fact that he was the most qualified at sone point.\n\nVanguard\u2019s Investigation revealed that the Senior Officer was recommended for promotion board interview on three different occasions during the tenure of former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ete-Ibas, and on the three occasions, his name was dropped by the Ibas administration.\n\nAccording to investigations, Commodore Olawunmi who was commissioned into the Nigerian Navy through the Onura entry Course 4, was appointed Deputy Defence Adviser during the tenure of Vice Admiral GA Adekeye (Rtd) as Chief of the Naval Staff.\n\nA source told Vanguard that serving as a Defence Adviser or a Deputy Defence Adviser in a Foreign Country is a Special privilege for Military Officers, an appointment which only about 3% of officers enjoy in their carreer.\n\n\u201cIn that regard, Commodore Olawunmi can be counted as one of few privileged officers in the Nigerian Navy at the period when Vice Admiral Adekeye held sway as CNS\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaving been presented for promotion three consecutive times during the tenure of the immediate past CNS and was rejected on each occasion despite at least on one occasion where he topped the list and being the only PhD holder, can be very frustrating especially when those who eventually got the promotions were not better, considering all the criteria\u201d a source said.\n\nAside the fact that he missed promotion on three occasions which eventually led to his retirement, Sources said the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s sanctioning of his being denied promotion, as the final decision emanated from his table, \u2018may\u2019 have elicited some grieviances from the officer\n\n\u201cMany of his colleagues, both seniors and junior officers believed he deserved to be promoted before he was retired in 2016 by the former CNS having exhausted his 3 chances for promotion to rank of Rear Admiral\u201d.\n\nA source said,\u201dBefore leaving service Commodre Olawunmi, a brilliant officer, never hid his disenchantment with the Nigerian Navy and in the CNS for denying him promotion he felt he deserved\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think the former CNS, Vice Admiral Ibas should be blamed for not promoting such a brilliant officer because the buck stops on the table on Mr. President, Muhammadu Buhari. Efforts would have been made to find out why such an excellent officer was being treated shabbily\u201d.\n\nAnother source added, \u201cRetired Commodore Olawunmi allowed his disgruntlement with the Nigerian Navy to boil over. He may have been treated shabbily by the Navy under CNS Ibas but certainly he is not the only person to have suffered such.\n\n\u201cBut it is unfortunate that as a retired senior military officer reduced all Nigeria\u2019s security problems from insurgency to banditry to kidnapping, to a conspiracy theory of a plan to islamize Nigeria, introduce Sharia and taliibanize the country.\n\n\u201cOne thing about serving in the military is that it reduces one\u2019s biases and bigotry. Even if it doesn\u2019t cure you of it completely, you would come out more balanced, more tolerant of others\u201d.\n\n\u201cCNS Adekeye made him Deputy Defense Adviser, France and he also had foreign stints in Angola and Niger. Not all officers get such opportunities. Consequently, one can say in sum that Commodore Olawunmi saw both the good and the bad of military service. There are some like him who do not benefit from such military experience\u201d.\n\nRecall that Commodore Olawunmi during a Channels TV interraction on Thursday morning made some very weighty pronouncements, which were seen as disturbing and dangerous and described as disappointing for one who has worn the military uniform.\n\n\n\nHe alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government failed to demonstrate the necessary political will to go after the high-profile politicians for reasons best known to it adding that it was an aberration by bandits to have attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy, NDA, where two military officers were killed and another kidnapped.\n\n\u201cIt is an aberration; you don\u2019t attack the Nigerian Defence Academy and get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe lamented a situation where like the NDA, other military environments in the country, carelessly open their doors to everyone on Fridays for Jumat prayer saying, \u201cThat is the time the terrorists have to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religious and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\nOlawunmi, now a professor of Global Security Studies, said he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (rtd). noted that he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsors.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru Yar\u2019adua) basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including (Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru) that died.\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government, that we know them.\n\n\u2018\u2019That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\nOlawunmi said the government had not been able to prosecute the sponsors because it was allegedly partisan saying, \u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade going on?\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation actually conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cWhy should a government decide to cause this kind of embarrassment and insecurity to the sense of what happened yesterday (Tuesday at the NDA)?\u201d he queried, adding that terrorist financiers want to turn Nigeria to Taliban type of country.\u2019\u2019\n\nOlawunmi also said the Department of State Services (DSS) has tremendous information on terrorists but they can\u2019t do anything except the body language of the President.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The current 7th Abia State House of Assembly led by the Speaker, Rt. Hon Chinedum Enyinnaya Orji has reeled out its achievements in enhancing the development of Abia State as its 30 years of her creation.\n\nDAILY POST also reported that the Abia state government had lined up activities to mark the auspicious anniversary of the creation of the state.\n\nIn a statement containing the gains of the current State House of Assembly towards achieving a greater Abia in the last 30 years, issued to journalists in Umuahia, on Friday, the House under Rt. Hon Chinedum Orji disclosed that it had passed impactful motions and made sound laws that have ushered economic and Infrastructural development in the state.\n\nSuch bills passed into law include the Abia State House of Assembly Service Commission Law, the Abia State Violence Against Persons Prohibition Law, the Abia State Donor Agency Trust Fund Law, The Abia State 2020 Appropriation Law.\n\nThe Abia State Security Fund (ASSF) Law, the Abians in Diaspora Commission Law, The Abia State Water & Sewage Development Law.\n\nThe Abia State of Nigeria Supplementary Appropriation Law 2020, the Abia State of Nigeria 2021 Appropriation Law and Abia State Audit Law.\n\nIt emphasised that Abia State House of Assembly was one of the few states that have passed the State House of Assembly Service Commission Law.\n\nAccording to the Abia hallowed chamber, It also remains the only State House of Assembly to date that has passed the Diaspora Commission Law for which even the Presidency commended them severally.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThese feats have been achieved within the short period of time the House has had to work considering that 2020 was a year the world almost came to a standstill and activities put on hold. So, while the House was inaugurated two years ago, it has had only one year or even less to achieve the many feats it has recorded, given also that the nationwide strike action of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), Body of the civil servants working at State Houses of Assembly, had paralysed activities at the Houses for close to three months this year. Despite this, Members of the Abia State House of Assembly are not relenting in their commitment to the people as they keep on providing dividends of democracy in terms of sound people-oriented legislation and physical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFor example, the Speaker himself has embarked on the construction of nine mini-stadiums across his constituency and beyond. The stadiums which are at different levels of construction stage are located in Isieke community, St Stephen\u2019s Primary School, Umuahia, Ezeleke Community Primary School, Umuopara, Ubakala, Ikwuano, Olokoro, and Ohuhu communities respectively.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker has also at one time or the other, provided potable water, electricity transformers, renovation of schools, health centres and such other facilities to communities. Through his esteemed interventions, citizens of the State have been given employment in both public and private sectors; he has given start up capital/equipment to numerous MSMEs, organised health outreach, sponsored certificated ICT Training/empowerment programmes for youths, granted scholarships to indigent students, intervened in the provision of facilities to both primary and secondary schools among other dividends to the people.\n\n\u201cThe Abia Speaker\u2019s youth-focused and people-oriented programmes as this one keep empowering Abia youths and make them independent entrepreneurs, wealth creators and employers of labour thereby leading to a society of youths with less vices and greater prosperity. The good news is that this us just the first phase as more youths are set to benefit from the next phase that will be flagged off soon.\n\n\u201cWhile we hear of chaotic relationships between the Executive and the Legislature in other places, the synergy between the Executive and Legislative Arms of Governmemt in Abia State has been top notch and it rubs off positively on the people as the Governor\u2019s ever progressive actions are given accelerated legislative backings and consideration in order for him to deliver on his goals without any encumbrances, hence, in the history of our modern democracy, the Abia State House of Assembly passed the 2020 and 2021 Budgets in record time, making implementation possible right from January 1 of the concerned years, despite putting in painstaking efforts at ensuring they dot all the necessary i\u2019s and cross the appropriate t\u2019s\u201d.\n\nAbia Speaker berates EEDC over poor services",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nSultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, has raised the alarm that the security situation is worsening and urged President Muhammadu Buhari, to as a matter of urgency, convoke a dialogue meeting to discuss the peace and unity.\n\nSultan said the dialogue meeting would be attended by traditional, community and religious leaders, opinion leaders, people from political and business communities and other people that matter in the affairs of Nigeria, to deliberate on issues of rising insecurity across Nigeria.\n\nDelivering his remarks at the third quarterly meeting of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) in Abuja, the Sultan said the security situation has assumed an alarming and worrisome dimension and could consume more people if urgent steps are not taken to reverse the trend.\n\n\u201cThings are getting worse in Nigeria by the day, especially the security situation. Unfortunately, our military and intelligence agencies seem not to be doing enough to bring an end to the killings.\u201d\n\nHe charged security agencies to fish out the people causing the trouble across and prosecute them to serve as deterrent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we sit together and discuss the issues that concern this nation. Most times, we meet at NIREC, discuss issues and arrive at conclusion. Unfortunately, people would go about and be doing otherwise, particularly preaching hatred and violence. We must be truthful to one another. What is so difficult in the president organising a dialogue that would have in attendance impressive participation of the traditional rulers, opinion leaders, market leaders, elderstatesmen and every person that has something to contribute?\n\n\u201cIf such a meeting is eventually convoked, we should look ourselves eyeball-to-eyeball and tell ourselves the truth. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid of such conversation again because things are deteriorating. Dialogue is the best approach because whatever cannot be achieved through dialogue will remain unachieved with violence. It\u2019s time we rise up and look beyond ethnic and religious sentiments, and tell ourselves the truth that what is happening in Nigeria is not right and make suggestions on the way forward.\u201d\n\nCAN President, Dr. Samson Ayokunle, in his remarks, accused President Buhari of being sentimental and bias in his approach to the issue of security and governance. He made specific reference to the recent killings in Plateau, Nasarawa and Benue States, in which he claimed President Buhari chose react to some of the attacks and keep silence in others, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s double standard.\u201d\n\nBut the Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, assured that President Buhari was fully aware of insecurity situation in Nigeria and was committed to bringing it to an end.

Buhari stressed that NNPC\u2019s losses were reduced from N803 billion in 2018 to N1.7 billion in 2019.\n\nThis is just as the corporation yesterday attributed the historic profit it recorded in its 2020 Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the adoption of cost-cutting measures, which hit about 30 per cent in the last two years.\n\nHowever, president has directed the corporation\u2019s management to ensure timely publication of its audited accounts.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement quoted Buhari to have said the directive was in line with an earlier pledge by the federal government to publicly announce the financial position of NNPC.\n\nBuhari, who doubles as Minister of Petroleum Resources, disclosed that the profit was made possible by the prudent management of the country\u2019s resources.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cI am pleased to announce the declaration of Profit after Tax of N287 billion in year 2020 by the NNPC. This is sequel to the completion of the statutory annual audit exercise for year 2020.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC losses were reduced from N803 billion in year 2018 to N1.7 billion in year 2019 and the eventual declaration of net profit in year 2020 for the first time in its 44-year history.\n\n\u201cThis development is consistent with this administration\u2019s commitment to ensuring prudent management of resources and maximisation of value for the Nigerian people from their natural resources.\u201d\n\nThe president said to take NNPC to the next level, he had directed that all the financial statements of the corporation must be promptly released.\n\nHe congratulated the NNPC board for a job well done.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cI have further directed the NNPC to timely publish the audited financial statements in line with the requirements of the law and as follow-up to our commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability by public institutions.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the board, management and staff of the corporation and look forward to greater value creation for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nFor the first time since its establishment, NNPC, in June and October, respectively, last year, made public its Audited Financial Statement (AFS) for 2018 and 2019. It noted in the documents that were released five months apart that it had achieved a 99.7 per cent reduction in its loss profile from a whopping N803 billion in 2018 to N1.7 billion in 2019.\n\nAlthough, a number of the corporation\u2019s over 20 subsidiaries recorded losses, the general administrative expenses of the national oil company witnessed a 22 per cent decrease, from N894 billion in 2018 to N696 billion in 2019.\n\nSome of the corporation\u2019s subsidiaries, which posted improved performance in its last audited results, included the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited (NPDC), which recorded N479 billion profit in 2019, compared to N179 billion in 2018, representing a 167 per cent increase. In addition, the Integrated Data Sciences Limited (IDSL) recorded a N23 billion profit in 2019, compared to N154 million in 2018, representing over 14,966 per cent increase, while the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) recorded N14.2 billion profit in 2019, compared to N9.3 billion in 2018, representing 52 per cent increase.\n\nNNPC Explains How Feat Was Achieved\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC has attributed the N287 billion profit recorded to its adoption of cost-cutting measures.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, told journalists at the headquarters of the company in Abuja that the national oil company had adopted drastic changes in the way its business was conducted before now.\n\nKyari, who spoke alongside board members of the corporation, who were also joined virtually by the Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, explained that the efforts of the corporation to embrace transparency and accountability encouraged by President Buhari, had started paying off.\n\nThe GMD said he attempted to bring in a new perspective in the running of the national oil company and built on what he met, ensuring more efficiency by automating the company\u2019s processes and systems as well as choosing wisely what to invest in.\n\nAdded to those factors, the NNPC boss stated that the corporation had also been focusing on staff welfare, saying happy workers would ultimately deliver on the objectives of the company.\n\n\u201cThe first principle of course is elimination, that is, you don\u2019t buy what you don\u2019t need. And we simply stopped buying what we didn\u2019t need. Also, during the particular fiscal year 2020, whoever we engaged on all our contracts, we insisted on cutting costs by at least 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis worked and we were able to pull down most of our procurement costs by 30 per cent. We saw the opportunity to be much more efficient by automating our systems and processes and that made us faster and also ultimately it reduced so much of logistics costs that ordinarily would have been additional costs to our business,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe admitted that although there\u2019s more work to be done, he remained proud of his team at the corporation, maintaining that history had been made by the NNPC.\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has now turned the corner from being a loss- making business that would look to improve on its performance especially under the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\n\u201cThis is a very proud moment for us, because to our shareholders we\u2019re no longer declaring losses. As a matter of fact, just like last year as we moved from loss level of N803 billion in 2018, we reduced it to N1.7 billion in 2019.\n\n\u201cAnd in the 2020 fiscal year, we\u2019re making profit after tax of N287 billion. This is no doubt a huge progress, but by no means sufficient,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the changes made by the corporation, he said: \u201cThere are very drastic changes to the way we do our business. One is to cut cost, to be more efficient, and also to ensure that this company is transparent and accountable to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sylva praised the NNPC board and management over the feat.\n\nHe listed other similar achievements in the last few months as the passage of the PIA and the historic publication of the NNPC 2018 and 2019 accounts last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari has said the PIA had replaced some regulations enacted in 1969, which were already archaic. Kyari said the oil and gas industry was in a bad state before now.\n\nThe GMD, who spoke on a national television programme yesterday, credited the success of the new law to a clement legislative environment, which had aligned with the executive arm of government.\n\nKyari stated that because of the fiscal uncertainty that made the environment uncompetitive, of the about $50 billion new investments in the oil and gas, which came into sub-Saharan Africa in the last five years, only $3 billion came into Nigeria. He said investors were not sure what would happen if they brought their money to invest in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is absolutely a new opportunity for the NNPC and its subsidiaries, because, henceforth, they have to justify their existence, as there will not be any patronage from the government or access to the resources of the state,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyari argued that the energy transition did not mean that the world was eliminating crude oil completely, but projects would be done in such a way that carbon effects on the environment would be reduced close to zero.\n\n\u201cWhat the PIA is trying to do is to make Nigeria a much more attractive and clement business environment for people to put their monies into, while focusing on the development of gas in the domestic and the spot markets,\u201d he maintained.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman, who also spoke on the corporation\u2019s acquisition of 20 per cent in Dangote Refinery, further reduced the timeframe within which to recoup its about $2.7 billion investment from five years to about three years.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat I see is that there are a lot of misunderstanding around the NNPC proposed acquisition of 20 per cent of equity in Dangote Refinery. What is not obvious is that, first, the Dangote Group does not want the NNPC to take this equity.\n\n\u201cBut the NNPC is just jumping in to take this equity. Again, no resource-dependent country, like Nigeria, will agree to allow such monumental project, with energy security implications, which has connection with fiscal security, to take place without having a seat on its board.\n\n\u201cRefinery is a very lucrative business. The government believes it can recoup its money within three years. Nobody is going to take government money to put into this project if not for the fact that it will benefit the people.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Raises contribution to joint account in July by N20bn\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is once more set to deduct about N215.3 billion from its contribution to next month\u2019s joint Federation Account.\n\nThe aforementioned amount is a combination of N175 billion value shortfall or subsidy and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nIn a document obtained by THISDAY yesterday detailing the national oil company\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting which held between 18th and 19th of August, the data showed that NNPC paid N67.280 billion to the joint account in July, in contrast to the N47.162 billion in June. The July payment was about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, net revenue to FAAC was N90.8 billion; N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March. Also, it was zero in April; N38.608 billion in May; N47.162 billion in June and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nYear-to-date, the document showed that the NNPC has only been able to make a contribution of N349.254 billion to the three tiers of government with a huge deficit of N1.115 trillion.\n\nBut added to JV cost recovery and priority projects, the document revealed that total distribution made by the corporation in January was N195.624 billion; it was N191.194 billion in February, and it hit N224.589 billion in March. Additionally, it decreased to N156.366 billion in April, but again rose to N320.315 billion in May and was N295.396 billion and N270.405 billion in June and July respectively.\n\nOverall, NNPC\u2019s crude oil lifting of 8.66 million barrels (export and domestic crude) in the month recorded 19.84 per cent decrease relative to the 11.58 million barrels lifted the previous month.\n\nIn the same vein, the NNPC presentation to the joint committee showed that Nigeria maintained 1.554 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut during the month.\n\nCrude oil export revenue received in July 2021 amounted to $12.95 million, equivalent to N4.97 billion, while domestic gas receipts in the month was N6.8 billion.\n\nIn addition Nigeria NLG (NLNG) feedstock was valued at $54.09 million during the period out of which $44 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\n\u201cOut of the value shortfall of N143, 286,281.752.62, the sum of N103.286.281, 752.62 was applied on the gross domestic receipts before arriving at the net receipt of N67.28 billion in order to make funds available for JV cost recovery to sustain the existing production level.\n\n\u201cThe balance of N40.000.000.000.00 will be deducted in subsequent months. The July, 2021 value shortfall of N175.317.701.294.80 and outstanding balance of N40,000.000,000.00 will be deductible from the August 2021 proceeds due for sharing at the September, 2021 FAAC meeting,\u201d the NNPC stated.\n\nLast month, the corporation continued its regime of deductions from the federation account withholding N117.4 billion from the three tiers of government.\n\nAt the time, the total subsidy retention on petrol since this year had hit a total of N608.808 billion since the full return of what the government terms under-recovery in February this year.\n\nIn June, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres, thereby worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. It later pivoted to a model similar to MaxAB\u2019s own, pulling out of Ivory Coast and Togo to focus on growing its network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco.\n\nThe acquisition will see MaxAB accelerate its expansion into the Maghreb market \u2013 Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 empowered by WaystoCap\u2019s expertise in the region.\n\nWaystoCap is the second African YC-backed company to exit over the past year after Paystack got acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last October.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take the food and grocery industry to another level in North Africa,\u201d Co-Founder and CEO at MaxAB, Belal El-Megharbel, said on the company\u2019s expansion and the synergies with WaystoCap.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this new super-team, combining a powerhouse of talent, technological know-how, on the ground infrastructure, boosted supply chains and WaystoCap\u2019s phenomenal experience of the region is very exciting.\u201d\n\nMaxAB\u2019s acquisition will now see more than 70,000 retailers supplied with essential food and groceries across multiple markets.\n\nNiama El Bassunie, CEO & Founder of WaystoCap who will take on the position of the managing director at MaxAB Morocco added: \u201cWe are thrilled to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team being created and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply.

          "text": "Ethiopia has begun developing its own social media platforms to rival Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Zoom, as per Reuters.\n\nAccording to the state communications security agency on Monday, the government wants its local platform to \u201creplace\u201d existing platforms, although it does not plan to block the other services.\n\nThe director-general of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), Shumete Gizaw has accused Facebook of deleting posts and user accounts that he said were \u201cdisseminating the true reality about Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nIn June, Facebook pulled down fake accounts targeting opposition figures ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives election, a move that didn\u2019t sit well with the incumbent Ethiopian government. In a local media outlet on Friday, Shumete accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has been criticized for shutting down access to internet and social media services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to unrest in the Tigray region and during the election. The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nSince November 2020, Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 115 million people, has been engulfed in a civil war between the federal government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the Tigray region in the country\u2019s north.\n\nSupporters of the different sides have taken the conversation over to social media.\n\nTo build these platforms, Ethiopia is relying solely on local expertise. While Shumete declined to share further details about its social media rival project, he proudly asserted that Ethiopia won\u2019t be the first to rely on local talents to build its social networks.\n\n\u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing such a parallel with the social messaging app WeChat is a bit troubling. WeChat, which is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings, is widely used in the country and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nAffected by the pandemic, the Ethiopian government has a lot on its plate as it works towards economic recovery. It\u2019s looking to raise money via sales of telecom licenses and obtaining an additional $1 billion debt.\n\nThis begs the question of whether investing in state-owned social network platforms should be on its list of priorities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2021, YouTube announced that it would start paying YouTube Shorts creators $10,000 monthly as a reward for creating exciting and engaging content. But they need to meet some requirements to be eligible for the Shorts Fund.\n\nIf Shorts is available in your country, then you\u2019ve passed the first eligibility test. So, what next? Well, your Shorts need to have high engagements. Depending on the number of views, creators can earn between $100 and $10,000.\n\nFurthermore, the videos need to be original; you cannot make a video on TikTok and post it on YouTube.\n\nOkay, now that we have those out of the way, here are six ways to make your Shorts more exciting and original:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Spice up your videos with music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nWhat\u2019s that saying about music being food for the soul again? Without background music, your Shorts might be boring. YouTube Shorts lets you add music to your content by tapping the Add Music icon at the centre of the top bar. It will take you to a music library that allows you to select one of the preset songs or songs by famous artistes. Interestingly, you can add audio from other YouTube videos to your Shorts. A list of most commonly used Shorts songs is available, meaning you\u2019re spoilt for choice.\n\nWhether your content is dull or cheerful, music is a great way to spice up your Shorts life.\n\n2. Add texts to your videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle tweaks can make enormous differences. Okay, proverbial sayings out of the way. One way to emphasise your points, spice up your videos, or pass your ideas across better is by adding texts to your Shorts content. You can add different text styles and modify them with varying colours, alignments, and widths, among other options.\n\n3. Import videos from your phone\u2019s gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho says you have to do a live recording? If there\u2019s a pre-recorded video you believe will be perfect for your Shorts, you can import it from your gallery. All you need to do is click on the gallery button at the bottom left corner of the record screen, select the video, edit with music or text, and then upload.\n\n4. Adjust video speed to suit your idea better\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nWho doesn\u2019t like some slo-mo or break-neck speed effect? Of course, what you use depends on what you\u2019re trying to achieve. YouTube Shorts lets you experiment with recording speed. With five possible speed options, you can generate slow-mo or speed-up effects by using the \u201cSpeed\u201d button.\n\n5. String multiple video clips together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know the saying \u201cthe more, the merrier\u201d? It\u2019s not just for owambe food and drinks; it can apply to your Shorts content too. The multi-segment camera on YouTube Shorts allows you to string multiple video clips together, eliminating the need for an external editor. All you need to do is release the record button while shooting to pause the video and resume recording when you push the button again.\n\n6. Make your video eye-catching with video filters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nFirst impressions matter in job interviews as much as they do in content creation. The way your content is presented matters as much, or dare I say, even more than your content. To make your videos more visually appealing, you can switch to varying filters in the recording and editing screens within the Shorts Camera. The filters also change the outlook of a video by colour-correcting footage and enhancing the look and feel.\n\nPeople often talk about the similarity between YouTube Shorts and video platforms like TikTok. But there\u2019s money to be made here, so let\u2019s stop the scrutiny for a moment and help creators build their content businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, YouTube Shorts launched in September 2020, allowing users to make catchy 60-second videos on their mobile phones. In May 2021, YouTube announced via a blog post that a $100 million Short Funds would be distributed to Shorts content creators whose videos receive massive engagements between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are in Nigeria and have a smartphone close by, let\u2019s do a little test. Spoiler Alert, we\u2019re borrowing a leaf from Tizeti\u2019s playbook, so try to keep up.\n\nGo to Speedtest.net on your browser and let it load for a few seconds.\n\nWhat speed do you see? 500 kbps? We\u2019re sorry about that. 2 Mbps? Well, pretty much standard. 50 Mbps? You\u2019re simply the boss. 100 Mbps? Speak the truth; you are not in Nigeria.\n\nWhatever your results, they\u2019ll probably pale in comparison to what Tizeti has in store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf recent updates are anything to go by, the telecom startup is currently testing next-generation WiFi technology in Nigeria that, if successful, could deliver Internet speeds up to 1Gbps \u2014 over 30x Nigeria\u2019s average Internet speed.\n\nThis means if you subscribe to 1 Gb of data, you will use it up in just one second.\n\nTizeti CEO, Kendall Ananyi, and Ikenna Uche (CTO) revealed this at Tizeti\u2019s NextGen event, held on Wednesday, August 11, 2021. The event featured experts from startups like Kudi, Aella Credit, and industry heavyweights like Nokia and MainOne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTizeti CEO, Kendall Ananyi\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has apparently given Tizeti the green light to test the new technology which will be available to its customers all over the country.\n\nWhat is this new technology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort answer, WiGig or 60 GHz WiFi. Ananyi explains that the new speeds will be built on the WiGig infrastructure known as 60 GHz Wi-Fi, next-generation technology on par with 5G technology.\n\nCurrently, most WiFi devices (routers and transmitters) in homes or offices run on 2.4 GHz with the fastest reaching up to 7 GHz.\n\nNaturally, a lot of Internet service providers transmit on these lower frequencies across the globe, so it is more congested. The WiGig allows WiFi devices (routers) to access the 60GHz frequency, which is way less congested and can help transmit data at multi-gigabit per second speeds.\n\nBasic technical details\n\nThe WiGig frequency falls within the millimetre-wave (mmWave) spectrum that features frequencies between 30 GHz and 300 GHz. It is sandwiched between microwave frequencies (300 Mhz and 30 GHz) and infrared frequencies (300 GHz to 400 THz).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe mmWave is not without flaws, as its signals can easily be disrupted by rain, humidity, and other environmental factors. Consequently, mmWave signals can only extend for a few kilometres.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about real-world use cases. The mmWave is used for radio astronomy, remote sensing, automotive radars, military applications, imaging, and security screening.\n\nThis frequency allows for silky smooth, high-resolution video streaming/broadcast, autonomous vehicles, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many others for everyday use. By now, you may have guessed that the high-end 5G network is based on this technology.\n\nWhat\u2019s with the name?\n\nWiGig stands for Wireless Gigabit Alliance, an industry trade group founded in 2007 by Ali Sadri, a Senior Director for mmWave Advanced Technology Development & Standards at Intel. He later recruited people from top global companies like Apple, Huawei, Microsoft, Sony, Dell, Qualcomm, and Toshiba, among others, to the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nTheir idea was to create interconnected home entertainment and office devices like PCs, tablets, smartphones, TVs, and music systems, without using wires.\n\nAt the time, the WiGig was not certified, but it worked with the Wi-Fi Alliance \u2014 the body that owns the Wi-Fi trademark \u2014 to develop the technology to mitigate its weaknesses. The collaboration helped extend the WiGig range to cover entire homes but at slower speeds.\n\nIn 2013, the WiGig Alliance merged with the Wi-Fi Alliance, but the 60 GHz Wi-Fi retained the name WiGig.\n\nTizeti\u2019s CTO, Uche, says the company is bringing the speeds and benefits of 5G technology before it arrives in Nigeria.\n\nWhy is this relevant?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTizeti CTO, Ikenna Uche describing Tizeti\u2019s technology process before the pandemic\n\nThe increase in Nigeria\u2019s Internet speed needs to be commensurate with its digital economy expansion and growing demand for Internet services.\n\nPer Internet World\u2019s Stats\u2019 December 2020 report, Nigeria has a 73% Internet penetration rate with up to 154 million Internet subscriptions.\n\nInternet World\u2019s Stats expresses the number of Internet subscriptions as a percentage of the country\u2019s population. Since a person might have more than one Internet device, this does not necessarily present an accurate number of unique Internet users in the country.\n\nNonetheless, Uche corroborates a popular assertion that Internet users in Nigeria increased during the lockdown.\n\nHe maintains that before the lockdown, Tizeti was only able to offer 2 to 5 Mbps to its customers, but the pandemic\u2019s onset forced it to improve its overall infrastructure, which more than doubled its Internet speed, taking it as high as 10 to 20 Mbps.\n\nLast year, the company said it had delivered 100 terabytes worth of data in six years, but it has added up to 80 terabytes in just one year.\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria leave much to be desired, and even more so with an ever-increasing demand.\n\nAccording to Speedtest\u2019s Global Index, Nigeria\u2019s average Internet speed stands at 23.61 Mbps, making it 96th worldwide and 8th in Africa.\n\nHow soon could this be available?\n\nAnanyi reveals that the technology should be commercially available to Nigerians by November 2021 after the ongoing tests and demos.\n\nThis means Nigerians in Lagos, Ogun, Rivers, and Edo States \u2014 where Tizeti has a major presence \u2014 would be able to access it once it goes live. The company will also be expanding to Abuja, Ibadan, Kaduna, Kano, Warri/Asaba, Eket/Uyo, Onitsha, Aba, Enugu, and Calabar.\n\nWho can access it?\n\nAnanyi says that as of August 2021, Tizeti has up to two million users across Nigeria and Ghana, all of whom will have access to the new technology.\n\nHow much will it cost?\n\nAt the time of writing this, Tizeti had not revealed how much the WiGig would cost. You can check their current pricing here and scale things up to manage your expectations.\n\nAnanyi insists that prices will remain affordable, in keeping with the company\u2019s vision of providing fast, affordable, and reliable unlimited Internet.\n\nWhat else has Tizeti been up to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkin Jones, CEO of Aella, Eniola Campbell, Country Head, Nigeria, Nokia, Olubunmi Ogun, Deputy General Manager, MainOne, and Kendall Ananyi, CEO, Tizeti.\n\nSince launching in 2014 as Wifi.com.ng, Tizeti has witnessed steady growth by adopting a unique approach to its operations. While issues like epileptic power have plagued telecom operators, Tizeti uses solar energy to power most of its towers.\n\nIn 2017, the company got into US-based accelerator Y Combinator and raised a $2.1 million seed round soon after. Then followed the launch of Express Wi-Fi by Facebook, an Internet service targetting Nigeria\u2019s low-income earners.\n\nIn 2018, it raised a $3 million Series A to expand to other countries.

The initial amount is N2 billion; we are making available N2 billion for MSMEs in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we have a N165million fund, as part of the first tranche from the Edo State Government. It will be made available to small businesses, which are currently domiciled in our production hub. The money is to support and encourage them to grow their businesses. Edo State Government provided N1 billion, while BOI provided the other N1 billion, making it N2 billion, with an attractive interest rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBOI has the capacity and resources to support this kind of programme. We are also partnering with Konga, utilizing the opportunity to empower our youths in the state,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cFrom this N2 billion fund, we estimate that we can impact as many as 50,000 businesses in Edo State. We have other facilities with other institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This is a start-up fund, as we expect it to continue to grow: If you start with N50,000, now and when you do well tomorrow in your business, you will need N200,000.\n\nBorrowing is part of business, provided you continue to grow,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nObaseki said, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration remains committed to improving the livelihoods of the people and creating opportunities for the youths to thrive.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe have continued to create opportunities for Edo youths as our administration is open, transparent and competent in all we do. We urge Edo people to trust us, as all the opportunities that we present are real, and life-transforming for Edo people.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who reassured on the realization of the government\u2019s Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda, stated: \u201cWe needed information to transform the state. As such, we embarked on the collation of data through our youths with the Data for MEGA project.\n\nIn Oredo Local Government Area (LGA), we have 11,152 small and medium businesses. In Owan West LGA, we have 501 small and medium businesses; the same data were collated across the state.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, BOI, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, noted that \u201cin a quest to grow and develop MSME businesses in the country, BOI has resolved to continue to collaborate with existing enterprises, as well as reputable local and international partners.\n\n\u201cThe MSME fund is aimed at providing business loans to enterprises located within the state, while the second fund is the N165m Edo Production Hub Fund, financed by the Edo State Government.

          "text": "Catholic Bishops in Nigeria under the auspices of Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), have lamented the security situation in the country, noting that Nigeria is now one of the most terrorised countries globally.\n\nThe Bishops who spoke in a communique made available to journalists in Abuja by the National Director of Social Communications, Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, Abuja at the end of the second plenary of the Bishops\u2019 Conference, yesterday, also demanded thorough electoral reforms that must include electronic transmission of results.\n\nIn the Communique co-signed by the CBCN President, His Grace Archbishop Augustine Akubeze; and Secretary, Most Revd Camillus Umoh, the Catholic Bishops said that the government must be balanced and seen to be so in its response to the challenges of insecurity.\n\nWhile condemning the widespread attacks by bandits, they stated that \u201clife has never been so cheap, nor has Nigeria ever been at the stage we are now.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic bishops said it is clearly in the interest of the Federal Government, and of the entire nation, to ensure that the youths in all parts of the country are gainfully employed as a way of reducing the unrest.\n\n\u201cDeaths in the hands of kidnappers, killer herdsmen, bandits, terrorist groups have made Nigeria one of the most terrorized countries in the world. The abductions of school children present us with the prospects of a traumatized generation of young people,\u201d the communique said.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the efforts being made by the government to fight insecurity in the land. However, we stress that the government needs to show more strategic commitment and sincerity in this fight and take full responsibility for the present culture of violence and impunity in the country.\n\n\u201cWe urge government at all levels to provide the enabling environment that would make it possible for both the government and the private sector to create job opportunities for our teeming youth population. This would surely reduce the danger of insecurity and unrest.\u201d\n\nOn the agitation for self-determination by some socio-cultural groups, the Catholic prelates blamed the situation on bad governance, injustice, inequity, and unfairness in appointments and distribution of resources to parts of the country.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the rights of peoples to self-determination; yet we emphasize that the exercise of such rights must be within the confines of the rule of law. We urge the government to ensure a just and fair trial of the arrested key players in the struggles. To mismanage these cases is to trigger off further avoidable unrest.We reiterate that the struggle for the \u2018soul\u2019 of Nigeria, that is presently ongoing, will not be won by ethnic cleansing, nepotism, kidnapping and banditry but by love, fairness and equity, common good and patriotism,\u201d the Bishops said.\n\n\u201cWhile congratulating the Federal Government for enacting the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, the Bishops also advised that the Federal Government should address the genuine concerns of the people regarding some clauses in the Act.\u201d\n\nOn the politics and election reform, the CBCN stated that although the Catholic Church does not support any political party, it would back any government that prioritised the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cWe therefore state loud and clear that the recent voting by the National Assembly against electronic transmission of results of elections will create an opening for further manipulation of electoral votes and lay the foundation for more conflicts in future elections. We call on the National Assembly to reconsider its position in the light of world best practices,\u201d the communique added.",

I can\u2019t even call it chopper, it is a military flight because if it\u2019s not a military flight, ordinary chopper cannot just start shooting people.\u201d\n\nConfirming the incident, the officer-in-charge of the Nigeria Police Force (Marine Division) in Bonny, Solomon Adeniyi, a Superintendent of Police, said he received a report about the incident, adding that efforts were being made to get further details on the incident.\n\nAdeniyi stated that victims of the attack, were currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Okrika while the other survivors were conveyed to Bonny.\n\nEfforts made by our correspondent to get the reaction of authorities of the 115 Special Operations Group of the Nigerian Air Force in Port Harcourt proved abortive.\n\nAlso, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police, was yet to react to the incident as at the time of filing this report.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has welcomed Thursday\u2019s Q2 2021 report by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showing a third consecutive quarter of positive growth of Nigeria\u2019s economy, and the highest quarterly growth in GDP since 2014.\n\nThe report\n\nThe Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01% in Q2 2021 following 0.51% growth in Q1 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, the growth was an indication of the return of business and economic activity near levels seen prior to the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, the report showed that the real GDP grew at -0.79 percent in Q2 2021 compared to Q1 2021, reflecting a slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\nBuhari excited\n\nHe said: \u201cThis growth, which continues the progress of the preceding two quarters, is a continuing trend reflecting Nigeria\u2019s economic rebound following the COVID-19-induced contractions seen in Q1 and Q2 2020.\n\n\u201cThe non-oil sector is a significant contributor to the economic performance in Q2 2021 with growth of 6.74% in real terms, the fastest growth in the sector since the third quarter of 2014. The contribution of the non-oil sector to GDP increased from 91.07% in Q2 2020 to 92.58% in Q2 2021.\u201d\n\nHe commended managers of the economy for hard work and commitment, urging them to keep at it till the positive development \u201ctouches the lives and pockets of the average Nigerian.\u201d\n\nHe listed the main drivers of the Q2 2021 economic growth to include \u201cTrade, Information and Communication (mainly Telecommunications), Transportation, Electricity, Agriculture (Crop Production) and Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe service sector, specifically, recorded its strongest performance in more than a decade, growing at 9.27%.\n\n\u201cThese main growth drivers of this second quarter performance are reflective of the gains from easing restriction of movement locally and internationally, and the improvement in the business and economic environment compared to the same period in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe President notes the decline in real growth in the oil sector in Q2 2021, compared to a year ago. Oil production levels were at 1.62million barrels per day, compared to 1.67million barrels per day in Q2 2020. The lower production output as well as the volatility in oil prices since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, is responsible for the decline in performance of the oil sector.\u201d\n\nHe assured \u201cthat recent reforms and efforts like the conclusion of the Marginal Fields Bid Round, the renewed focus on gas development (including the NLNG Train 7 project, and various pipeline construction projects) as well as the passage and assent to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), are certain to attract new investment to the oil and gas sector, and create conditions for more robust levels of growth in the future.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying to note that the various policies of the administration, aimed at boosting agricultural production, improving the business environment, and investing massively in infrastructure, are beginning to yield fruit. Equally gratifying is the complementary news of the steady decline in the rate of inflation, over the last few months.\n\n\u201cThe positive effects of the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), which helped fast-track the country\u2019s exit from the COVID-induced recession of 2020, continue to be evident, as some of the sectors driving the Q2 2021 growth have benefited or are benefiting from government-led interventions.\n\n\u201cThe successful roll-out of vaccines and COVID-19 protocols has also helped to reduce pressures on the healthcare system and the need for a lockdown,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking to the future, the President assured Nigerians that \u201cthere is much to be optimistic about.\u201d\n\nHe also assured that the investments in agriculture and infrastructure will continue, as will on-going efforts to achieve a significant improvement in the security situation across the country.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that a more secure environment \u2013 which the security agencies are working hard to achieve \u2013 will spur and energize the shoots of economic progress being seen and felt in the country,\u201d the president further said.\n\nEconomy bouncing back \u2013 Expert\n\nIn a telephone conversation Thursday, an economist, Friday Efih said the GDP figures were an indication that life was slowly and steadily returning to the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the removal of the COVID-19 restriction and business activities, including foreign travels resuming fully, it was only a matter of time before the economy picked up.\n\n\u201cOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, the figures show an improvement albeit slower economic activities resulting in slower growth.\u201d\n\nEfih urged the government to address burning issues of insecurity, the hostile business environment and its various interventions as these would further boost business activities.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should as a matter of urgency address the issue of insecurity which has adversely affected the agric sector as many farmers are unable to access their farms.\n\n\u201cAlso, the government should ensure that they monitor the various intervention in order to get the desired result so that it would not be a case of billions of naira gone down the drain,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Last-ditch evacuation flights took off from Kabul airport on Friday, a day after twin suicide bombings on crowds trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan killed at least 85 people, including 13 US servicemen.\n\nThe bombings, claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group, injected further panic into the final days of an already frenzied US-led airlift.\n\nThe attacks targeted US forces but hit hardest the mass of people fearing life under the Taliban who converged on the airport in a desperate bid to board a flight out.\n\nAt least 72 people among the crowd were killed, as well as the 13 American troops, according to various authorities.\n\nBut with people searching for missing relatives in hospitals on Friday, there were fears the death toll would climb.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, under enormous pressure over his administration\u2019s handling of the Afghan crisis, vowed to punish those responsible.\n\n\u201cWe will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever Biden, determined to end two decades of war in Afghanistan and citing fears of more IS attacks, also insisted that he would stick to his August 31 deadline to end the airlift.\n\nOn Friday morning, some evacuation flights resumed with queues of people seen lining up on the tarmac but there were no more crowds near the sites of the blasts, according to AFP reporters.\n\nBritain and Spain announced their evacuation operations would end Friday, after Canada and Australia had already stopped their flights.\n\nMore than 100,000 people have been flown out of the country since the Taliban swept into power on August 15.\n\n\u2018More extreme\u2019\n\nThe Taliban have promised a softer brand of rule compared with their first stint in power, which ended in 2001 when the United States invaded because they gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda.\n\nBut many Afghans fear a repeat of their brutal interpretation of Islamic law, as well as violent retribution for working with foreign militaries, Western missions or the previous US-backed government.\n\nWestern allies have repeatedly warned the United States that it is impossible to get all at-risk Afghans out by Tuesday.\n\nThe Taliban have allowed US-led forces to conduct the airlift, while planning to finalise their own government as soon as the American troops left.\n\nBut the IS jihadists, bloody rivals of the Taliban with their own track record of barbaric attacks, were intent on capitalising on the chaos in Kabul.\n\nIn recent years, the Islamic State\u2019s Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.\n\nIt has massacred civilians at mosques, shrines, public squares and even hospitals.\n\n\u201cThese are people that are even more extreme than the Taliban and are basically at war with the Taliban. So it is a horribly complex situation,\u201d Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton said.\n\nTerror, devastation\n\nThe attackers targeted people trying to reach access gates at the airport, creating scenes of terror and devastation.\n\nImmediately after the blast, one man held a semi-conscious victim by the elbow, trying to stop his head from slipping beneath the surface of the murky water in a canal along the perimeter of the airport.\n\n\u201cI will never, ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas,\u201d said Milad, who was near the first blast with his wife and three children, told AFP.\n\nThe Italian NGO Emergency said the hospital it operates in Kabul had been overwhelmed by more than 60 casualties, 16 of whom were pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThe injured \u201ccould not speak, many were terrified, their eyes totally lost in emptiness, their gaze blank\u201d, the hospital\u2019s medical coordinator Alberto Zanin said in a post on the group\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n\u2018Bear responsibility\u2019\n\nThe attacks led to the worst single-day death toll for the US military in Afghanistan since 2011.\n\nA clearly shaken Biden went before TV cameras to address the American people, describing the killed US troops as heroes.\n\nAsked by a reporter if he bore any responsibility for the deaths, Biden said: \u201cI bear responsibility fundamentally for all that\u2019s happened of late.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban, which condemned the blasts, emphasised they happened in an area under US military control.\n\nThe attacks were also denounced around the world, with Britain describing them as barbaric and Germany as heinous.\n\nThe United Nations called an urgent meeting of the permanent members of the Security Council for Monday.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "President Joe Biden, his voice breaking with emotion, vowed on Thursday the United States would hunt down those responsible for twin explosions at the Kabul airport in Afghanistan and said he had asked the Pentagon to develop plans to strike back at them.\n\nBiden spoke hours after the blasts here killed at least 13 American troops and scores of civilians, the worst day of casualties for U.S. forces there in a decade.\n\nIslamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), an affiliate of militants who previously battled U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n\u201cWe will not forgive, we will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,\u201d Biden said in remarks at the White House.\n\nHe promised U.S. evacuations would continue.\n\n\u201cWe will not be deterred by terrorists, we will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuations,\u201d he said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris canceled her plan to campaign for California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsroom, who is facing a recall election on Sept. 14, on her way home from a trip to Asia, and will instead return to Washington, her staff said.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Biden was sticking to his Tuesday pullout target for withdrawing U.S. forces, saying he was doing so on the advice of military advisers concerned about more attacks.\n\nShe said Biden was working to get out every American who wanted out by the deadline. \u201cOur commitment to them does not end,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden said he had ordered U.S. military commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership, and facilities. \u201cWe will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden defended his handling of his most serious foreign policy crisis, saying ultimately it is his responsibility, while assigning some blame to his predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, for the 2020 agreement Trump negotiated with the Taliban.\n\nHe said he did not trust the Taliban but believed it was in the group\u2019s interest to let the evacuations continue.\n\nPsaki said the United States also had \u201can enormous amount of leverage\u201d \u2013 including economic leverage \u2013 over the Taliban, which are subject to U.S. and U.N. sanctions.\n\nThe Afghan government has also long relied on transfers of dollars from their central bank assets, many of which are held in the United States.

          "text": "U.S. forces helping to evacuate Afghans desperate to flee Taliban rule braced for more attacks on Friday after an Islamic State suicide bomber killed 85 people, including 13 U.S. soldiers outside the gates of Kabul airport.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to be prepared,\u201d he said, adding that some intelligence was being shared with the Taliban and that he believed \u201csome attacks have been thwarted by them.\u201d\n\nU.S. forces are racing to complete their withdrawal from Afghanistan by an Aug. 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden, who says the United States had long ago achieved its original rationale for invading the country in 2001: to root out al Qaeda militants and prevent a repeat of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.\n\nBiden said he had ordered the Pentagon to plan how to strike ISIS-K, the Islamic State affiliate that claimed responsibility.\n\n\u201cWe will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down here and make you pay,\u201d Biden said during televised comments from the White House.\n\nVideo taken after the attack showed corpses in a waste water canal by the airport fence, some being fished out and laid in heaps while wailing civilians searched for loved ones.\n\n\u201cI saw bodies and body parts flying in the air like a tornado blowing plastic bags,\u201d said one Afghan witness. \u201cThat little water flowing in the sewage canal had turned into blood.\u201d\n\nZubair, a 24 year-old civil engineer, said he was close to a suicide bomber who detonated explosives.\n\n\u201cMen, women and children were screaming. I saw many injured people \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 being loaded into private vehicles and taken toward the hospitals,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018CHAOTIC EVACUATION\u2019\n\nA U.S. Central Command spokesperson said 18 soldiers wounded in the attack were \u201cin the process of being aeromedically evacuated from Afghanistan on specially equipped C-17s with embarked surgical units\u201d.\n\nA Taliban official lamented the number of his members killed, saying they had lost more men that the Americans, but Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid later said no Taliban were killed in the twin blasts.\n\n\u201cThat part of the airport is under the direct control of U.S. forces so we weren\u2019t there,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nA NATO country diplomat in Kabul said all foreign forces were aiming to evacuate their citizens and embassy employees by Aug. 30.\n\nThe Taliban would tighten security around the airport, said the diplomat who declined to be identified.\n\n\u201cSecurity is their responsibility,\u201d the diplomat said, adding that the Taliban should investigate the Islamic State network.\n\nWestern countries fear that the Taliban, who once sheltered Osama bin Laden\u2019s al Qaeda, will allow Afghanistan to turn again into a haven for militants. The Taliban say they will not let the country be used by terrorists.\n\nISIS-K was initially confined to areas on the border with Pakistan but has established a second front in the north of the country. The Combating Terrorism Center at West Point says ISIS-K includes Pakistanis from other militant groups and Uzbek extremists in addition to Afghans.\n\n100,000 TAKEN OUT IN AIRLIFT\n\nThe United States would press on with evacuations despite the threat of further attacks, McKenzie said, noting that there were still about about 1,000 U.S. citizens in Afghanistan.\n\nThe pace of evacuation flights had accelerated on Friday and American passport holders had been allowed to enter the airport compound, said a Western security official stationed inside the airport.\n\nIn the past 12 days, Western countries have evacuated nearly 100,000 people. But they acknowledge that thousands will be left behind when the last U.S. troops leave at the end of the month.\n\nSeveral Western countries said the mass airlift of civilians was coming to an end and announced their last troops had left.\n\nThe American casualties in Thursday\u2019s attack were believed to be the most U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan in a single incident since 30 personnel died when a helicopter was shot down in 2011.\n\nThe U.S. deaths were the first in action in Afghanistan in 18 months, a fact likely to be cited by critics who accuse Biden of recklessly abandoning a stable and hard-won status quo by ordering an abrupt pullout.",
