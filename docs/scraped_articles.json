          "title": "Fresh $5.8bn loan: SERAP seeks FG\u2019S moratorium on borrowing",
          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to issue an immediate moratorium on borrowing by the Federal Government and the 36 states.\n\nSERAP stressed that the measure would address a systemic debt crisis, prevent retrogressive economic measures, and the disproportionately negative impact of unsustainable debt on the poor Nigerians.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps to FG: Explore options to bring down price of cooking gas\n\nThe request followed the recent approval by the National Assembly of President Buhari\u2019s request for a $5.8 billion loan and grant of $10 billion.\n\nPrevious approvals in 2021 alone include $8.3 bilion; \u20ac490million, and $6.1billion. The foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 states, and Federal Capital Territory reportedly stands at $37.9billion.\n\nIn an open letter dated December 18, 2021, by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cA moratorium on borrowing would create a temporary debt standstill, and free up fiscal space for investment in Nigerians\u2019 needs, as well as ensure sustainable economic and social recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cWithout a moratorium on borrowing, your government and many of the 36 states may be caught in a process driven mostly by creditors\u2019 needs. This will result in an exorbitant social cost for the marginalized and vulnerable sectors of the population.\n\n\u201cLong-term unsustainable debt can be a barrier to the government\u2019s ability to mobilize resources for human rights, and may lead to taxes and user fees that impact negatively on vulnerable and marginalised Nigerians.\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cSERAP is concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of the loans so far obtained, and opacity around the terms and conditions, including repayment details of these loans.\n\n\u201cWhile the National Assembly has asked for these details in future loan requests, it ought to have seen and assessed the terms and conditions of these loans before approving them, in line with its oversight responsibility under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended].\n\n\u201cIf not urgently addressed, the escalating borrowing and looming debt crisis would cripple the ability of both the Federal Government and the 36 states to deliver essential public services such as quality healthcare, education, and clean water to the most vulnerable and marginalised sectors of the population.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that governments\u2019 ability to protect human rights is inextricably related to the ability to spend needed resources. Growing debt burdens and debt repayment difficulties will have negative impacts on the ability of your government and many of the 36 states to fulfill the basic socio-economic rights of poor and vulnerable Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSustainable debt management by the Federal Government and state governments will contribute to mobilizing resources for human rights and essential public services, and promote a culture of responsible borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and many of the 36 states would seem to be in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress. According to reports, the Senate and House of Representatives recently approved the loans of $5,803,364,553.50 and a grant component of $10 million under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis followed previous approvals this year by the National Assembly of $16.2 (16,230,077,718) billion loan; \u20ac1 (1,020,000,000) million and a grant component of $125 million loan; $36.8 billion, \u20ac910 million loans, and a grant component of $10 million; $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans; $6.1 billion, $1.5 billion and 995 million loans; and $4(4,054,476,863), \u20ac710 million and grant component of $125 million.\n\n\u201cSeveral of the 36 states are also facing a debt crisis, and vicious debt cycles. According to the Debt Management Office, the foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory presently stands at $37.9 billion.\n\n\u201cThe loans from China alone amount to $3.59bn. According to the UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights, Nigeria faces debt service relative to tax revenues that exceed 20 per cent, with escalating social tensions linked to poverty and inequality.\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged Buhari \u201cto conduct a human rights assessment of the borrowing by governments since 1999 to address the dire consequences of unsustainable debts on people and communities across the country, and to ensure that borrowing at all levels of government considers the human rights impacts.\n\n\u201cAny such assessment should be conducted in harmony with existing safeguards and mechanisms in order to contribute to informed decision-making and to complement findings from a human rights perspective.\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to adopt effective measures to address transparency and accountability gaps in spending of loans, and the systemic and widespread corruption in ministries, departments and agencies, as documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would therefore be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government and the 36 states to comply with our requests.\u201d",

          "title": "All you need for healthy teeth is the banana peel!",
          "text": "Who doesn\u2019t want dazzling white teeth without spending a fortune at the dentist? Especially when you can spend next to nothing to get them sparkling white? Old wives\u2019 tales? Well, according to websites devoted to the unlikely fruits, spices and oils which promise to give you a knock-them-dead smile at a fraction of the price dentists charge.\n\nThis is not so far fetched. But as for Dr. Uchenna Okoye, a clinical director at London Smiling Dental Group, a bit of caution is advised before you make your teeth worse than they are. He then gives his opinion on the various \u2018wonder cure\u2019 for yellowing teeth.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps to probe tax compliance by Bolt, Uber operators\n\nStrawberries: Claim \u2013 Mash up a ripe strawberry, dip your toothbrush in it and brush carefully over teeth. Within two weeks, your teeth will be whiter.\n\nDentist\u2019s Verdict: True \u2013 Strawberries contain citric acid, which can weaken the surface hardness of your teeth. But it also contains the more gentle malic acid, and the riper the strawberry becomes, the higher the concentration of malic acid compared to the more harmful citric acid. So choose a really ripe strawberry, rub it on your teeth and just like exfoliating the skin, it does remove superficial debris. The malic acid won\u2019t actually break down the stain molecules, but the surface clean gives your teeth a whiter appearance. A gentle and effective natural whitener.\n\nOrange Pith: Claim \u2013 The white part of the orange skin, between the surface and the flesh of the fruit, contains a d-limene, which can help remove stains from your teeth after using it for three weeks. Peel the orange, keeping as much of the white pith as you can. Rub the white part of the peel over your teeth, and let the juice sit on your teeth for three to five minutes, Brush your teeth thoroughly to clean away pulp and peel, and after several weeks the chemical will have whitened the appearance.\n\nVerdict: False \u2013 The advice I give all my patients is to be very wary of fruit juices and drink them with a straw (if they have to drink juice at all). So this claim goes against every piece of advice and scientific evidence I can think of. The citric acid within the orange causes tooth enamel to dissolve. This erosion can lead to tooth decay, and once the erosion has reached the soft, inner layer of your teeth known as dentine, you\u2019ll experience sensitivity and pain. Avoid.\n\nBanana Peel: Claim \u2013 High levels of potassium, magnesium and manganese in bananas can help remove stains from teeth. Simply peel a ripe banana, and rub your teeth with the insides of the peel for about two minutes. After three weeks, your teeth will have whitened.\n\nVerdict: True \u2013 If you rub the skin, it can act as a gentle exfoliator and will remove some surface stains, but the banana will not reach the inside the pores on the surface of your enamel \u2013 so no true \u2018deep\u2019 clean will take place. However, I like the idea that you can eat a banana and give your teeth a quick healthy buff before running off to a meeting.\n\nCider Vinegar: Claim \u2013 Rinsing with apple cider vinegar (mixed two pints of water) will make teeth whiter and protect teeth and gums from bacteria.\n\nVerdict: False \u2013 Cider Vinegar is a favourite of \u2018detox\u2019 devotees. Once swallowed, it mixes with pancreatic secretions in the intestines and turns alkali e, but when it hits your teeth, it is an acid, albeit a weak one. This makes the enamel on your teeth less resistant to damage \u2013 like wetting a chalk and then scraping off the surface. A low acid level \u2013 such as the malic acid in strawberries \u2013 won\u2019t harm your teeth. But this will buff away a deeper layer of enamel, and should be avoided.\n\nCoconut Oil: Claim \u2013 A 3,000-year-old Ayurvedic way to clean teeth is to swish a tablespoon of oil (usually coconut, sesame or olive oil) around your mouth for 20 minutes every morning. The coconut oil sticks to the oil in the cell membrane of any bacteria in your mouth, so when you spit it out, you are ridding your mouth of unwanted micro-organisms. Used by stars including Gwyneth Paltrow, who claim it whitens teeth and improves complexion.\n\nVerdict: False \u2013 There is no scientific evidence at all that \u2018oil pulling\u2019 as it\u2019s called, will whiten teeth, or even remove bacteria. It\u2019s possible that the act of swishing the oil around your mouth will dislodge some bacteria or debris, so followed by a careful brushing session, your teeth may look cleaner. But no science shows that oil pulling will make your teeth any whiter.\n\nBicarbonate of Soda: Claim \u2013 Bicarbonate of soda is a mild abrasive which effectively removes stains on teeth caused by coffee, red wine and tea. In a cup, mix half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda with half a teaspoon of water, mix to form a paste, dip your toothbrush into the mixture and brush teeth for one to two minutes. After just a few days you will notice a difference.\n\nVerdict: True \u2013 Bicarbonate of soda \u2013 otherwise known as baking soda \u2013 is somehow considered natural but it is actually a chemical, and used commercially in some teeth \u2013 whitening products and tooth pastes. It does effectively remove plaque and debris in the surface of the teeth to make them appear brighter, and it also can neutralise bacterial/acids in the mouth. But it is an abrasive compound and, as such, will damage the enamel protecting the teeth if used too much. Try it three times a year to lift those surface stains, and to avoid damaging the enamel, use your finger to rub it on or a flannel.\n\nLemons: Claim \u2013 Suck on a slice of lemon for several minutes each morning, or rinse your mouth with lemon juice squeezed into a glass of water. The acid from the lemon will deep-clean even the tiniest of molecules lodged in your teeth.\n\nVerdict: False \u2013 Lemons have such a high concentration of citric acid that their juice is acidic enough to corrode enamel. Lemon juice has no place in the mouth at all. Lemons are more acidic than vinegar. Far from whitening your teeth, they\u2019ll dissolve them away. I have seen patients who used such lemons and are left with the imprint of a lemon slice on their teeth \u2013 requiring bonding and veneering to cover it up. Avoid this at all costs \u2013 it is the same as bathing your teeth in a glass of cola.\n\nSo which is best? Strawberries beat them all hands down!\n\nWhat you see is all you get! (Humour)\n\nDuring a wild weekend in Edinburge with the lads, Vinnie declares; \u2018I\u2019m going to wear a kilt out clubbing tonight.\u2019 The others laugh but Vinnie insists embracing the traditional costume will get him lots of female attention.\n\nThat night, Vinnie\u2019s kilt swishes around his bare knees as they swagger into a club. Immediately a beautiful woman sways up to him. \u2018Hey, handsome,\u2019 she says with a wink. \u2018Is there anything worn under that kilt?\u2019 \u2018Oh no,\u2019 Vinnie declares hastily. \u2018It\u2019s all in perfect working order.\u2019\n\nDo It Yourself! (Humour)\n\nOne night, Alex is in the mood to make love to his beautiful wife, Gail. Not wanting to sound too blunt, he whispers: \u2018Would it be OK for me to put my letter in your post box?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, it would not!\u2019 she fires back. An hour later he\u2019s still feeling frisky. \u2018Any chance of posting my letter in your post box now?\u2019 he murmurs. \u2018No! Go to sleep,\u2019 Gail replies firmly.\n\nBut as time ticks by, she relents and says huskily: \u2018OK, you can put your letter in my post box now\u2026\u2019 \u2018Forget it,\u2019 Alex snaps. \u2018It\u2019s been delivered by hand.\u2019",

According to the Debt Management Office, the foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory presently stands at $37.9bn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe loans from China alone amount to $3.59bn. According to the UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights, Nigeria faces debt service relative to tax revenues that exceed 20 per cent, with escalating social tensions linked to poverty and inequality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe growing level of borrowing by your government and the 36 states is clearly a human rights issue because when the entire country is burdened by unsustainable debts, there will be little money left to ensure access of poor and vulnerable Nigerians to basic public services.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it is critical for the Federal Government and state governments to have sufficient resources to fund their budgets, it is equally critical for governments to substantially cut the cost of governance. Persistent borrowing is neither sustainable nor fair to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to conduct a human rights assessment of the borrowing by governments since 1999 to address the dire consequences of unsustainable debts on people and communities across the country, and to ensure that borrowing at all levels of government considers the human rights impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny such assessment should be conducted in harmony with existing safeguards and mechanisms in order to contribute to informed decision-making and to complement findings from a human rights perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cA human rights impact analysis should serve to ascertain the debts that can be repaid, and the resources necessary to ensure compliance with the obligation of using the maximum available resources for the protection and fulfilment of human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted, States parties including Nigeria are under an obligation to devote their maximum available resources to the full realization of all economic and social rights, including the rights to health, education and water.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to adopt effective measures to address transparency and accountability gaps in spending of loans, and the systemic and widespread corruption in ministries, departments and agencies, as documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would therefore be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government and the 36 states to comply with our requests.\u201d",
          "summary": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201cissue an immediate moratorium on borrowing by the Federal Government and the 36 states to address a systemic debt crisis, prevent retrogressive economic measures, and the disproportionately negative impact of unsustainable debt on the poor Nigerians.\u201dThe request followed the recent approval by the National Assembly of President Buhari\u2019s request for a $5.8bn loan and grant of $10bn.\nPrevious approvals in 2021 alone include $8.3bn; \u20ac490m, and $6.1bn.\nThe foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 states, and Federal Capital Territory reportedly stands at $37.9bn.\nAccording to the Debt Management Office, the foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory presently stands at $37.9bn.\u201d\u201cThe loans from China alone amount to $3.59bn.\nIf we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government and the 36 states to comply with our requests.\u201d",

          "text": "AdvoKC, a youth-led civic tech organization has launched its digital platform to allow citizens hold elected political officers accountable for their camping promises months after election.\n\nThe digital platform dubbed \u2018Promise Meter\u2019 which launched on Saturday after months of beta testing on Substack was developed with the mission to address the gap between government officials and effective service delivery.\n\nExplaining the purpose of the \u2018Promise Meter\u2019 the group said in a statement released after the launch that \u201cIn Nigeria, voters are inspired to work for the candidate or political party whose campaign promises agree with their social, economic, and political needs. But are always disappointed when these promises are not kept.\n\nAdvoKC also also seeks to increase the rate of fulfilment of campaign promises among political office holders, the group said in the statement.\n\nHabib Sheidu, AdvoKC\u2019s Co-Founder/Research Lead, explained that the digital platform leverages on technology through its Data-Driven promise meters to articulate political promises which are made during political campaigns.\n\nHe said it uses different ratings such as \u201cIn the Works,\u201d \u201cCompromise,\u201d \u201cStalled,\u201d \u201cPromise Kept\u201d and \u201cPromise Broken.\u201d\n\nHabib said AdvoKC promise meter will show promise ratings for citizens to make informed decision during every election cycle.\n\nAbiola Durodola, AdvoKC\u2019s Co-Founder/Team Lead, while speaking said the model is not only focused on addressing transparency and accountability but also citizens engagement and participation in Nigeria as politicians use promises as a political strategy to garner vote during campaigns.\n\nHe added that a core mandate of the group is to address the issue of political elites in Nigeria exploiting poverty and illiteracy to mobilize voters with food items and money without delivering on their promises every election cycle.\n\nDuring the launch, the group announced the appointment of Serah Makka-Ugbabe, ONE Campaign Executive Director on Mobilisation as the Chairman of its Advisory Board. The team also announced the appointment of Dayo Ibitoye, Communication and Knowledge Management Specialist at World Bank; Olumide Abimbola, the Executive Director, Africa Policy Research Institute; Ms. Faith Nwadishi, Executive Director, CTA, and Dr. Aliyu Nuhu, a doctoral student at LSE into its Advisory Board.\n\nBeyond the \u2018Promise meter\u2019 the group noted that citizens can also access other features like Submit a Promise, Promise Reminder, Factcheck and Climate AdvoKC.",

          "text": "\u2018Monarch accused me of being too stingy with money\u2019\n\nAs governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande had problems with the immediate past Ooni of Ife, Oba Okuade Sijuwade, and the Owa-Obokun of Ijeshaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\nAkande, in his book, \u2018My Participations\u2019, said the late Sijuwade wanted him to plunge the state into debt by taking a loan for a water project the Oba had an\n\ninterest in.\n\nHe also said Oba Aromolaran was always saying bad things about him because of his belief that he was stingy.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that most of the obas did not want to associate with the Owa-Obokun, His Majesty, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\n\u201cOne day he came to me to complain that he had no car. I told him that Osun State had no money now to buy cars for traditional rulers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cBut his pestering was too much and I secretly sent money to him to buy a car.\n\n\u201cI went to meet him at his palace in Ilesha and told him that he should use the money I sent to buy a car. He then called Lere Adebayo.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know how much of the money he should return to me! Lere then told him, \u2018Don\u2019t try that with Akande o! Ajemonu tie niyen!!\u2019\n\n\u201cMaybe that was the practice before my time. A few weeks after that incident, the Commissioner of Police was changed and the new man was touring the state and when he got to Ilesha, the Owa called him aside.\n\n\u201cHe told the CP that the only person he should be careful of within the state was Governor Akande. \u2018He is too stingy with money,\u2019 Kabiyesi said. The Commissioner of Police reported to me.\n\n\u201cSo one day the Owa came again to report to me Mr Niran Fajuke, the chairman of the local government in Ilesha. He complained that Fajuke was not taking good care of him.\n\n\u201cI accused him, saying, \u2018Baba, you too are not sometimes a nice person. Even after I gave you money secretly to buy a car, you still told the new Commissioner of Police that I was dangerous and stingy!\u2019\n\n\u201cOn another day, I met Owa alongside Rauf Aregbesola in Bola Tinubu\u2019s house at Bourdillon and tried to warn Aregbesola to be careful with Owa Aromolaran. Among the Obas and chiefs, the Owa seemed unpopular,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Owa had a long-standing grudge against Ooni Sijuwade who wanted to dominate the entire space.\n\n\u201cOoni wanted to make an entourage of the smaller obas with a view to tormenting the Owa and other obas who might be opposed to him. He would give them money.\n\n\u201cWhat worried me with bringing the smaller obas into the Council of Obas to make them have an equal ranking with the other paramount rulers was that it might undermine the age-old tradition of the Yoruba people.\n\n\u201cAs far as my government was concerned, only three obas were paramount in Osun State: The Ooni, the Orangun and the Owa,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added that when his old boss at BP, the Ajalorunof Ijebu-Ife, Ogun State, wanted to honour him with the traditional title of Jagunmolu Oodua, the late Ooni opposed it.\n\n\u201cHe wrote him a letter insisting that he being the Arole Oodua, was the only one who could confer a title with the word \u2018Oodua\u2019 as part of its name.\n\n\u201cHe warned that if Oba Oguntayo should go ahead he would incur the wrath of the Yoruba deities. The Ajalorun wisely went ahead and I received the title. The Ajalorun has been waxing stronger since then.\n\n\u201cThe Ajalorun is one of the most ancient of Yoruba traditional thrones and like all other leading obas, the throne originated from the House of Oduduwa in lle-Ife.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ijebu-Ife is regarded as a replica of the old Ile-Ife. But the problem I had with the Ooni was more serious and graver and it also had to do with money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the late Ooni wanted him to renew the Ede-Osogbo Waterworks which was to be repaired with $300 million.\n\nHe refused to sanction the deal.",

What happened was very unfortunate!\u201d\n\nHe also relived how he heard of the incident: \u201cIn the evening of December 23, 2001, I returned from a trip to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI was met at the Murtala International Airport by a team of top officials from Osun State, including my Attorney General, Dr Yemi Adedeji and Sola Akinwumi, the SSG.\n\n\u201cI drove in my car with Akinwumi and we headed for Osogbo. We took the old road from Ibadan, passing Iwo to Osogbo.\n\n\u201cWe had passed Iwo and getting close to Osogbo when Akinwumi\u2019s phone rang. Muyiwa Ige was on the other end.\n\n\u201cAkinwumi was just shouting Ah! Ah! Ah!! Then, the line went off. \u2018Uncle Bola has been killed!\u2019 Akinwumi announced flatly when he finally gathered himself.\n\n\u201cI was in shock! I did not know what to do. For the second time in my life, I had suddenly become an orphan again.\n\n\u201cIge was more than a political mentor to me. He was my uncle, my friend, my confidant.\n\n\u201cHis loyalty was total and his love was deep and profound. For me, he was irreplaceable.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWhen we arrived at the Government House, I gathered my entourage together and broke the tragic news to them.\n\n\u201cThere was an uproar \u2013 groaning and moaning and general confusion. Someone suggested we should pray.\n\n\u201cWe bowed down our heads and prayed. By the time the prayer ended, I noticed that the Commissioner of Police was now with us.\n\n\u201cHe had walked into the centre gingerly and was now standing close to me. Before we greeted, his phone started ringing. He gave me the phone.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obasanjo on the other end.\n\nIt occurred to me that what concerned the President more was not to arrest the assassins of his friend, but to prevent social unrest and calm the nerves of the populace.\n\n\u201cI told him we would take all necessary measures to prevent a breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cI sent messages to traditional rulers and other leaders that night\u2026\u201d",

That didn\u2019t make me to have a change of opinion about Obasanjo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything genuine about him despite his self-glorification,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe claimed the ex-president\u2019s nationalism and patriotism were fake, adding that his ambition to be the centre of Nigeria\u2019s universe made him express constant hatred for the late Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIt was this vaunting ambition that made him express constant hatred to the most altruistic and selfless leader of our time, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cHe continues to wonder till tomorrow why the Yoruba people, especially after his tour of duty as a two-time President, continue to elevate Awolowo to the highest pedestal while they have no respect for him. So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor and Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\nAfenifere leader: I won\u2019t sue Akande\n\nOyinlola denies allegations\n\nAfenifere Acting Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has said he will not take former Osun State Governor Bisi Akande to court over his comments about him in his book, My Participations.\n\nBut the elder statesman denied that his Lekki house, which is a bone of contention between him and Akande, was built for him by the All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nAlso, Akande\u2019s predecessor, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who denied the allegations against him, alleged that Akande financed his 2003 re-election bid by collecting part-payment from the contractor building the Governor\u2019s Office.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOyinlola, who is also a former Lagos State military administrator, said he had warned Akande against creating a wedge between himself and his former deputy, Chief Iyiola Omisore.\n\nThe retired Brigadier-General said his own autobiography will answer Akande\u2019s allegations against him.\n\nAlso, Adebanjo told reporters in Lagos that three years ago, when he launched his book, titled: Saying It As It Is, Tinubu described him as an incorruptible person and man of great character.\n\nThe Afenifere leader urged the anti-graft agency to probe how Akande built his houses at Ila, his home town in Osun State, and Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo intention to sue. The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

So, we assigned a chalet to him at the Government House.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI attended the ceremony as a mark of honour to him. I thought I should encourage him to link up with us in Osun.\n\n\u201cI was encouraging him but did not know how to say it. First, his background was not Osun.\n\n\u201cSecond, a Commissioner for Works in Lagos controls a far bigger budget than the Governor of Osun State.\n\n\u201cBeing a native of our state, he could be thinking of doing something different in future.\n\n\u201cSo, I started introducing him to people and encouraging him to be part of us. That was how we linked up with Rauf Aregbesola,\u201d Akande recalled.\n\nWhen Omisore was impeached, he discussed with Tinubu about having Aregbesola as his deputy.\n\n\u201cHe promised to get back to me. We didn\u2019t see often and the phone was not efficient in those days.\n\n\u201cTinubu had something doing in Seattle, in the western coast of the United States where he was to be honoured by his old American school. He invited me.\n\n\u201cThe second or third day, Rauf appeared in my hotel room. He said Tinubu said I wanted to talk to him. I asked him to take a seat.\n\n\u201cI offered him the post of deputy governor which would be confirmed by the House of Assembly. Afterwards, I would be able to ease myself out.\n\n\u201cHe thanked me and said he would come back to me. Instead of him, it was Tinubu who came.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018That boy is shy and he didn\u2019t know how to put it.\u2019 Tinubu explained that Rauf was holding an important position for him in Alimosho local government politics and that he would still need him for mobilisation leading to the 2003 general elections.\n\n\u201cHe apologised that it would not be possible for him to release Rauf. He said I should look for someone else and after my second term, we would think of the next step,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe added that Tinubu said after the election, Aregbesola would come to learn more about Osun and its politics.\n\n\u201cSo, he chose Sooko Adewoyin, an elderly and experienced person from Ile Ife who was introduced to him by Prince Peter Ogunleye as his deputy.\n\n\u201cAt the appointed time, Rauf indeed came to Osun and he proved equal to the task, becoming the first Governor of Osun State to spend full two terms,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nNollywood actress, Ngozi Ezeh has been having her fair share of love advances from fans, as some of them kept flooding her with marriage proposals.\n\nIn this interview, the ever-smiling mother of three talks about how she copes with randy men. Excerpts:\n\nCan you recall the year you started acting?\n\nI started acting professionally in 2000. And then I had to withdraw a little to attend to the children, and now that they have fully grown, I had to come back.\n\nWhat was your first movie?\n\nMy first movie was titled, God Where Are You?\n\nLooking back, in terms of comparison, what would you say is different in the industry?\n\nBack in the days, you must know a producer or be in good terms with him, and then he would have to favour you by giving you a movie role. But now, your craft is being appreciated the more, if it\u2019s not good enough, you are going nowhere.\n\nWhat differentiates the social media acting from the real Nollywood acting?\n\nThen, the industry was centered only in the open market, but now you have different markets such as YouTube, Netflix etc., and different platforms where you can showcase your films and crafts.\n\nWhat good or harm would you say social media has done to the movie industry?\n\nSocial media has helped the movie industry in mitigating copyright and piracy. Social media has brought a lot of enlightenment to Nollywood and has showcased us and our platforms; while also providing a beautiful landing for our jobs.\n\nWhat project are you currently working on?\n\nI am working on a project directed by Ebizu. My character in the movie is Madam Veronica, a matron in the hospital and she wasn\u2019t privileged to have children. So, when the unfortunate couple that got stranded came to her to help deliver their baby, she helped quite alright, but ended up stealing one of the twin girls delivered.\n\nWho exactly is Ngozi Ezeh aside the one always acting the good role in movies?\n\nI am a pleasant and easy-going woman, and I believe what is fair is fair. That\u2019s my life. I am very straightforward; I like life when it is easy going. It costs little to do good and so much to do evil because you have a lot to contend with.\n\nYou rarely play bad character in movies, why?\n\nI do bad character in movies too, like I did in Royal Glory and Royal Wars, among others. My look doesn\u2019t really change anything, but they always make me play the emotional part because they feel I can cry easily, and that my face appears emotional. I wonder from where they got that.\n\nHow do you manage both your family and acting?\n\nThe kids are grown now; they are all in the university. When you build your life on transparency, it goes a long way to help you be and do whatever you want to do in your life. If you start early to build a trustworthy relationship with honesty, you would not need to worry about anything. And God is always there to guide us.\n\nWould you support any of your daughters to follow your footstep and be an actress?\n\nExcellently! Acting is a worthy profession, and as long as you know your onions, you have nothing to worry about.\n\nHas fame denied you of anything in life?\n\nNever.\n\nHow have you been able to manage life as a civil servant and actress?\n\nI go to work very early to do my job and get back early to be on movie set. Being an actress has given me a lot of opportunities and has helped me in my job as well, because people tend to trust you more with information as an actress.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing a fan has done to you?\n\nDespite knowing that I\u2019m married, some fans still tell me \u2018I love you and I want to marry you\u2019.\n\nYou mean you still get toasters even as a married woman?\n\nOf course, yes. Even if you are 100 years old, men will still toast you. If they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you, they will still toast you so that when you commit a mistake, they can use it against you.\n\nHave you had any experience as regards sex for role?\n\nNot at all.\n\nWhat is the next project for you?\n\nProducing my own movie is not the main thing as it is a regular thing. My main aim is to act in Hollywood.\n\nAre you in any way threatened by the new faces in Nollywood?\n\nNo way.

          "title": "Anxiety Mounts as Deadline for Buhari to Sign Electoral Bill Expires Today",
          "text": "\u2022SANs ask National Assembly to override Buhari\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja, and Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos\n\nAnxiety has gripped Nigerians over the conduct of future elections as the constitutional time limit for President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 ends today, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the inclusion of direct primaries is one of the major hurdles that may militate against Buhari\u2019s assent.\n\nWhile there are indications that Buhari, who is still in Turkey, may sign the bill and send an amendment to the National Assembly, some senior lawyers have asked the federal lawmakers to override the president.\n\nSection 58(4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) stipulates that where a bill is presented to the president for assent, he shall within 30 days thereof signify that he assents or that he withholds assent.\n\nUnder Section 58(5), the constitution states: \u201cWhere the president withholds his assents and the bill is again passed by each house by a two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law and the assent of the President shall not be required.\u201d\n\nToday, December 19, 2021, is the deadline mandated by the Constitution for the president to sign the electoral bill sent to him for assent on November 19, 2021.\n\nCurrently, the president is on an official state visit to Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nIt was learnt that he might refuse to sign the bill and ask the National Assembly to consider some of the major issues.\n\nA top official at the presidency told THISDAY that the president wants the direct primary imposed on political parties in the new bill removed, based on the advice of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\n\u201cThere is already a Supreme Court judgment that political parties should be allowed to decide their internal affairs. So, the president believes that imposing a direct primary on political parties would amount to imposing a decision on them on the conduct of their affairs,\u201d the source explained.\n\nSome political parties, including the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had kicked against the direct primary and insisted that parties should be allowed to decide the management of their internal affairs democratically.\n\nThe presidency source further explained that Buhari is also concerned with the cost and security implications of direct primary.\n\nIn the letter by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, to the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, and the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, dated November 29, 2021, the president had requested their inputs on the cost and security implications of the electoral bill.\n\nThe presidency source told THISDAY that it was based on the IG and the minister\u2019s comments on the cost and security implications of direct primary elections by political parties that Buhari has raised objections against the direct primary.\n\nThe source concluded that since Buhari is expected back in Nigeria from Turkey today, he may be persuaded to sign the bill and send an amendment to areas he had raised objections to.\n\nINEC had on December 3, 2021, replied to Buhari\u2019s letter directing it to explain some issues contained in the electoral bill transmitted to it by the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to the reliable source in the presidency, it was INEC\u2019s considered opinion that the bill contains substantial provisions that would lay a solid foundation for important improvements in the electoral process.\n\nINEC, he said, had highlighted landmark proposals in the bill that would radically improve the quality of elections.\n\nThese include Electronic transmission of results, early submission of list of nominated candidates, and the power of INEC to review election results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws and guidelines.\n\nINEC said in its response that \u201can accelerated assent to the bill will facilitate the preparation of major elections such as the FCT municipal area council election, Ekiti and Osun states governorship elections, and the 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nIt, therefore, urged the president not to hesitate in signing the bill on electoral reforms.\n\nSANs Ask N\u2019Assembly to Override Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, as the constitutional time limit for Buhari to sign the bill ends today, some senior lawyers yesterday asked the National Assembly to override the decision of the president if he withholds his assent.\n\nThe legal icons, also, faulted a position credited to Malami in a leaked letter to the president that making direct primary mandatory for all political parties would confuse.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that if the National Assembly goes on recess on December 21 as proposed and resumes in the third week of January 2022, the lawmakers may not have the time limit to veto the president.\n\nInterim Chair, Alliance on Surviving COVID-19 and Beyond (ASCAB), Mr. Femi Falana (SAN); a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Chief Joseph Daudu; human rights lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa; Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN); constitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN); and Mr. John Baiyeshea (SAN), told THISDAY that the federal lawmakers should veto the president.\n\nWhile INEC and the leadership of the National Assembly had advised the president to sign the bill, most states governors and Malami had asked him to reject the bill on the ground that making direct primary mode mandatory would create confusion among political parties.\n\nWith the constitutional time limit ending today, Falana challenged the National Assembly to proceed to override the decision of the president if he withholds his assent in line with section 58(5) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFalana said if the president withholds assent again as he did in 2018, the lawmakers should initiate the process of overriding the decision of the president, which according to him, required a two-thirds majority of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nFalana, however, explained that the challenge of the governors \u201cis not direct primary mode. The real problem is the electronic transmission of election results because it will stop manipulation.\n\n\u201cThe governors now want the president to throw away the baby and bathwater. That is how the president rejected it in 2018 under the guise that it was close to the general election.\n\n\u201cThe 2010 Electoral Act provides for direct and indirect primaries specifically under section 87 (1), (2) & (3) of the Act. Under this regime, direct primary mode is optional. In the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, it becomes mandatory. The question of some leaders sitting somewhere to impose candidates will not arise again.\u201d\n\nOn Malami\u2019s letter, Falana asked the president to ignore misleading advice from unsolicited quarters, especially potential governorship aspirants, noting that such advice \u201cis based on personal interests and not in the national interest.\u201d\n\nThe human rights lawyer also, added that the question of political parties amending their constitutions \u201cto accommodate direct primaries does not arise as they are already part and parcel of the electoral law.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Daudu noted that under the subsisting electoral regime, indirect primaries, direct primaries, and consensus had been identified as the options open to the political parties to select and submit candidates for elections.\n\nHe explained how the overbearing roles of the governors in the entire electoral process compelled the lawmakers and other stakeholders to introduce the direct primary mode during the amendment of the Electoral Act in 2015.\n\nThe senior lawyer argued that over the years, the other stakeholders \u201chave accused the state governors of having a stranglehold on the entire electoral process, especially the process leading to the selection of candidates.\n\nDaudu explained how members of the National Assembly took a collective exception to the stranglehold of the governors on the electoral process considering implications such influence had on their nominations for election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is understandable, as it was getting increasingly clear that even their re-election to their various seats at the National Assembly was shaky without the endorsement of their respective governors.\n\n\u201cConsequently, like a bolt from the blues, the legislators inserted by legislative fiat, a clause in the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill stipulating that the party flag bearers can only be selected by the direct primary medium or mode by their political parties.\u201d\n\nNBA\u2019s former president said: \u201cThe legislators want to call the shots, and in the process, upstage the governors as to who occupies an electoral office in Nigeria. Thus, it is not about internal democracy, but about who emerges as the winner in 2023.\n\n\u201cHence, this Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill as engineered by the National Assembly who together with some segments of the civil society organisations want to use the new law to shift the power base. Now, it is not Buhari\u2019s duty to weigh in on the side of one of the two combatants.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the responsibility of the President \u201cis to bequeath on Nigeria an enduring electoral legislation that will enthrone free, fair, and credible elections and not arbitrate between legislators and governors as to who will have the electoral advantage come 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, Adegboruwa told THISDAY that there \u201care many innovative provisions in the bill that makes it attractive as a tool to oil our democratic experiment, especially the issues of electronic transmission of election results and direct primaries for the political parties.\n\n\u201cFrom the events monitored on the floor of the National Assembly and indeed the public hearings conducted, it is clear that Nigerians prefer that results of elections be transmitted electronically by INEC to avoid the recurring decimal of manipulation and rigging.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adegboruwa, direct primaries for the choice of candidates of political parties will eliminate the hydra-headed issues of godfatherism and imposition of candidates.\n\nRelying on section 58 (5) of the 1999 Constitution, the senior lawyer urged the National Assembly, in the national interest, \u201cto invoke their constitutional powers to pass the Electoral Bill and save our democracy from imminent collapse.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigerians expect the National Assembly to shake off the toga of being a rubber stamp entity and use this golden opportunity to assert their autonomy.\n\n\u201cThis matter is important and pressing enough to warrant the suspension of the current recess of the National Assembly to pass the Bill and in that wise, override presidential assent. Nothing is too much to give to salvage our hard-earned democracy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on whether Saturdays and Sundays are included in the 30 days, Adegboruwa stated that the \u201cConstitution only says 30 days and there is no distinction on 30 working days.\u201d\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Ozekhome, also disclosed that the 30 days will expire today.\n\n\u201cUnder section 58(4-5), it will expire today. By tomorrow, which is Monday, the National Assembly can convene. But we do not have a National Assembly. They are lily-livered. They are spineless. If they are a strong National Assembly, they will convene on Monday and get the two-third majority of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives and override the president\u2019s withholding assent.\n\n\u201cWhat the president has not done now is to veto the bill by assenting to it. But the National Assembly can override it under Section 58(4-5) of the 1999 Constitution. They should go ahead and override the president\u2019s veto.\n\n\u201cI do not agree with the argument of the AGF. Because the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 introduces the direct primary, you should kill the whole Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill? The argument that political parties will have to change their constitutions does not arise at all.\n\n\u201cThe political parties can always change their constitutions. What is the big deal? Is that why you should kill the whole Electoral Act that contains electronic transmission of results, which is a leap forward? That argument is red herring. I think the president should assent to this bill. Since today is Sunday, he should assent to it today. The last day falls on today, which is Sunday. He must assent to it today. If he does not, the National Assembly must meet tomorrow and override the president\u2019s veto. They have that power,\u201d Ozekhome explained.\n\nBut for Mr. Ahmed Raji (SAN), the big question is whether Nigeria as a country can currently afford the huge cost of the Direct Primary being proposed in the amended bill.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, Raji also further questioned the capacity of INEC as well as that of the various political parties to conduct direct primary elections.\n\n\u201cMy frank position is that the National Assembly should holistically and thoroughly examine the reservations of Mr. President. Direct Primary is new and it is looking like a mini general election. Can we afford it? Is INEC well equipped for it? Do the parties have credible members\u2019 registers? And what is the effect on our court system? And is our life all about elections?\u201d he queried.\n\nIn his reaction, Mr. John Baiyeshea (SAN), insisted that if the President does not sign the Electoral Bill, the next thing that should happen is to invoke the Constitutional provisions to override the president\u2019s veto.\n\nThe senior lawyer, however, expressed doubt that the present dispensation of lawmakers has what it takes to override the president.\n\n\u201cEven under the rather \u2018hostile\u2019 leadership of the National Assembly in the immediate past dispensation (is it the 8th Assembly they called it), the president vetoed an Electoral Bill and other Bills. And they did not override him then.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the present rather \u2018friendly\u2019 leadership of the National Assembly galvanising the National Assembly members to override him\u201d, he said.\n\nBut Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN) argued that the result-oriented approach would be that if the President is not persuaded to sign the bill, \u201cboth Houses of the National Assembly have the constitutional mandate or power to take a second and possibly harder look at the Bill.\n\n\u201cOnce they are doubly convinced that the Bill as initially passed would do more good than harm to the polity, it would be proper for the National Assembly to override the veto of the President bypassing the Bill into law with the requisite majority.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari Rallies International Support against Terrorism",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has called on the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit to provide concrete support to help defeat terrorism and insurgency on the African continent.\n\nThe president who made the call yesterday while speaking at the third edition of the summit in Istanbul Turkey admitted that the Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and degraded by Nigeria\u2019s defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also yesterday again drew the attention of Buhari to the fact Nigeria is collapsing due to terrorists\u2019 activities.\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed delight that the Summit convened by Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has given due consideration to the issue of terrorism, while also focusing on development and infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThis is coming as Erdogan has stated that Turkey would send 15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Africa, adding that the low vaccination rates there was a blot on humanity.\n\nBuhari advised that the partnership should also focus on the global challenge of climate change which is impacting Nigeria, Turkey, and indeed the world at large.\n\nAccording to him, it has become a catalyst for conflict through food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe trend is the same around the world where communities are overwhelmed by forest fires, rising sea levels, flood, drought, and desertification. I want to seize this opportunity to appeal for support for initiatives such as Africa\u2019s Great Green Wall on Environment and Land Management, which is designed to fight the effects of climate change and desertification in Africa. The initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land in the 11 countries of the Sahel-Sahara strip, capture 250 million tons of carbon and, create 10 million green jobs by 2030.\u201d\n\nOn the global coronavirus pandemic, Buhari urged nations to follow the example of Africa-Turkey cooperation, which emphasises solidarity and support in tackling the challenge.\n\nThe president noted that given the increasingly unpredictable nature of contemporary global challenges facing mankind, world leaders must continue to put the wellbeing of humanity at the centre of the agenda for the common good and prosperity of all.\n\nWhile applauding President Erdogan for initiating the Turkey-Africa Partnership in 2008, Buhari urged the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCTA) to assist in further increasing the level of Africa-Turkey trade, leading to a win-win for all countries.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The pandemic is a global challenge which calls for global solidarity and solutions and the Africa-Turkey cooperation model has proved to be an example to the world. Not only has there been mutual support to respond to the pandemic but also mutual support to build resilience and sustainable development in other sectors. We also commend the African Union for the excellent role it has been playing in coordinating the implementation process of the Partnership.\n\nWe must therefore promote science, technology, and innovation and share knowledge from research and development to better equip us to address present and future challenges more equitably and sustainably.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Nigeria strongly endorses the Summit Declaration as well as the 2022-2026 Joint Action Plan. We are confident that given the level of openness, trust and commitment manifested in the Africa\u2013Turkey Partnership, this cooperation mechanism will be a game-changer for our countries and set us on the path of sustainable development for our peoples\u201d\n\nNigeria is Collapsing, Ortom Tells Buhari in Birthday Message\n\nMeanwhile, Benue State Governor, Ortom, yesterday again drew Buhari\u2019s attention to the fact Nigeria is collapsing due to the activities of terrorists.\n\nOrtom said the president is a grandfather who should understand that people are dying daily unnecessarily in the hands of terrorists.\n\nIn a message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, yesterday, to congratulate Buhari on his 79th birthday, the governor was quoted as saying that the insecurity affecting citizens was not what the president promised when he assumed office in 2015.\n\nAccording to the statement, the governor, who said he loves Buhari, urged him to take urgent action to secure the country before he leaves office.\n\nOrtom pleaded with the president to use his 79th birthday, not as a member of a political party or any religious bias, but as a grandfather and a nationalist, to address the obvious imbalances in the nation now before he hands over power in 2023.\n\n\u201cI join your family, friends, political associates, and all Nigerians to congratulate you on the occasion of your 79th birthday,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo some, the president is a father, to others, grandfather while yet to others, he is a great grandfather who should understand that Nigeria at the moment is collapsing due to the activities of terrorists who have continued to destroy the very foundation of the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in perpetual fear as strangers in their own country is not acceptable.\n\n\u201cDaily, people are slaughtered like animals either on their farms, at home, or roasted to death while travelling from one destination to another with video clips showing the faces of the killers. Yet, no one has been arrested.\n\n\u201cThe roads have become booby traps where the citizenry are scared to travel on, for the fear that they may be kidnapped for ransom or in some cases killed outrightly. It is an open secret that no one is safe in this country any longer.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in fear.\n\n\u201cThe president should not listen to sycophants who may not be telling him the truth that all is well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll is not well with Nigeria right now, Mr. President.

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) has clarified that loans from China to Nigeria, which presently stood at $3.59billion were largely concessional as no national asset was tagged as collateral.\n\nThe Director-General of DMO, Ms Patience Oniha, who made this known in an interview yesterday, also disclosed that the loan constitutes only 9.4 per cent of the country\u2019s total foreign debt stock of $37.9 billion.\n\nIn recent times, both the social and mainstream media have been awash with news about some African countries, including Nigeria, facing the threat of losing some critical national assets to the Asian country due to high-level indebtedness.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s total debt stock as at September 30 was $37.9 billion; this figure comprised the external debt stock of the federal government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cBut total loans from China stands at $3.59 billion, which is 9.47 per cent of the total external debt. The loans did not require any national asset as collateral; they were largely concessional,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha urged Nigerians to always endeavour to verify sensitive information from official sources before disseminating it.\n\nShe explained that before foreign loans were contracted, very sensitive steps were taken by multiple institutions of government to ensure that they were beneficial to the nation.\n\n\u201cBefore any foreign loan is contracted, including the issuance of Eurobond, they are approved by the Federal Executive Council and thereafter, the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAn important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are approved by the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cAn opinion is issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice before the agreements are signed.\n\n\u201cSeveral measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due. Provisions are made explicitly for debt service in the annual budgets,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha explained that the loans agreements provided a number of steps to take to resolve dispute when they arise.\n\n\u201cThe first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails, they go to arbitration.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a lender, in this case, China, would not just pounce on an asset at the first sign of a dispute, including defaults,\u2019\u2019 the she said.\n\nShe explained that the DMO maintained proper records of debts, provided projections for debt service and processed the actual payments for debt service.\n\nShe pointed out that those functions were carried out in conjunction with the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He was said to be on his way from a memorial lecture in honour of his late wife.\n\nHe was reportedly killed alongside his police escort and one Aloysius, identified as his driver.\n\nHis death generated condemnations from many Nigerians.

Kehinde Osifala, NIStructE president, said the changes made to the project appear to \u201chave been seriously inadequate\u201d and that \u201cpreliminary investigation also revealed some evidence of structural inadequacy in the construction and signs of some structural distress had already started to show within certain elements of the building\u201d.\n\nHere is TheCable\u2019s obituary on the real estate tycoon.\n\nTORDUE SALEM \u2013 VANGUARD NEWSPAPER REPORTER\n\nWhile Nigerians were still reeling from numerous reports of killings across the country, the news of the death of Tordue Salem, Vanguard newspaper reporter, filtered in.\n\nSalem, a house of representatives correspondent, was found dead in Abuja \u2013 weeks after he was declared missing.\n\nHe was declared missing after he was last seen on October 13.\n\nThe news of the death of the reporter came about two days after the green chamber passed a resolution mandating all security agencies to immediately investigate his whereabouts.\n\nThe police, however, said Salem was killed by a hit-and-run driver. He was said to have been killed on Mabushi highway in the federal capital territory (FCT).\n\nThe police said a 29-year-old suspect \u2014 Itoro Clement \u2014 was arrested in connection to the crime following an investigation by the force intelligence bureau.\n\nThe suspect reportedly confessed that he knocked down the reporter and did not stop to check the victim because \u201cthe area is known for criminal activities\u201d.\n\nBABA SUWE \u2013 YORUBA ACTOR\n\nDeath struck again in the movie industry and this time, it took Babatunde Omidina, comic Yoruba actor popularly known as Baba Suwe.\n\nBaba Suwe died in November after a long battle with an undisclosed ailment.\n\nBaba Suwe, who was popular in the movie industry, had a run-in with a law enforcement agency in 2011 when he was arrested by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) at Murtala Mohammed International Airport over the suspicion that he was trafficking drugs.\n\nHe was detained for three weeks and allegedly tortured on suspicion of ingesting cocaine wraps. He was later granted bail after no drugs were found on him.\n\nAlthough a Lagos high court had ordered that Baba Suwe be compensated with the sum of N25 million after no drugs were found on him, the veteran actor lamented years later that he did not receive any compensation.\n\nTwice in 2019, he was rumoured to have died while he was abroad for medical treatment. The rumour was debunked by his colleagues in the movie industry.\n\nHe had earlier solicited financial support to enable him to travel abroad for medical attention.\n\nWhile sharing the video of the corpse of his father online, Adesola Omidina, son to Baba Suwe, claimed that people abandoned his father but he later retracted his statement and apologised for his comment after he was criticised and accused of \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the late actor.\n\nYou can read the obituary on the ace film star here.\n\nABUBAKAR SHEKAU\u2013BOKO HARAM LEADER\n\nIf death could be said to bring relief and joy to people, the death of Abubakar Shekau did just that. Shekau was the leader of Boko Haram in Nigeria until his death in May.\n\nThe Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP), a breakaway faction of Boko Haram, confirmed the death of Shekau, former leader of the terrorist group. He was said to have blown himself up on May 19 following a confrontation with ISWAP fighters.\n\nHe was said to have killed himself with a bomb \u201cwhen he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive\u201d.\n\nThe report of his death was met with mixed feelings \u2013 while many were elated, some were doubtful about the genuineness of the news owing to the fact that the army had claimed, on several occasions, to have killed Shekau but the Boko Haram leader resurfaced in online videos, debunking those claims.\n\nAlthough the army said it could not confirm if he was truly dead, many Nigerians hope he remains dead.",

The rumour was debunked by his colleagues in the movie industry.\n\nHe had earlier solicited financial support to enable him to travel abroad for medical attention.\n\nWhile sharing the video of the corpse of his father online, Adesola Omidina, son to Baba Suwe, claimed that people abandoned his father but he later retracted his statement and apologised for his comment after he was criticised and accused of \u201cdisrespecting\u201d the late actor.\n\nYou can read the obituary on the ace film star here.\n\nABUBAKAR SHEKAU\u2013BOKO HARAM LEADER\n\nIf death could be said to bring relief and joy to people, the death of Abubakar Shekau did just that. Shekau was the leader of Boko Haram in Nigeria until his death in May.\n\nThe Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP), a breakaway faction of Boko Haram, confirmed the death of Shekau, former leader of the terrorist group. He was said to have blown himself up on May 19 following a confrontation with ISWAP fighters.\n\nHe was said to have killed himself with a bomb \u201cwhen he observed that the ISWAP fighters wanted to capture him alive\u201d.\n\nThe report of his death was met with mixed feelings \u2013 while many were elated, some were doubtful about the genuineness of the news owing to the fact that the army had claimed, on several occasions, to have killed Shekau but the Boko Haram leader resurfaced in online videos, debunking those claims.\n\nAlthough the army said it could not confirm if he was truly dead, many Nigerians hope he remains dead.",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their affiliate commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance. Failing cluster managers can\u2019t get additional terminals, and this means their multi-level earnings on their agent network caps. No one wants that. So they\u2019d have to retrieve the non-performing terminals and give them to better agents.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail\u201d \u2014 Benjamin Franklin\n\nA few weeks ago, we started a discussion on The Next Frontier. Since then, we\u2019ve explored The Next Frontier as it relates to edtech and fintech. This week, we\u2019re doing something a bit different.\n\nDrawing from previous discussions, we will look at four future developments in tech and what they could mean for you either as a student, startup founder, entrepreneur, or policymaker.\n\nAI and more data applications in edtech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Pixabay on Pexels\n\nThere have been considerable developments in Africa\u2019s edtech space, from remote learning to self-paced learning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the future, the application of artificial intelligence and proper data management would be groundbreaking. In the case of AI, it would be improving learning efficiency for students and teachers.\n\nOne of the challenges of traditional education is the inability to tailor teaching to the needs of students and AI can help with that through personalised learning.\n\nSo this could mean that while there may be several students in a class, they would all be taught at different levels and tested on different subjects.\n\nThe other development would be in the use of data. As more students use edtech solutions, a lot of data would be gotten that could also help in providing better learning outcomes.\n\nEven more interesting is that these developments would not be beneficial to students alone. Teachers would be able to develop curriculums that draw on the students\u2019 strengths.\n\nRepetitive and administrative tasks would also be cut down or eliminated using AI.\n\nAPI healthtech startups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash\n\nThe fintech industry has benefited a great deal from the presence of API fintech startups as they have eased interoperability. The same looks set to be done for the healthtech space.\n\nCurrently, there are no African startups providing healthtech startups with an API. Consequently, data obtained exists in silos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPI startups could, therefore, be a game-changer. Imagine for a moment that you are a patient who has been using a healthtech provider but now needs to switch to another for some reason.\n\nWithout API startups, the process of getting your medical history has to begin afresh, but with an API startup, all that information could be gotten in seconds.\n\nIn addition, healthtech APIs mean that startups no longer have to build all the solutions they need but instead focus on the areas in which they excel.\n\nCompanies investing in companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem matures, one trend that Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO, believes could become commonplace is companies investing in companies.\n\nAlready, we\u2019re seeing some form of it with Interswitch\u2019s investment in Okhi and Flutterwave\u2019s investment in CinetPay.\n\nWhat this would do is help companies consolidate their efforts. So rather than have several companies in a space but only slightly moving the needle, the resources and skills can be combined to go after a larger market.\n\nUsing the fintech industry as an example, it could mean that more financially excluded people get access to financial services.\n\nCompanies investing in companies would also mean that the smaller startup could leverage the assets and experience of the larger startup to build more efficient services and attract other investors.\n\nContactless cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service, you will be familiar with contactless cards. You transfer money to it and use it to pay your bus fares.\n\nNow, imagine your financial service provider issuing such a card. You\u2019d no longer be bothered about leaving the house without cash or your ATM card.\n\nYou could pay for groceries or dates without using cash or punching in your ATM card PIN. It is also a safer option for users as it reduces the chances of being robbed. For business owners, it also improves the customer experience while protecting against fraud.\n\nIf you were not aware, The next frontier is also the theme for Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nHolding on January 22, 2022, it will feature startup competitions and exhibitions in addition to conversations on The next frontier.

          "title": "A Zimbabwean Data Protection Act to rule them all. Or not",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 3, 2021, Zimbabwe joined the list of African countries that can now boast a data protection law.\n\nLike the second instalment in this series, a tweet spurred this article. This tweet by tweeter, @RangMberi intrigued me for two reasons.\n\nNever having followed the Zimbabwean scene, it was nice to see. However, the tweet\u2019s contents were of more interest to me.\n\nFrom the screenshots Mberi shared, several acts such as revenge pornography, child pornography, and taking pictures of people\u2019s genitalia without their consent have become illegal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a data protection act, these were some intriguing provisions.\n\nA walk down memory lane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nBefore the current Act, Zimbabwe\u2019s laws have made provisions \u2014 albeit in a fragmented manner \u2014 for data protection and privacy.\n\nThe Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act dealt more with the collection, protection, and retention of personal information held by public officers. Other laws included the Consumer Protection Act, Census and Statistics Act, and the Interception of Communication Act, among others.\n\nBut this new law has been in the works for a while as well. First gazetted in May 2020 as the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill, it has since undergone some changes.\n\nInitially, The Cybercrimes and Data Protection Bill was to cover all things incidental to Cybercrime and Data Protection. Essentially a mash-up of two different but related fields.\n\nBut a lot of people weren\u2019t having that. Transparency International complained that it was a human rights lawsuit waiting to happen \u2014 especially regarding government spying and stifling freedom of speech. Other persons decried the bill as well.\n\nIn July 2020, Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committees released a report asking that both fields be separated and an independent body be set up, among other recommendations.\n\nAnd it appears Parliament may have listened, somewhat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current state of affairs\n\nThe Data Protection Act, as it is known now, is styled after the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) model law on data protection.\n\nIt provides for most of what you\u2019d expect from a data protection law; things like data rights of the data subject, what personal information is, and what sensitive information is, among others.\n\nIt provides extensively for consent \u2014 very important \u2014 and it introduces the vital issue of representation of infants and persons that are mentally, legally, or physically incapacitated by their parents and guardians.\n\nIt also explains other important provisions and duties of the data controller and processor, which we have touched on in previous articles.\n\nThe Act also establishes a Data Protection Authority (DPA), but this is where it gets a bit tricky. The DPA appointed in this case is an existing authority called the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ).\n\nPOTRAZ is Zimbabwe\u2019s telecommunications sector regulator, already saddled with responsibilities in that regard. Adding this to that is an interesting move, especially considering all of the duties assigned to them under this new law.\n\n\u201cI think they are going to be saddled with too much administrative authority. Because imagine having to handle all these breaches that will come within 48 hours. I don\u2019t know yet how adequately prepared they are for this.\n\n\u201cI tried to put together the duties of the DPA, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 resource-wise \u2014 whether they\u2019d be able to achieve all of that,\u201d Nellie Tiyango, a Zimbabwean lawyer, tells me.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the fact that POTRAZ already has some experience on the data collection and protection front.\n\n\u201cIt should have been because POTRAZ was already collecting data. Because that\u2019s where our telecoms as well fall under in terms of picking up sensitive information. We\u2019ve got the Interception of Communication Act, and I think POTRAZ was in charge of that. The rationale could have been that they already have a lot of data. And it might be easier than starting afresh.\u201d\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee, the new act was renamed the Data Protection Act instead of the Cybercrimes and Data Protection Act.\n\nHowever, after comparing the previous bill and the current Act, I found that it was merely rearranged to have all the parts touching on data protection at the beginning and the chapters touching on cybersecurity at the end.\n\nI worried that this could also create a duplication of laws and expressed this to Tiyango. But she had a differing opinion.\n\n\u201cData and cyber go hand-in-hand. There needed to be something that speaks to the issue of cybersecurity from a data perspective, which is what has been done. And I\u2019m sure [that] when we get the Cybersecurity law we will be able to see whether there\u2019s a duplication. I don\u2019t think that this causes any confusion. It\u2019s necessary.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the Act does not mention notifying a data subject where there is a breach of their data. So, say Peter, a Zimbabwean who uses a fintech app for sending money, has his data stolen by someone who hacked into the company\u2019s servers, it appears he might never find out that his data has been stolen.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation \u2014 the first comprehensive data protection law \u2014 provides for this. For some reason, Nigeria\u2019s National Data Protection Regulation has no such provision.\n\nThere are also issues of cross-border transfer of information between countries within and outside the SADC.\n\nFor instance, say you are conducting a cross-border transfer of funds, your data is flying over several countries, and the platform you are using has to ensure that the receiving platform has adequate resources in place to protect your data. If it doesn\u2019t, then your data should not be transferred.\n\nTiyango is interested in how this would play out, especially in scenarios where data is transferred to a non-SADC country.\n\nThe tech ecosystem and data protection\n\nAccording to Tiyango, \u201cThe Act aims to create a technology-driven business environment, encourage technological development, and the lawful use of technology.\u201d\n\nFrom what she tells me, companies like electronic communications networks or access providers, data collection and analytics techs, fintechs, mobile service providers, payment platforms, Internet service providers, satellite television service providers, and health services, including laboratories and testing techs, would have to comply.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nThe Zimbabwean Act is fresh out of the oven and needs time to cool before we can fully dissect all of the possible scenarios that could occur here.\n\nWill POTRAZ be able to handle all of its duties? Will there be a marked difference between the Data Protection Act and a possible Cybercrimes bill? Most of all, how would all of this affect the data rights of Zimbabweans?\n\nThis is a developing story, and we\u2019ll be bringing more on this as we get more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "Nigeria-based logistics company launches HELP, to provide ambulance services with its Uber-like model",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cUber-like platform for ambulances\u201d reechoed in the room, as HELP, an acronym for Health Emergency Linkage Portal, announced the launch of its GPS based mobile application and emergency healthcare hotline on October 5, 2021.\n\nThe healthtech and logistics company is on a mission to provide quality health care emergency services via a mobile application that allows you to order for an ambulance in case of an emergency, or schedule ahead of a medical appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProper and affordable health care is a fundamental human right. Sadly, in most developing countries like Nigeria, good healthcare is a privilege and accessing medical facilities can be an onerous task. The healthcare sector in the country is crippled with challenges like sluggish response to emergency cases, poor health infrastructure, low number of health workers, amongst other limitations. Deji Faborode, Co-founder and CEO of HELP, says this is the gap they are trying to bridge, one step at a time.\n\n\u201cA lot can be done and we\u2019re still scratching the surface of healthcare solutions in Nigeria. Things are not working as they should as a result of misaligned objectives. Our people are scared for their lives, because what happens in the case of a health emergency? Existing emergency structures don\u2019t meet the demand. This is what brought the vision for HELP. One of the gaps we\u2019re hoping to bridge is the hopelessness in emergency situations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe goes further to add that the big picture is creating interconnected systems to complement the existing ones, in order to have a fully working and unified body of ambulance service providers.\n\nDeji Faborode (CEO), Yewande Alebiosu (COO), Victor Iwenya (CTO) and Tomiwa Ogunbona (CPO) birthed the idea to leverage technology in enhancing interconnectedness, building a collaborative healthcare ecosystem, and breaking the silos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 23 months later, the HELP journey to improve access to emergency care has kicked off.\n\nHow it works\n\nThe HELP mobile app is currently available for Android users on the Play Store and is soon to be available on the App Store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHELP website\n\nIndividuals or corporate bodies sign up, create an account, receive an OTP to confirm registration, and can search for and access ambulances nearest to them. There is also a Healthcare facility navigator which serves as a directory of hospitals and pharmacies closest to the user\u2019s geographical location.\n\nThere are two levels of external partners at HELP, Service Partners and Client Partners. Service partners on the HELP platform include hospitals, health facilities, and private ambulance owners in the country. Client partners include Health Maintenance Organisations(HMO) and Corporate organisations who enroll their members.\n\nThe Client partners\u2019 subscription plan comes in three tiers, Gold, Silver and Bronze. Each varies with the size of the ambulance being ordered and the equipment available for the service needed. Every ambulance type has a base price but prices vary based on distance covered and time spent.\n\nEach user has a unique wallet on the app created for making payments. This cuts out the hurdle of having to re-enter financial information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe HELP app has a feature that allows you to fill in the details of the emergency, to provide adequate information to the paramedics present in the ambulance. The HELP app comes with a feature that allows one to share details like driver\u2019s information, trip history, and the hospital sending the ambulance, with their loved ones. Due to the geo mapping system integrated on the app, routes taken can be tracked and recorded.\n\nBeyond an application, HELP has a hotline, 0-700-HELPSTATION, for cases where there is inability to access mobile networks in an emergency situation. Interestingly, a random person can access the HELP service with the code.\n\nAs the floor opened for comments, some members of the audience shared stories of having lost loved ones as a result of delayed responses to emergency calls and lack of medical assistance in crisis situations. These problems reflect the pillars of quick response, accessibility and coordination that HELP is looking to run on.\n\nOn plans for investments and expansion, Faborode shares that as much as the startup is open to social grants and funding, the key focus at the moment is gaining traction, spreading the word and above all, providing excellent service to users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "title": "Bleak yuletide as low purchasing power hits Nigerian households",
          "text": "Complaints and cries of agony are heard from every part of Nigeria. Citizens are lamenting hard times. Everywhere one turns, the complaint, \u201cno money\u201d is the sing-song.\n\nThe Nigerian government, which has made borrowing its cardinal policy, has over-borrowed and now living with the consequences of not even being capable of putting smiles on the faces of workers under its employ.\n\nIt had announced that it would be unable to pay the salary of civil servants this December. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), the umbrella body of workers in the country, has since screamed: \u201cfoul.\u201d\n\nNigerians, once regarded as the happiest people on earth, are today the saddest. Every rating organisation has scored the country zero on many fronts.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate is so high at 33.3percent and the inflation rate at 15.99percent according to the released Consumer Price Index report, by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in October. Nigeria has been rated the poverty capital of the world with one of the worst human rights records.\n\nA nation of over 100 million people has a large population of the poor with a negligible club of the super-rich, who incidentally find it difficult to sleep now because the poor is awake.\n\nIt is startling that Christmas is six days from today, yet no sign of festivity in the air.\n\nSome years back, by now gift items and hampers would have flooded everywhere, but they appear to be scarce commodities this time around. A few that are in the market and shops are too exorbitant for the average Nigerian.\n\nOrdinarily, for surviving Covid-19 since 2020 and still alive in the face of emerging variants, especially Delta and recently Omicron, an average Nigerian would have rolled out big drums to celebrate the survival.\n\nBut that celebration is on hold because there is no money to celebrate. The worst still is that many are not going to celebrate Christmas and New Year the way they used to; there is no purchasing power to do so.\n\nTruly, the economic realities in the country are impacting very negatively on the masses, with many finding it difficult to even feed, and then, talk of celebration.\n\nIt is obvious that the successive recessions witnessed in the country in the last four years, and the impact of the pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020, which is still being felt today have combined to make the people poorer and drain deep pockets, leaving many with little or no purchasing power.\n\nOf course, the high level of inflation, which has seen the prices of goods skyrocket this year more than any year in the history of the country, has resulted in many adjusting and cutting costs, even for Christmas this year.\n\nWith a bag of rice going for about N30,000, two litres of cooking oil going for N2,500, tomatoes and onions scarce due to the impact of herdsmen attack farmers, chicken and cow meat are very expensive, many families see no reason to celebrate this Christmas with empty pockets.\n\nMarket prices\n\nBD SUNDAY market survey shows that 50kg bag of foreign and local rice, which formerly sold for N12,000 and N10,000, respectively, few years back now sell for N29,000 and N27,000 respectively.\n\nAlso, 25kg bag of foreign and local rice, which used to go for N6,000 and N5,000 now sell for N14, 500 andN13,500. A paint bucket and derica of foreign rice sell for N3,000 and N500 while local rice sells for N2,500 and N450 respectively.\n\nA bag of beans which even until last year was sold for N9,000 now sells for between N35,000 and N70,000 depending on the type of beans; one paint bucket of beans, which was formerly sold for between N1,250 and N1,300 now sell for N3,500 while one derica that was sold for N250 now goes for N650.\n\nA pack of spaghetti which was formerly sold for N3,000 now goes for N7,000 while one that was formerly sold for N150 now goes for N350.\n\nMeanwhile, 20 litres of vegetable oil now goes for a minimum between N26,000 and N28, 000; 10 litres sell for between N13,000 and N16,000, while 5 litres sell for between N6,500 and N10,000.\n\nFor red oil, 20 litres sold for about N15, 000 now goes for N25, 500 while 10 litres that was formerly N7,500 now sells for N12,750.\n\nA carton of frozen chicken popularly called \u2018Orobo chicken\u2019 which was formerly sold for about N9,500 from the cold room, now goes for N19,500 while a kilo goes for about N2,400.\n\nA carton of ordinary frozen chicken goes for N15, 000 while a kilo is sold for about N2, 000. A carton of frozen turkey which was formerly sold for N11, 500 or N12, 500 now goes for N23, 500 depending on the location.\n\nA carton of frozen fish such as Titus now goes for N23,500 while mackerel fish are popularly known as Kote now go for N19,600 at the cold room.\n\nHigh transport fare\n\nFor those who usually travel to celebrate with their loved ones, the unimaginable high transport fare is a major obstacle as a single adult will spend close to N50,000 to and fro on transport to the desired destination this festive season, particularly those who live in Lagos, wishing to travel to any South-East state.\n\nAs of Saturday, December 18, 2021, all inter-state transport companies had increased their fares for routes across the country by 100 percent.\n\nThe ever-busy Lagos-South-East route, which was about N8,000 as at the last week in November was pegged from N15,000 on Saturday and will increase further to almost N25,000, some worried observers noted.\n\nEmeka Nwaka, a medical doctor and father of three, decried the economic reality of the time, saying it does not allow for waste and unnecessary travel again, including Christmas, if the cost will impact the budget of the family hugely.\n\n\u201cI always travel home for Christmas in the last 11 years, but I am having a rethink this year because of the cost and risks,\u201d Nwaka said.\n\nFor him, there is life after Christmas and New Year. \u201cBy January, there are many financial obligations to meet from house rent, exorbitant school fees, tax, utility bills, daily upkeeps, among others that make a mess of whatever anybody earns as income. So, my family is not travelling this year because of the huge cost,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the same vein, Gbemi Okikioluwa, an economist and banker, decried that the purchasing power of many is very low now and that many will celebrate Christmas without the usual fanfare of traditional Christmas rice and killing of the fattest chicken, goat or cow.\n\n\u201cAt present, inflation is at work despite the government\u2019s claim that it is declining. Most commodities in the market have added almost 40 percent to the former prices. This is putting more pressure on the family budget, with more going to meeting the daily needs than planning for extravagant expenses this festive period,\u201d Okikioluwa said.\n\nSpeaking further, the economist said that when the bills keep growing, an average Nigerian will naturally cut down on things he thinks are ostentatious. \u201cUnfortunately, travel and expenditure for Christmas and relaxation is worst hit by such cost-cutting decisions, and that is why many are going to celebrate low-key,\u201d she said.\n\nComparing the situation now with what was the case two to three years ago, Emmanuel Emordi, a chartered accountant and chief financial officer of a Lagos-based five-star hotel, noted that prices of goods have quadrupled, transport fare tripled and insecurity worsened now than it was three years ago.\n\nAccording to him, the high cost and high risk of travel now, the inflation and the health challenges are reasons many who will always travel are staying back and even celebrating low-key.\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend again. The cost, the risk, the pandemic, January burden; including school fees and house rent are making it difficult for people to celebrate Christmas and New Year elaborately. We are still hiding, covering our faces with masks and keeping to health and safety protocols. So, celebration time can wait until good times come again,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Luke Okoli, an indigene of Enugu Agidi, in Anambra State, who has several family engagements this festive period, is relying on relatives who are travelling with their cars to cut costs.\n\n\u201cWe all cannot stay back in the town during the festive period no matter how bad the economy is. Even during lockdown people travelled. Many town unions and family meetings are hiring commercial buses to lessen the burden of transport for their members who want to travel but do not have the means this Christmas. So, people should look for such opportunities,\u201d Okoli suggested.\n\nLooking at Okoli\u2019s suggestion critically, Segun Adekunle, a pharmacist who lost two shops to the #ENDSARS protests, argued that many have lost their jobs and a lot of families are passing through hardship, hence people at home should understand and bear with them this time.\n\nI am from Kwara State and I always visit my in-laws at Auchi almost every Christmas, but they heard and felt the calamity that befell my business during the #EndSARS protests. So, everybody knows things are hard and should adjust their travel expenses even this Christmas,\u201d Adekunle said.\n\nGenerally, low-key festivity is expected this year as the pandemic is still much around coupled with the fact that insecurity abound in some of the places people usually travel for comfort in the past.\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent, Tunde Mogaji, a media consultant, said: \u201cThe low purchasing power among Nigerians and high cost of things are really big issues in the country now. Can you imagine Chicken being sold for N8,000, not because the sellers want to make a massive profit but because the cost of feed is very expensive in the market.\n\n\u201cGo and price rice or beans and hear the prices in the market. I don\u2019t know where we are going in the country now; a lot of people would not be able to survive again.\u201d\n\nMogaji urged President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently set up a presidential task force or committee to study the situation and provide solutions to the escalating food prices.\n\n\u201cThe fear now is who can afford N8,000 or N10,000 to buy a live Chicken. Go and check the price of gas too. It is going up every day. I just believe there should be some level of government intervention or subsidy.\n\n\u201cI mean they should investigate what is causing this arbitrary increase in prices of food items. Food security is something President Buhari should take seriously by setting up a task force to tackle the situation.\n\n\u201cPart of it could be caused by the crisis in Northern Nigeria; people are not farming like before, even those farming are scared to take their food down South due to insecurity,\u201d he said.\n\nKunle Okunade, a public affairs analyst, said he was not surprised about the current high cost of staple foods across Nigeria as it is usually the situation during the festive period, adding that the situation has been worsened by the bad economy in the country presently.\n\nOkunde stressed that Nigeria was experiencing hyper-inflation which needs urgent government intervention.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is never a new thing in Nigeria that whenever it is yuletide season, prices of goods would also go up. The truth is that the economy has collapsed and there is hyperinflation in the country. The hyper-inflation would definitely make the cost of living high and purchasing power will be low.\n\n\u201cThis is the period the government needs to step in to ensure citizens are not overcharged and put in place regulations. Having said this, many Nigerians may not be able to celebrate the season as they are supposed to consider the socio-economic situation of the country, currently.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore now, there should have been several economic stimuli that would create succour for the people ahead of Yuletide,\u201d he further said.",
          "summary": "The worst still is that many are not going to celebrate Christmas and New Year the way they used to; there is no purchasing power to do so.\nIn the same vein, Gbemi Okikioluwa, an economist and banker, decried that the purchasing power of many is very low now and that many will celebrate Christmas without the usual fanfare of traditional Christmas rice and killing of the fattest chicken, goat or cow.\nThe cost, the risk, the pandemic, January burden; including school fees and house rent are making it difficult for people to celebrate Christmas and New Year elaborately.\nSpeaking to our correspondent, Tunde Mogaji, a media consultant, said: \u201cThe low purchasing power among Nigerians and high cost of things are really big issues in the country now.\nThe hyper-inflation would definitely make the cost of living high and purchasing power will be low.",

          "title": "\u2018FG must take tough decisions to resolve Nigeria\u2019s security crisis\u2019",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has been advised to take tough decisions to end the high level of insecurity in the country, particularly in parts of the North. Some concerned Nigerians, who spoke to BusinessDay, said the rate at which Nigerians lose their lives to bandits paints a picture of a nation without leadership. A Public Affairs Analyst and Lawyer, Idowu Omolegan blamed the Buhari administration and security agencies for not doing enough to stem the killings despite the availability of enough intelligence at their disposal, urging them to take decisive action to end the scourge. \u201cI know the insecurity situation in Nigeria did not start today, but obviously, things have degenerated in the last seven years or so. What is happening is a failure of intelligence. I just think that the President and state governors are not doing enough to fish out these criminals, deal with them, especially with all the intelligence at their disposal,\u201d Omolegan said. According to him, \u201cWhy would a criminal gang write a letter to a community that they are coming and they still come and carry out the attack successfully? It only shows how bad things have degenerated in the country, and it also shows that there are fifth columnists among the security agencies. You can\u2019t tell me with the huge amount budgeted for military and other security agencies every year, they do not have the equipment to go into the forest and face these guys.\u201d Wale Ogunade, a lawyer and activist, alleged sabotage in the fight against the bandits. According to him, \u201cI think the President is too soft in handling this issue of security; a lot of the officers are sabotaging the work of others. They are not performing; this practice of appointing people and you can\u2019t check if they are doing well or not, is failing him. You can see what is happening, it is a shame that our people are now taking refuge in Niger, Togo and other smaller countries.\u201d Despite the efforts by the Federal Government, the spate of insecurity across Nigeria has become more pronounced and assumed a frightening proportion in the last six years. The situation has also descended to a new low that continues to threaten the unity and sovereignty of Nigeria. Apart from Boko Haram insurgency, increased attacks on worshippers, travellers and kidnapping by suspected Fulani herdsmen, terrorists and other criminal groups is leaving tales of anguish in the mouths of Nigerians. Thousands of lives have been lost, with many families displaced, many children turned orphans. Last Wednesday, members of North/South Alliance staged a demonstration in Abuja on the escalating insecurity in the northern part of the country. Tagged: \u2018#NorthisBleeding,\u2019 the protesters brandished placards with various inscriptions against President Muhammadu Buhari. The protesters complained that \u201cNorthern Nigeria is bleeding; Buhari is sleeping.\u201d Recently, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and its Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) warned that Nigeria cannot solve its security challenges with the alarming rate of unemployment, especially among the youths across the country. The unions called on the Federal Government to do all within its powers to address the high rate of unemployment in the country to have any chance of addressing the insecurity and bring about a peaceful nation, warning that Nigeria was sitting on a time bomb, with the armies of jobless youths across the country. Although the vicious attacks on local communities and kidnapping of people by criminal groups in the region is being described by state officials as banditry, experts say that further evidence suggests that the government is simplifying the dynamics and was not doing enough to curtail the situation. They say that in actuality, Northern Nigeria has become the safe haven of increasingly active terrorist groups, including the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara; Al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb; a splinter of Boko Haram popularly referred to as the Islamic State in West Africa once rated the fourth-deadliest terror group in the world. Penultimate Friday, gunmen attacked a rural village in Northern Nigeria, in Niger State, killing 16 worshippers at a mosque and kidnapping others, according to a local official. Alhassan Isah Mazakuka, the local government chairman said the assault on Ba\u2019are village in the Mashegu area of Niger State lasted for hours. The assailants, who were said to be numbering about a dozen in number, were said to have arrived on motorcycles, rampaged through the village, killing people praying at the mosque and looting. \u201cThose people (the gunmen) are dangerous,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cThey killed 16 and kidnapped many of our people. We don\u2019t even know the number they kidnapped because they are uncountable,\u201d the chairman said. Similarly, Just days after that, the Katsina State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Rabe Nasir Bindawa, was killed at his home. The Commissioner was said to have been stabbed with a knife by the hoodlums in his sitting room and his corpse was locked in his toilet. Recently, it was confirmed that 23 travellers were slain in different parts of Sokoto State. Also, last week, a member of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Rilwanu Gadagau was killed by terrorists. Gadagau\u2019s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Ibrahim Danfulan made the announcement in a statement. According to Danfulan, the late lawmaker\u2019s body was discovered in a morgue on Wednesday, adding that he was among those killed on Monday night along Kaduna-Zaria Highway. \u201cHe died during bandits\u2019 attack along Zaria highway. This is tragic and painful. We are in deep grief over this sad incident. Our prayers at this time go to his immediate family. Honorable Gadagau was a young and dynamic lawmaker, who had a passion for his constituency, state, and Nigeria. We will miss his vibrant contributions,\u201d part of the statement read. Presently, it appears there is no hope in sight; promises made by the head of security agencies to halt the killings appear to be a mirage. Observers say that Nigeria\u2019s security forces are already overstretched as they have been fighting Islamic extremists in the North for more than a decade and called for more armed men to be deployed to various states in the North. In many remote communities in Northern Nigeria, the armed groups often outnumber and outgun the security forces. Recently, a coalition of Northern youth groups under the aegis of Northern Ethnic Group Assembly, (NEYGA) condemned the killing of travellers by bandits in Isa Local Government Area of Sokoto. The spokesperson of the group, Ibrahim Dan-Musa, said it was one attack that cannot be forgotten in a hurry, lamenting that Nigeria has been turned into a killing field by terrorists terrorising the country. According to him, \u201cNigeria has been turned into a killing field by these bandits terrorising the country where innocent civilians looking for their daily bread are forced to live in perpetual fear. \u201cThe body language of Monguno (Mohammed Babagana Monguno, national security adviser) shows that he is only interested in power and more power and acquisitions of properties instead of intelligent gathering\u201d. \u201cVirtually all parts of Nigeria are currently battling with one form of insecurity or the other with various crimes going on, largely unabated.\u201d \u201cDespite attempts by the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to curb the rising criminalities and killings across the country, the nation\u2019s security apparatus under Monguno appears to be overwhelmed by criminals maiming and extorting their victims,\u201d Dan-Musa further said. In his opinion article, published on December 12, 2021 by the International Centre for Investigative Journalism, entitled, \u2018Never in the history of our nation has it been this bad,\u2019 Usman Yusuf, a professor of Haematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, lamented the precarious security situation across the country, particularly in the North. He recalled the gruesome massacre of 42 innocent travellers including women, children and babies at Gidan Bawa in Sabon Birni LGA of Sokoto State on December 6, 2021. \u201cArmed bandits ambushed and shot at their bus setting it ablaze and stood guard watching until all the passengers were burnt alive. The menacing presence of the armed bandits prevented anyone from responding to the people\u2019s screams for help,\u201d he said. He also noted the apprehension in Sokoto East, saying, \u201cSabon Birni, Isa, Goronyo, Illela and Wurno LGAs in eastern part of Sokoto state are now under the control of a notorious bandit called Bello Turji who was dislodged by recent military operations in Zamfara State. His gang is terrorizing these parts of the state and is responsible for the recent burning to death of 42 passengers in Gidan Bawa and more.\u201d According to him, \u201cResidents of these areas come under constant attacks by armed bandits, their markets and schools remain closed and farmers are scared off their farms. Bandits change the village heads and impose taxes on the villagers. There is a mass exodus of refugees into the neighboring Niger Republic. In Sabon Birni, residents say that only about 20 lightly armed soldiers were sent to fight more than 300 heavily armed bandits and that these soldiers stayed for a short time leaving them to endure lethal reprisal attacks by these bandits.\u201d Professor Yusuf alleged that the Zamfara Military Operations: Code named, \u2018Operation Hadarin Daji\u2019, was a classic case of a military operation that was poorly planned and poorly executed without any strategy on how to handle the predictable disastrous consequences. This military operation is singularly responsible for the recent upsurge of banditry in Sokoto, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger States that has cost the lives of many citizens. He noted that there are many more atrocious deeds and attacks that are being reported. \u201cThe gruesome nature of the Gidan Bawa massacre in Sokoto state made headlines but, there are many more equally as gruesome that occurred in the NW and NC that did not make the headlines. In Niger state, armed bandits killed 9 worshippers in Ba\u2019are in Mashegu LGA following a similar attack in October in Maza-Kula in the same council area where 17 worshippers were killed. In Katsina state, Batsari LGA, gunmen killed at least 11 people and injured 13 others setting dozens of houses and vehicles on fire. \u201cIn Kaduna State, the news is equally as depressing with the recent killing of a Pastor and innocent citizens in the rural areas. Kaduna-Abuja highway has now become highway to hell due to abductions by bandits. Zamfara State, the epicenter of banditry, has not seen any respite from bandit attacks who control major highways and villages operating unchecked,\u201d he said. Recall that Governor Aminu Tambuwal had recently blamed the escalation of attacks in his state on uncoordinated attack by the military against the bandits without carrying along the state governments. According to him, \u201cOur situation in Sokoto State got worsened by the military operations in Zamfara State. The operations took us by surprise. I can tell you, Mr. NSA, we the governors of the North-West have been appealing for this operation for the last four years. What we requested was that once the military is ready for the operations, it should be carried out simultaneously in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Kebbi, Sokoto and Niger states where we are having infiltration of these criminals. Unfortunately, Zamfara was isolated and this was what we got by \u2018Operation Hadarin Daji\u2019, which was carried out without any blocking force around the neighboring states, particularly speaking for Sokoto State. Also, the timing of the operation didn\u2019t help, unfortunately, our security agents do not have enough equipment to move and curtail and contain those that would wander towards Sokoto State. So, the timing and way the operation was carried out left Sokoto very vulnerable,\u201d Governor Aminu Tambuwal lamented",

          "text": "In 2010, Nonso Onyeka, a recharge card seller would be able to make up to N150,000 in revenue because the digital revolution powered by deep mobile penetration was just about taking off. People depended on him to sell physical recharge cards to stay in touch with their loved ones or conduct their businesses.\n\nToday, the rise of mobile payment which allows Nigerians to buy and sell almost anything online means that sellers like Onyeka cannot depend on physical recharge cards to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cI make N10 on a N200 recharge voucher and less depending on the value of the voucher. I had to add provisions and snacks to support myself as the recharge card business started slowing down,\u201d he told BusinessDay.\n\nAccording to Nonso who has been in the business for over seventeen years, they used to be over forty selling airtime at Apapa Barracks, however, they are now about six.\n\nThe adoption of the digital method of recharging phones has led to a huge reduction in the sales of recharge vouchers by airtime vendors, leading to some quitting while others add other ventures to their recharge card business.\n\nTo move with the digital trends of recharging airtime, Nonso had decided to get a PoS. However, he has been unable to get one promised to him for about five months.\n\nRead more Illegal betting markets yield $1.7tr revenue annuallY\n\nAs a result of convenience, people now adopt the digital form of buying airtime compared to some years back when Nigerians had to buy scratch cards and paper cards to credit their phones. This is done via various channels such as Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Bank apps, ATM, and POS.\n\nFor Mama Chichi who has been in the business for over ten years, her own story is different. She says the business is still going well as she gets a lot of Customers who buy recharge cards from her.\n\nHowever, she stated that one of the challenges she faces with the recharge card business is, sometimes when a customer buys the airtime which is on paper, they recharge it and get an error code which says \u201cthe airtime has been previously used\u201d, after which she will have to refund the customer.\n\nIn a phone interview with Olugbenga Hammed, Manager, Go-To-Market, MTN Nigeria, 53 percent of airtime revenue comes from digital channels, while 47 percent comes from paper recharge cards.\n\nThis shows that the leading telecommunication company, MTN, has more customers recharging their phones via digital channels compared to paper recharge cards.\n\nAccording to Hammed, the paper recharge card attracts more cost for the company compared to the digital form of recharging. These costs include printing, distribution, among others. This is one of the reasons digital channels are more profitable for the company compared to paper recharge cards.\n\nOlusola Teniola, Vice President of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) said the country has quite a number of subscribers making use of alternative channels to recharge because of convenience.\n\nAccording to Teniola, \u201cThe adoption of the digital form of recharging can be seen more in major cities in the country, such as Abuja, Lagos, Port-Harcourt, Kano because these states have the highest population in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUsing Lagos for example, the UN-Habitat and international development agencies estimate the Lagos state population to be over 24 million population as of 2018. This population covers the population of five other states in the country. Kano which is the second-highest has over 16 million and Oyo state which has over 15 million. While in the remaining 32 states, there is a larger percentage making use of paper recharge vouchers.\n\nKanayo, who was sitting underneath a Recharge card seller\u2019s umbrella, told BusinessDay that he prefers to recharge online than buy the recharge card (on paper) due to the convenience that comes with it.\n\n\u201cI prefer to buy on my phone through my bank because at that moment I won\u2019t feel that I\u2019m spending my money to buy airtime and some other times I don\u2019t have cash, so it\u2019s easy to just buy directly from the bank,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Lady Adanma Okpara: Eastern Nigeria Amazon Embarks on Her Final Journey Home",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nAfter 99 long years of consequential life clothed with strength and dignity, Mrs. Adanma Okpara, former Eastern Nigeria\u2019s First Lady and wife of Dr. Michael Iheonukara Okpara, who served as Premier of the region between 1959 and 1966, marked her final journey home on Saturday when her remains were committed to mother earth.\n\nLady Adanma who passed away on August 22, after an illness, 37 years after her husband\u2019s death in 1984, was laid to rest next to her husband at a mausoleum in their compound after a burial service at Williams Memorial Secondary School, Afugiri, Ohuhu, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State, in an event that marked an end to an era.\n\nShe was the first of two Amazons to exit the stage, the other, wife Nigeria\u2019s first military head of state, Aguiyi Ironsi, Mrs. Victoria Aguiyi-Ironsi, also an Umuahia woman following up on August 23, at age 97; two women of substance who demonstrated utmost strength of character even in most difficult circumstances, and went on to live lives defined by longevity and great impact.\n\nLady Adanma\u2019s was a noble life crowned with \u2018heroic\u2019 death, having graciously worn the crown of old age, with associated wisdom for many years. But her heroism doesn\u2019t lie in her longevity. Lady Adanma lived a life full of many accomplishments; set a standard in hard work and dedication, and proved an invaluable pillar of support, not just to her young family after losing her husband in 1984, but her entire community and indeed for many in the country.\n\nBut when her story is told in full, it will be mostly about how she, as First Lady, proved to be a source of strength to her husband who in 1959, at age 39, began shouldering responsibility of leading the young Eastern Region of Nigeria; an idyllic region just sprawling into civilization, comprising of today\u2019s Southeast and much South South geopolitical zones.\n\nDr. Okpara was, in his day, a fiery charismatic politician whose firebrand approach to politics earned the nickname \u201cM.I Power.\u201d But although the young medical doctor had been an integral part of the Zikist Movement, a radical wing of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), that was prominent in the struggle for Nigeria\u2019s independence, and had following the grant of internal self-rule to the country in 1952, been elected into the Eastern Nigerian House of Assembly, even as he went on to hold various cabinet positions \u2013 including Minister of Health and Minister of Agriculture and Production \u2013 in the region before 1959, it would still have been a big responsibility on his young shoulders when he stepped into Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe\u2019s shoes as Premier, following Dr. Azikiwe\u2019s elevation to the office of Governor-General.\n\nHowever, Dr. Okpara had a secret weapon in Lady Adanma, then a 37-year-old teacher, who readily stepped up to the responsibility of guiding her husband. And by the time the military coup of 1966 brought an abrupt end to their leadership, they had completed a revolution in the region, taking it from a largely agrarian locality to the fast industrializing space that had become the fastest growing, economically, in the World.\n\n\u201cShe was the pillar behind my father\u2019s success as the Premier of Eastern Nigeria, which was the fastest growing economy in the world then,\u201d remarked her second son, Uzodinma. \u201cShe lived full and accomplished life. She was a politician and campaigned with her husband and was a great mobiliser of men and women, and a philanthropist.\u201d\n\nPius Okigbo, an eminent economist and elder brother of renowned poet, Christopher Okigbo, who served as economic adviser to the government in Lagos, then federal capital, recorded that, in an address in Madras India, Dr. Okpara wowed the world with his programme of industrial and agricultural revolutions anchored in the innovative farm settlement scheme. Time was when Nigeria had great people in leadership.\n\nA strong advocate for what he called \u201cpragmatic socialism,\u201d with a firm belief that agricultural reform was crucial to the developmental aspirations of the region and Nigeria in general, Okpara provided purposeful leadership, setting a standard in governance that remains unmatched six decades later.\n\nHe presided over a leadership anchored on agricultural revolution and industrialisation, and embarked on ambitious developmental projects which came to be known as the \u2018Okpara Revolution.\u2019 These found expression in the massive plantations, farm settlements and industrial clusters that dotted the region. There were the Enamel Ware Factory, Port Harcourt; Hotel Presidential in Enugu and Port Harcourt; Aba Textile Mills; Sunray Four Mill, Port Harcourt; Vehicle Assembly Plant, Port Harcourt; Modern Ceramic Factory, Umuahia; Catering Rest House and Modern Shoe factory, Owerri; Nkalagu Cement Factory; Nigerian Breweries plant in Aba; Tobacco and Glass-making Plant in Port Harcourt, among others.\n\nYet, besides these established factories, foundations were also laid for Calabar Cement Factory, Onitsha Textile Mill, Permatex Spinning and Weaving Company, Enugu, while Cashew and palm oil plantations as well as extension farms sprang up in different parts of the region.\n\nIn all these accomplishments, Lady Adanma was very instrumental. A true definition of strong woman, she held the fort at the home front and gave useful pieces of advice and counsel to her husband in critical periods, as has been attested to by all who are familiar with the family.\n\n\u201cThe spousal support she provided to her late husband was instrumental to the monumental success he recorded as Premier,\u201d Abia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu in condolence message when she passed away in August. \u201cWidowed since December 1984, Lady Okpara remained a model of good and excellent womanhood. She was a fountain of knowledge from which most women, especially, here in Abia, drank freely.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the former First Lady remained at her husband\u2019s house in Umuegwu, Ohuhu, Umuahia and continued to play the role of a mother, grandmother and community leader till her final days.\n\nIndeed, Lady Adanma as First Lady, epitomized humility, simplicity and dedication. She shunned the flamboyance and publicity that is the hallmark of first ladyship today, and went about her business with dignity, which her background as a teacher, a profession then typified by discipline, perhaps predisposed her to.\n\nShe was the true definition virtuous woman. She never craved attention, as she went about impacting lives, even as she lived a modest life, ensuring that her husband did not steal from the public purse, what would have been an oddity in today\u2019s Nigeria.\n\nIt is remarkable that the family never owned a house of their own while in government. Indeed, when Dr. Okpara left office, the only landed property he owned was one uncompleted building at Ogui Road in Enugu. There was no house in his home town Ohuhu in Abia State. When the Nigerian Civil War ended in 1970, he went into exile in Ireland, and it was only upon his return in 1979 that his close associates and beneficiaries took up a collection to build him a house in his village. There he would live until his death in 1984, and there Lady Adanma lived till she passed on, too.\n\nLady Adanma set a standard on many fronts: In leadership, humility, discipline dedication, she was never found wanting.\n\n\u201cLady Adanma and Victoria Aguiyi-Ironsi represented an era of self-sacrifice in public service as they were always held up as beacons to women in leadership,\u201d noted Dr. Nkechi Ikpeazu, wife of Abia governor, Okezie. \u201cTheir lives were momentous and though they would be sorely missed, they have left legacies worth introspecting, studying, emulating and replicating.\u201d\n\nMrs. Ikpeazu said she is one of many wives of governors and heads of State who had, over the past five decades, received mentorship from the two women, noting that enjoyed the privilege of learning a lot about honour, humility, and self-respect from their lifestyles and stewardships.\n\nCertainly, today\u2019s first ladies have a lot to learn from the examples set by Lady Adanma, who even after losing her husband, continued to render selfless service to the church and humanity.\n\n\u201cAfter our father died in 1984; that is 39 years after, she lived a fully accomplished life,\u201d said Uzodinma who further explained that after the death of her husband, \u201cShe carried on with her community service where she helped people up to few days before she died.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s commitment to service to humanity acknowledged by Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari in a condolence message to the family.\n\n\u201cAs a recipient of several awards and honours from faith-based and humanitarian organisations, President Buhari affirms that the late wife of the very formidable figure in the First Republic and the Eastern Nigeria, led by example even after leaving public office,\u201d said the president in a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\nThe president described her an enterprising and disciplined mother, who was a worthy example of humility and hard work to her children and the many women she mentored in her community.",

Adopted in 2012, this strategy combines local stocks, national stocks and a Regional Food Security Reserve (RFSR) to ensure regional solidarity in the event of a major food crisis in the region.\n\nThe 8 million euro and 3-year AFD support to ECOWAS aims to increase the region\u2019s readiness to manage food, nutrition and pastoral crises with a variety of causes.

Selection and disbursement 18th/19th and the press release should by 20th Dec.\n\n\u201c1,234 responded; 852 without orphanage names; 382 with orphanage names.\n\n\u201cThe national association of orphanages in Nigeria sent the list of orphanage homes within their coverage, which to some extent, is helping us in the verification process.

          "text": "Economic experts have attributed the decline in Nigeria\u2019s external reserves to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s intervention to stabilise the naira and the recent collapse in global oil prices, among other factors.\n\nThe nation\u2019s external reserves fell by $440m in two weeks from $41.15bn at the start of this month, according to the latest data from the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe experts, who spoke with our correspondent in separate interviews on Saturday, noted that the external reserves were mostly determined by the revenue from oil exports.\n\nThe reserves, which dropped by $610m in November from $41.83bn on October 29, declined further to $40.71bn as of December 15.\n\nThe CBN data showed that the reserves, which had gained $5bn in October, returned to a downward path in November.\n\nThe reserves increased from $36.78bn on September 30 to $41.83bn as of October 29.\n\nWhen contacted by our correspondent, the spokesperson for the CBN, Mr Osita Nwanisobi, declined to comment on the recent fall in the reserves.\n\nThe naira has continued its downward trend in recent weeks at the parallel market.\n\nBureau de Change operators, who spoke to our correspondent, said they bought the dollar at N565 and sold it for N569 on Saturday.\n\nThree weeks earlier, the dollar was bought and sold for N550 and N555.\n\nThe BDC operators linked the fall in the value of the naira to an increase in the demand for the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe fluctuation in global oil prices is part of the problem, and they use the reserves to support the naira; that is why we are having that problem. You know the oil revenue determines the reserves,\u201d said the Chairman of the Foundation for Economic Research and Training, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nForeign portfolio investors withdrawing funds \u2013 Ukpong.\n\nA professor of Financial Economics, Leo Ukong, noted that the international oil benchmark, Brent crude, had plunged to about $71 per barrel from over $80 per barrel.\n\nUkpong, who is also the Dean of the School of Business and Entrepreneurship, American University of Nigeria, Yola, said, \u201cOur number one source of external reserves is the sales of crude oil.\n\n\u201cWhat changes from day to day is the price of crude oil. When crude oil price goes up, you will see our reserves also increasing because the price is in our favour; when the price of crude oil comes down, you will also see that our reserves will tend to follow suit.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the oil price, for the past one and a half month, it was above $80 before November. As of today, it is around $71. Between August and September, the crude oil price was rising.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has been involved in a lot of foreign bonds, which the country\u2019s accounting system regards as an inflow of foreign currencies, even though they are debts.\n\nUkpong said this made the external reserves seemed to be doing well in recent months when there was a rise in the reserves.\n\nHe noted that those buying crude oil had slowed down because the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 affected economic activities in many countries.\n\n\u2018Mature trade obligations putting pressure on reserves\u2019\n\nAn economist and Chief Executive Officer of Cowry Asset Management Limited, Mr Johnson Chukwu, linked the sharp and continued decline in the external reserves to high demand for the dollar.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN is honouring mature trade obligations and this has expectedly led to the fall in the foreign exchange reserves.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN is honouring matured trade obligations. Also, remember that the Governor, Godwin Emefiele, had given a timeline to ensure that matured portfolio remittances are honoured. So, I believe this is what is happening.

          "title": "Fresh $5.8bn Loan: SERAP Writes Buhari, Seeks \u2018Moratorium\u2019 On Borrowing",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201cissue an immediate moratorium on borrowing by the Federal Government and the 36 states to address a systemic debt crisis, prevent retrogressive economic measures, and the disproportionately negative impact of unsustainable debt on the poor Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe request followed the recent approval by the National Assembly of President Buhari\u2019s request for a $5.8bn loan and grant of $10bn. Previous approvals in 2021 alone include $8.3bn; \u20ac490m, and $6.1bn. The foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 states, and Federal Capital Territory reportedly stands at $37.9bn.\n\nIn an open letter dated 18 December 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cA moratorium on borrowing would create a temporary debt standstill, and free up fiscal space for investment in Nigerians\u2019 needs, as well as ensure sustainable economic and social recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cWithout a moratorium on borrowing, your government and many of the 36 states may be caught in a process-driven mostly by creditors\u2019 needs. This will result in an exorbitant social cost for the marginalized and vulnerable sectors of the population.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Arik Air Flight Delayed In Asaba Over \u2018Face-Mask\u2019 Row\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cLong-term unsustainable debt can be a barrier to the government\u2019s ability to mobilize resources for human rights, and may lead to taxes and user fees that impact negatively on vulnerable and marginalised Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cSERAP is concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of the loans so far obtained, and opacity around the terms and conditions, including repayment details of these loans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the National Assembly has asked for these details in future loan requests, it ought to have seen and assessed the terms and conditions of these loans before approving them, in line with its oversight responsibility under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended].\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not urgently addressed, the escalating borrowing and looming debt crisis would cripple the ability of both the Federal Government and the 36 states to deliver essential public services such as quality healthcare, education, and clean water to the most vulnerable and marginalised sectors of the population.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that governments\u2019 ability to protect human rights is inextricably related to the ability to spend needed resources. Growing debt burdens and debt repayment difficulties will have negative impacts on the ability of your government and many of the 36 states to fulfill the basic socio-economic rights of poor and vulnerable Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cSustainable debt management by the Federal Government and state governments will contribute to mobilizing resources for human rights and essential public services, and promote a culture of responsible borrowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and many of the 36 states would seem to be in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress. According to reports, the Senate and House of Representatives recently approved the loans of $5,803,364,553.50 and a grant component of $10m under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis followed previous approvals this year by the National Assembly of $16.2 (16,230,077,718) billion loan; \u20ac1 (1,020,000,000) million and a grant component of $125 million loan; $36.8 billion, \u20ac910 million loans, and a grant component of $10 million; $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans; $6.1 billion, $1.5 billion and 995 million loans; and $4(4,054,476,863), \u20ac710 million and grant component of $125 million.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral of the 36 states are also facing a debt crisis, and vicious debt cycles. According to the Debt Management Office, the foreign debt stock of the Federal Government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory presently stands at $37.9bn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe loans from China alone amount to $3.59bn. According to the UN Independent Expert on foreign debt and human rights, Nigeria faces debt service relative to tax revenues that exceed 20 per cent, with escalating social tensions linked to poverty and inequality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe growing level of borrowing by your government and the 36 states is clearly a human rights issue because when the entire country is burdened by unsustainable debts, there will be little money left to ensure access of poor and vulnerable Nigerians to basic public services.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it is critical for the Federal Government and state governments to have sufficient resources to fund their budgets, it is equally critical for governments to substantially cut the cost of governance. Persistent borrowing is neither sustainable nor fair to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to conduct a human rights assessment of the borrowing by governments since 1999 to address the dire consequences of unsustainable debts on people and communities across the country, and to ensure that borrowing at all levels of government considers the human rights impacts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny such assessment should be conducted in harmony with existing safeguards and mechanisms in order to contribute to informed decision-making and to complement findings from a human rights perspective.\u201d\n\n\u201cA human rights impact analysis should serve to ascertain the debts that can be repaid, and the resources necessary to ensure compliance with the obligation of using the maximum available resources for the protection and fulfillment of human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted, States parties including Nigeria are under an obligation to devote their maximum available resources to the full realization of all economic and social rights, including the rights to health, education, and water.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to adopt effective measures to address transparency and accountability gaps in spending of loans, and the systemic and widespread corruption in ministries, departments, and agencies, as documented by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would therefore be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government and the 36 states to comply with our requests.\u201d",

          "text": "The Debt Management Office (DMO) has clarified that loans from China to Nigeria, which presently stood at $3.59billion were largely concessional as no national asset was tagged as collateral.\n\nThe Director-General of DMO, Ms Patience Oniha, who made this known in an interview om Saturday, also disclosed that the loan constitutes only 9.4 per cent of the country\u2019s total foreign debt stock of $37.9 billion.\n\nIn recent times, both the social and mainstream media have been awash with news about some African countries, including Nigeria, facing the threat of losing some critical national assets to the Asian country due to high-level indebtedness.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s total debt stock as at September 30 was $37.9 billion; this figure comprised the external debt stock of the federal government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\n\u201cBut total loans from China stands at $3.59 billion, which is 9.47 per cent of the total external debt. The loans did not require any national asset as collateral; they were largely concessional,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha urged Nigerians to always endeavour to verify sensitive information from official sources before disseminating it.\n\nShe explained that before foreign loans were contracted, very sensitive steps were taken by multiple institutions of government to ensure that they were beneficial to the nation.\n\n\u201cBefore any foreign loan is contracted, including the issuance of Eurobond, they are approved by the Federal Executive Council and thereafter, the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAn important and extremely critical step is that the loan agreements are approved by the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cAn opinion is issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice before the agreements are signed.\n\n\u201cSeveral measures which operate seamlessly have been put in place to ensure that data on debt are available and that debt is serviced as at when due. Provisions are made explicitly for debt service in the annual budgets,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nOniha explained that the loans agreements provided a number of steps to take to resolve dispute when they arise.\n\n\u201cThe first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails, they go to arbitration.\n\n\u201cIn other words, a lender, in this case, China, would not just pounce on an asset at the first sign of a dispute, including defaults,\u2019\u2019 the she said.\n\nShe explained that the DMO maintained proper records of debts, provided projections for debt service and processed the actual payments for debt service.\n\nShe pointed out that those functions were carried out in conjunction with the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nFestus Akanbi",

Yet, no one has been arrested.\n\n\u201cThe roads have become booby traps where the citizenry are scared to travel on, for the fear that they may be kidnapped for ransom or in some cases killed outrightly. It is an open secret that no one is safe in this country any longer.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the security architecture in the country has collapsed and the citizens now live in fear.\n\n\u201cThe president should not listen to sycophants who may not be telling him the truth that all is well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll is not well with Nigeria right now, Mr. President. You must therefore take urgent steps now to pull the nation back from the precipice before it is too late.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged every citizen not to sit on the fence but join hands with governments at all levels as patriots to assist in redeeming the nation from the hands of bloodthirsty terrorists so that Nigeria can gradually move into political stability and economic prosperity for all.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has called on the Turkey-Africa Partnership Summit to provide concrete support to help defeat terrorism and insurgency on the African continent.\n\nThe president who made the call while speaking at the third edition of the summit in Istanbul, Turkey, on Saturday admitted that the Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and degraded by Nigeria\u2019s defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, also on Saturday again drew the attention of Buhari to the fact Nigeria is collapsing due to terrorists\u2019 activities.\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed delight that the Summit convened by Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has given due consideration to the issue of terrorism, while also focusing on development and infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThis is coming as Erdogan has stated that Turkey would send 15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to Africa, adding that the low vaccination rates there was a blot on humanity.\n\nBuhari advised that the partnership should also focus on the global challenge of climate change which is impacting Nigeria, Turkey, and indeed the world at large.\n\nAccording to him, it has become a catalyst for conflict through food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe trend is the same around the world where communities are overwhelmed by forest fires, rising sea levels, flood, drought, and desertification. I want to seize this opportunity to appeal for support for initiatives such as Africa\u2019s Great Green Wall on Environment and Land Management, which is designed to fight the effects of climate change and desertification in Africa. The initiative aims to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land in the 11 countries of the Sahel-Sahara strip, capture 250 million tons of carbon and, create 10 million green jobs by 2030.\u201d\n\nOn the global coronavirus pandemic, Buhari urged nations to follow the example of Africa-Turkey cooperation, which emphasises solidarity and support in tackling the challenge.\n\nThe president noted that given the increasingly unpredictable nature of contemporary global challenges facing mankind, world leaders must continue to put the wellbeing of humanity at the centre of the agenda for the common good and prosperity of all.\n\nWhile applauding President Erdogan for initiating the Turkey-Africa Partnership in 2008, Buhari urged the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCTA) to assist in further increasing the level of Africa-Turkey trade, leading to a win-win for all countries.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The pandemic is a global challenge which calls for global solidarity and solutions and the Africa-Turkey cooperation model has proved to be an example to the world. Not only has there been mutual support to respond to the pandemic but also mutual support to build resilience and sustainable development in other sectors. We also commend the African Union for the excellent role it has been playing in coordinating the implementation process of the Partnership. We must therefore promote science, technology, and innovation and share knowledge from research and development to better equip us to address present and future challenges more equitably and sustainably.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Nigeria strongly endorses the Summit Declaration as well as the 2022-2026 Joint Action Plan. We are confident that given the level of openness, trust and commitment manifested in the Africa\u2013Turkey Partnership, this cooperation mechanism will be a game-changer for our countries and set us on the path of sustainable development for our peoples\u201d\n\nDejo Elumoye",
