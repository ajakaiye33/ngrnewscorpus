Igboayaka on Saturday while addressing newsmen in Owerri, Imo State.\n\nThe group said the scrupulous elements in IPOB have equipped some gangsters to unleash mayhem in Igbo land, engaging in kidnapping, robbery, using the sit-at-home protest.\n\nOYC said it came to this conclusion after conducting what he described as classified security details on IPOB activities since the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu in Kenya.\n\nThe Igbo group alleged that the plan of the saboteurs is to ensure Mazi Nnamdi Kanu dies in the custody of the Department of State Security (DSS) otherwise suffer a prolonged Judicial trial.\n\nThe OYC claimed some cliques among the leaders of IPOB have conspired to hijack IPOB leadership for their selfish motives\u201d\n\n\u201cSome cliques at the corridor of power in IPOB are deliberately and craftily dishing out ideas and plans that are counterproductive for ill-motive to frustrate the legal fight of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyers. These cliques of power mongers are not happy with the legal doggedity of Barr. Ejiofor and Barr.

What matters most to them is as far they feast fat on the treasury of IPOB Nnamdi Kanu can die or remain in detention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Council, therefore, urged dogged apostles IPOB to remain resolute and not deviate from the actual goal, hence the actualisation of self-determination, while reiterating the need to \u201cchange any approach that may indict Mazi Nnamdi Kanu before the oppressors, stressing that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is coming out from detention victoriously\u201d\n\nOYC further said nothing is hidden under the sun, those behind this evil sinister in IPOB if continued will be exposed they shall not escape the edge sword of justice.\n\nNnamdi Kanu built cult of gangsters, not speaking for Igbos \u2013 IPOB founder, Emekesiri",

HK), in May 2019, converted the aggregate sum of $7,069,000; \u00a31 million and \u20ac80,000, part of proceeds of fraud.\n\nTheir offence was contrary to Sections 18 (a), 15 (2)(d) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2015 and punishable under section 15(3) of the same Act.\n\nUwujaren disclosed that Koudeih approached the prosecution for a plea bargain and that EFCC, through its counsel Rotimi Oyedepo, filed the agreement with an amended charge on September 8, 2021.\n\nDelivering judgment, Justice Ringim sent Koudeih to prison but gave him an option N1 milllion fine.\n\nHe ordered forfeiture of HK\u2019s N100 million in a bank account owned by CHK Property Investment Ltd; Mercedes Benz GLE43; two iPhones and an HP Desktop computer to the Federal Government.\n\nIn his letter, Oyewole told the EFCC that nowhere in any of the charges against Koudeih was Mompha mentioned nor found to be an accomplice.\n\nThe lawyer informed the commission that Mompha has never been convicted of any crime in Nigeria even though he faces charges on offences bordering on operating a Bureau de Change (BDC) without a licence.\n\n\u201cIt is embarrassing that an organisation of EFCC\u2019s level would hastily defame a suspect, who to their knowledge is being prosecuted by the organisation and has not been convicted of any crime known to law in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that the organisation through its image maker Wilson Uwajaren retract the blanket statement against our client forthwith and with the same publicity as was given to his previous press release on the matter.\n\n\u201cIf you fail to heed the request of our client within 14 days of the receipt of this letter, we shall be constrained to proceed to the court of law against your organisation for exemplary damages for injurious falsehood\u201d, the letter added.\n\nFBI probe: EFCC denies advising Mompha amid Hushpuppi\u2019s trial",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of an Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan on Friday awarded N20billion exceptional and aggravated damages against the Federal Government and the Department of State Security (DSS) in a case of fundamental human rights instituted by the Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe court also granted all the 16 reliefs sought by Igboho, through his counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), and awarded additional cost of N2million against the respondents jointly and in favour of Igboho. The reliefs included a restraining order for the Federal Government and security agencies not to intimidate, harass and freeze Igboho\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nThe three respondents in the case with number M/435/2021 are Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), as the first respondent, as well as SSS as second respondent and Director of SSS in Oyo State as third respondent.\n\nIgboho had demanded N500billion as reparation for damages to his property, such as his house and exotic cars that include Mercedes Benz G-Class and 2019 Lexus Car during the invasion of his residence at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State in the early hours of Thursday July 1, 2021 by DSS operatives.\n\nJustice Akintola had adjourned the case for either ruling or judgment, saying the case would be for ruling if the preliminary objections raised by the three respondents in the case succeeded, but would be for judgment if the objections failed.\n\nDeciding the preliminary objection yesterday, the court held that it did not find merit in the objection by the first respondent, who argued through his counsel, Abdullahi Abubakar, that the court lacked jurisdiction among other things to entertain the case.\n\nIn the main suit, Justice Akintola held that the reckless and indiscriminate shooting undertaken by the second and third respondents and their agents, which resulted in the death of two persons in Igboho\u2019s house, was in itself, a threat to the life of the applicant. He added that nobody shoots guns in order to entertain people. Such a conduct, the court held, has a serious potential of killing the victim, and at best constituting a serious threat to the life of the victim.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of any evidence that Nigeria was in a state of war, the style and procedure adopted by the second and third respondents and their agents in this case, is highly condemnable, reprehensible, crude and most unprofessional,\u201d the court said.\n\nJustice Akintola held further that with the benefit of hindsight, given the number of guns, arms allegedly recovered from the Igboho\u2019s premises on the fateful night, relative to the harm, damage and deaths, plus trauma inflicted on, not only the applicant, his households, guests, and neighbourhood, \u201cit is very doubtful if it worth the exercise at all.\u201d\n\nAccording to the court, it was not only the applicant that would have been traumatised by the overzealous and recklessness of the second and third respondents and their agents, the entire neighbourhood of the applicant\u2019s residence was thrown into serious squabbles and troubles.\n\n\u201cThe style adopted by the second and third respondents in the case should be condemned in strongest possible terms, especially even the fact that they are maintained by the Nigerian taxpayers. And yet they did not hesitate to unleash such mayhem on a Nigerian citizen, who has not been pronounced guilty of any crime by any court of the land,\u201d Justice Akintola said.\n\nThe court also stated that if the identity of individual agent of the second and third respondents that undertook this most bizarre and horrendous operation was known they would have been held liable for the serious infraction.\n\nCounsel to Igboho, Alliyu described the judgment as a victory for democracy in an interview with journalists after the court session, while counsel to Malami, Abdullahi Abubakar, declined an interview with journalists who wanted to know if his client would challenge the judgment at the Court of Appeal. But counsel to second and third respondents, T.A. Nurudeen, was not in court.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Rev Chris Christian, Founder and Shepherd, Locust Army International: Why i\u2019m still a virgin at 56",
          "text": "In a country where there is a craze for private jets and materialism, Chris Christian has remained a sacred eunuch with an oath of poverty. The Shepherd or G.O. of Locust Army International, a church with many branches in Nigeria, Africa and worldwide, has no property to his name due to an oath. He does not have a wife at 56, and has no ambition in the future for any. The author of over 200 bestsellers spoke to HENRY AKUBUIRO in the church premises, Ajah, Lagos, where he addressed some topical issues facing the Nigerian church even as he gave reasons for his decision never to get married or have sexual relations with other challenges threatening the nation.\n\nThe recent death of Prophet T. B. Joshua has continued to draw contrasting reactions from sections of the Nigerian Christian community. Reverend Chris Okotie said T.B Joshua wasn\u2019t a genuine man of God, while Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere, better known as Odumeje or Indaboski denounced Okotie for his unrelenting stand. So who determines a real man of God?\n\nThere are principles to take into consideration. The Bible is a principled book. Because of the way the Pentecostal is, we don\u2019t have many knowledgeable preachers in Nigeria, and there is a lot of liberty. The church is not being censored by anybody on who should become a pastor. Therefore, a lot of people who are not qualified to be pastors are into pastoral work. As a result of that, there are numerous misunderstandings. They don\u2019t even think about the conditions, those principles that should qualify a man of God. The parameters they are using to measure who is a man of God in Nigeria are not actually the parameters.\n\nWhat are the parameters?\n\nGod is His Word and there are other principles that should make a genuine man of God. For instance, God cannot be monopolised. If you say you are a prophet and He is talking to you, He cannot only talk to one individual. So when one person is saying, \u201cGod said\u2026 \u201c, the person should allow what he said God said to be censored. Apart from being censored, there should be a kindred spirit. When Jesus came to the world, his ministry wasn\u2019t accepted by the Jews. But, at least, he recognised John the Baptist. So the messiahnism of the Sovereign Servant that Jesus accomplished was acceptable to John. So somebody should not say he is one tree in the forest.\n\nSo was Chris Okotie right in his criticisms?\n\nI was expecting you to ask me whether TB Joshua was right. I am not a judge, but I am thinking that, if TB Joshua was dead, whether he was right or wrong, he should be left alone.\n\nDon\u2019t you think T. B. Joshua\u2019s death has left a big vacuum in Nigeria?\n\nAll of us were surprised he died. Whether you like him or not, he influenced this country. That doesn\u2019t mean I am saying he is from God (laughs). But it\u2019s not possible to deny him that impact.\n\nWhen you said he influenced Nigeria, what exactly do you mean?\n\nIf you look at the tourism red light, many nations identified with the Synagogue. But I think people should be very careful, because Godliness is a mystery. We can\u2019t know everything. That\u2019s why some people should be guided not to say some things straight. There are some things that cannot be said straight. Somebody said when T. B. Joshua was about to be buried, an angel appeared, and some people disagreed. Look at that!\n\nProphet Odumeje said Chris Okotie had never performed any miracle in his life, but he had chosen to rubbish a prophet like T. B. Joshua who performed multiple miracles all over the world?\n\nA lot of things are spoken out of ignorance. It is not only through miracles that impact is made in the church. There are big ministries that miracle is not part of their calling. There are those who are just teachers. There are announcers. There are prophets who announce God\u2019s projects or programmes; they are not into healing. There are prophets. So people shouldn\u2019t see miracle work as the only arm of success. For instance, when John the Baptist came, he wasn\u2019t into miracle work. But Jesus testified that no one was greater than him. A ministry can be successful without that part. Sometimes you find it difficult to separate that part from witchcraft. Sometimes you are not sure of the source of that power, especially if it is separated from the Word. The Bible tells us there should be learning before power. There should be knowledge. As I often say, power is a projection of wisdom. So when somebody does not have knowledge and he is doing a lot of miracles, you should look at that being magical, because the first thing the word of God does to you is to transform the inner man, the soul of the man, and God doesn\u2019t depend on miracles to do it. So there is a lot of impact we make on people through fellowship.\n\nHow then do we distinguish between genuine miracles and fake ones, because most Nigerians are craving miracles now?\n\nThere are values associated with a genuine preacher, which should not be trifled with. When a preacher trifles with that, we suspect him. For instance, clarity of vision. Second is genuine attention to the word of God. The third is the character that word of God produces \u2014testimonies. There are things that, if you hear about men of God, you begin to wonder if they are genuine people. What you see is excessive materialism, the way prosperity is being flaunted as though it was the only criteria. The King died on the cross as a total sacrifice. So his name should not be traded with. The final criteria is association \u2014who is your father in the lord? At least, you should have someone to look onto, and then somebody you are encouraging.\n\nSo what do you have to say about a prophet like the celebrity prophet, Odumeje Indabosky?\n\nI don\u2019t know who Indabosky is. In the days of Acts of Apostles, there was a Bar Jesus. The Bible says he depended on sorcery to do wonders in the land of Samaria until Peter came. Still in the Acts of the Apostles, the Bible mentions another man who was using divination to get money for his master. There is a lot of magic going on. There are some men of God, if I say they are magical, you will be embarrassed. But, if you give them time \u2014because we are not judges \u2014 nature won\u2019t be patient.\n\nYou are 56 years now, have you changed your mind on getting married?\n\nThe oath of celibacy is for life. As long as I am on earth, it\u2019s just to give it totally to God. He made me that way. Handling temptations from females is not hard to handle if you make up your mind. I have created a structure that doesn\u2019t give room for temptation. My PA is a man. I don\u2019t travel to preach with a woman. A woman has not entered my apartment for about 5 years. I don\u2019t carry a woman in my car.\n\nWhy did you take the oath of celibacy?\n\nI didn\u2019t just take the oath. There are three categories of eunuchs: those made eunuchs by God; those who became eunuchs because of their contributions to the kingdom, and those who men made eunuchs to be used. I belong to the first category. I just discovered I was born that way for a purpose; for the work I came for. I am a preacher of a kind. And that particular oath of chastity shares a covenant with poverty. So, as long as I am not married, I won\u2019t have things. Even my Bible, books (both the ones I bought and the ones I wrote) all bear the name of the church, and not my personal name. This church premises is situated on 18 plots of land -\u2014that\u2019s about three hectares, from the gate to the sea. I bought it in the name of the church. It costs millions of naira. It doesn\u2019t bear my name as the owner because of that oath of poverty. So the oath is not just about chastity; it\u2019s also about poverty. So I don\u2019t believe in owning things. You don\u2019t preach prosperity to me. It\u2019s also a mystery. You know, I preach eternal life in the flesh. I don\u2019t fall sick. I don\u2019t go to the hospital. Meanwhile, I am out of sight of many, that is, I don\u2019t go to the supermarket. I don\u2019t visit people\u2019s houses on a regular basis. For instance, I haven\u2019t visited anybody\u2019s house for five years. People don\u2019t visit me at home except those I am living with. That\u2019s a restricted life.\n\nOne might say since you lead a life similar to a monk, you ought to be submitting yourself to daily strokes of the cane as monks of the old were used to. Are you not thinking in that direction?\n\n(laughs) Do I need to be flogged? I live a life of purpose, why should I be punished with strokes of the cane? (laughs). I don\u2019t need to be punished. The pain of the consecration is enough for me. The fire that sustains that oath is very hot, so there is no need for further pain.\n\nWere you ever in a relationship, or have you always been celibate? Do you have female friends?\n\nThere is an age of awareness. I passed through secondary school and university. And if you can see, people are praying in the hall. In the process, people come around; sometimes women cook food and give it to me, and I do pastoral work. But that relationship has its limits (laughs). As I told you, there are restrictions; no female church member visits me. I spent most of my time alone in my office. I only spend a little of my time at home daily.\n\nAre you a virgin?\n\nWhen you hear chastity, it\u2019s just that. The word \u201cchastity\u201d is deep. It\u2019s only those who are involved from God that know what\u2019s involved in it. The feelings of a eunuch can\u2019t be regular. If the emotions are regular, then you will have problems. That\u2019s the difference between a God made eunuch and a man made eunuch. If a man is meant to get married and he chose to be a eunuch, he may naturally have challenges in coping with it.\n\nThe oath is tied to why I came to this world. If I break it, I don\u2019t exist. The oath involves the altar here \u2014I don\u2019t bury people here. I mean, my church members don\u2019t die untimely deaths, because I have to pay that price to preserve the people and the church. It\u2019s not something I should not be hypocritical about. It\u2019s not whether people are watching me or not. God is watching me. So if I fail in my oath, the things attached to it will go. There are benefits that I enjoy because I live this way. There are certain angelic services I enjoy because of that life. I enjoy angelic massage, feeding and injection. If I need to be injected, when I lay down, they give it to me. If I am exhausted and I need to be ministered to, they will serve me. If I break the covenant, the benefits will fade. So I am better inside than outside. Some people wonder if I do it secretly, but I am not a hypocrite.\n\nHow then do you fight and conquer temptations? A handsome and successful man (of God) will have ladies drooling all over him. How do you cope?\n\nYou have asked me this before. There is a structure in place to checkmate that. For instance, I have never had a lady secretary or personal assistant. I don\u2019t travel with women. I don\u2019t live with women. Much of the work women would do for me is done by men. So the structure I have reduces the temptation. You know, there is power in contact. Apart from the structure on ground, I already have this nature in me. The eunuch\u2019s life is a spirit in a man; it\u2019s not a decision. That\u2019s why it works in consonance with poverty. I feel like helping pastors sometimes. They talk about prosperity, but they don\u2019t see the ability to see the negative side of accumulating wealth. Some of this wealth is not from genuine sources, but they don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why you see them falling sick. Sometimes when problems start coming to them, they can\u2019t trace the source because of avarice. They want to grab things.\n\nThat means you don\u2019t own mansions anywhere?\n\nIt\u2019s not possible. The oath is not unto man, so there is no need for hypocrisy. I have a camp that contains over a hundred rooms and halls. During camping, people use it. I am also developing this place in Ajah to house over a hundred rooms for the kingdom. That\u2019s the kind of thing I do. I build houses in a public place where people can use it. I have churches all over Nigeria and outside the country.\n\nDo you believe in other people getting married and do you conduct weddings in your church?\n\nWhy not? I have pastors all over the world. They are all married. I support them. There are some of them who wanted to remain single, but when I saw they were having pressures coping with it, I encouraged them to marry, but I haven\u2019t wedded anybody. Weddings take place in the church, however, but my regional coordinators and pastors handle them. If I like, I attend. If I don\u2019t like, I won\u2019t attend.\n\nMany men of God in this part of the world run their ministries with their wives, and some with their children. How do you run yours?\n\nThe pattern is there in the Bible. Peter wasn\u2019t Jesus\u2019 wife. Moses handed over to Joshua, and Elijah gave the mantle to Elisha. There is a structure that commands who is who in the ministry, that is, the organogram of this church has not brought any wife into it.\n\nHow do you counsel couples since you don\u2019t have a marriage experience?\n\n(laughs) You don\u2019t need to have a marriage experience to counsel. I have been a pastor for 28 years, so pastoring has given me that experience to handle such issues. I do counseling for couples, but that is not my major. You met me writing here.\n\nBy taking the oath of celibacy, are you not working against God\u2019s instruction that man should \u201cbe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it?\u201d\n\nIf you look at what you said, God wants partnership for man; it\u2019s not necessarily wife. I am not here alone. I am working with a team of people. What God wants is dominion. You are talking of a natural family; there is also a spiritual family. The dominion I want is the dominion of God\u2019s kingdom, so I already have a team of people who are helping in the dominion, like church members, leaders \u2014in this place, we have coordinators and different kinds of pastors all over the country and beyond. And then, the fruitfulness is the evangelism, soul winning and church planting, just like Jesus who did have a wife; just like Apostle Paul; just like Elijah accomplished so many things without a natural family.\n\nRecently, Edo State was in the news for trying to impose compulsory vaccination on the people, including churches and mosques, who have to show their vaccination certificates in order to enter the church. Even the state chapter of CAN was reported to have given tacit support before protests erupted against it\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s an embarrassment. CAN shouldn\u2019t support that. Except for organisations or a particular church where the head is being led that way. They should not force things that require choice. They should not force somebody to live or die. If somebody thinks vaccination will help him live and another says he doesn\u2019t need it, nobody should be forced. It\u2019s possible for the vaccine to have a negative influence on people who didn\u2019t really accept it, but it\u2019s a matter of choice. Nobody should impose compulsory vaccination on Nigerians. For instance, I won\u2019t vaccinate; I don\u2019t believe in it. I cannot vaccinate at this time in my life. Don\u2019t you know I am not married? It\u2019s not a normal life. I don\u2019t believe in death, for instance. I don\u2019t take drugs. I haven\u2019t taken drugs for ten years, and I won\u2019t anytime. Why should I vaccinate? Have you met me on the road before?\n\nSeven years ago, I was given an award in Ghana as The Best Inspirational Writer, but I didn\u2019t travel to receive it. Another group gave me an award in Cotonou, and I didn\u2019t go. They gave me another one in Togo, I didn\u2019t go. Some journalists asked me, \u201cShepherd, are you afraid of light?\u201d I asked them how, and they said, \u201cBecause they will capture you.\u201d I told them I would go with time\u201d (laughs).\n\nThe recent takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban has raised fears there might be a replica in Nigeria if care is not taken. Do Nigerian Christians have to worry?\n\nNo, those who are saying that are not right. Afghanistan is a different country from Nigeria from religious setting to geographical differences. Afghanistan is predominantly Islamic, while Nigeria is about 50-50. So how does an Hausa man, for instance, come to Enugu and say everybody should become a Muslim. That means nobody would be alive.\n\nBut Benue State governor, Samuel Orton, has continued to talk about a covert plan to islamise Nigeria\u2026\n\nIf it is true, it\u2019s not everything anybody attempts that works. I get embarrassed when people say there is an attempt to Islamise a country that is complicated. Do you know that I came from a village in Anambra where nobody knew anything about Islam? Even Anambra as a state doesn\u2019t understand Islam. I grew up not knowing anything about Islam. So how do you Islamise us?\n\nSo the fears are unfounded?\n\nYes. Even in the north itself, like Taraba, Plateau, Borno states, they have a big Christian population.\n\nSo what do you have to say about the Plateau killings where several states had to hurriedly evacuate their students, mainly Christians, from Jos? Is there any way out of the recurring killings?\n\nThe problem cannot be solved completely because of the mix-up. You just manage it. We need intelligent leaders. I lived in Jos more than 30 years ago as a student at UNIJOS. It has always been like this. Once in a while, things flare up. Jos is predominantly a Christian area. While it happens in Jos is because the Plateau man is also fierce; he is also fierce. His tolerance is low, too. So there are constant confrontations. When the Muslims come up with intimidation, they react, and they (Christians) are more in number.\n\nWhy do you think these problems persist?\n\nNigeria as a nation doesn\u2019t have sacrificial leaders who really love the country. That is why politics has its problems. People care more about what they get, and, when they care more about what they get, they turn their eyes against the evil in the land like the constant banditry and kidnapping. If our politicians are genuine, they will stop these things. We should also be courageous to say that some of these things are encouraged by our politicians. Some people who don\u2019t like Buhari steer up some of these things to make his government ungovernable, even among the governors. Look at what is happening in Zamfara and Katsina. The other day, roads were blocked and motorists were stopped from moving in Katsina. That is Buhari\u2019s home state, it\u2019s embarrassing. The politicians are the ones causing these problems. Sometimes you wonder if these things would end, because, if Buhari, as an ex soldier, can\u2019t handle it, it might be more difficult for somebody who doesn\u2019t come from a military background or an inexperienced person to solve. Buhari is an experienced person.\n\nWhile Buhari was encouraged to take over from Jonathan, we thought he could solve these problems. You can see that the north was more peaceful during Jonathan\u2019s time than now. The issue of banditry and kidnappings were not there then. It was only Boko Haram. Now, other things have joined. The Fulani herdsmen menace is spreading in the north. It wasn\u2019t like that before. Look at the NDA attack and kidnapping the other day in Kaduna.\n\nWhat about dividing the country as being canvassed by separatist groups?\n\nNot exactly. Nigeria\u2019s problems are not what one man can solve. What I think we should do is for the godfathers of Nigeria to prayerfully come together and look at what\u2019s possible, because Nigeria is good to be together, not carving out Oduduwa or Biafra republics. That Biafra is not genuine. The ulterior motive is excessive individualism, making gains from people. It\u2019s just like that in Yorubaland. What is necessary is restructuring, with more powers to the regions, so that people can control their areas. If Nigeria must continue to be together, I think it must be done. If Nigeria would be at peace, people should withdraw to themselves and encourage themselves and come with a voice to meet the centre. Buhari may not be able to do it, but the next president, somebody who loves Nigeria, should bring Nigeria to restructure.\n\nIn the meantime, Nigerians should have more tolerance for each other. When you ban open grazing, it\u2019s not good to tell our Fulani brothers to leave the states totally if arrangements haven\u2019t been made for them. If a state can provide land, why not? They are our brothers. Saying that Nigerians should not be in the midst of Nigerians is not right. It\u2019s not every Fulani man who is carrying an AK 47. Forty years ago, I grew up seeing Fulani nomads going about peacefully. So they should look at the problems and nip it in the bud. We shouldn\u2019t label every Igbo man an IPOB member. So we shouldn\u2019t look at every Fulani man as a killer. Nigerians should learn to tolerate one another. Nigerians should accept their destiny as Nigerians and find godly ways to solve them.\n\nNigeria is a country in prophecy. Despite the evil men, there are genuine men of God, Christians and Muslims, and their percentage is high. So we have hope. Nigeria is better as one. The problems won\u2019t end even if we divide.\n\nWhat\u2019s new?\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), rose from its 138th meeting on Friday, with a stern declaration that the door has been permanently shut against Bureau De Change operators (BDCs) and that no amount of pressure will make it rescind its decision.\n\nThe CBN Governor and MPC Chairman, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who made the declaration also vowed to take on Aboki FX for its alleged illicit activities in the Nigerian forex market.\n\nEmefiele also disclosed that the committee retained all policy parameters, leaving the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 11.5 per cent; asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; the CRR at 27.5 per cent; and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the MPC expressed concerns over the blooming insecurity in the country, calling for its arrest because it was capable of retarding the economic recovery momentum.\n\nOn forex, Emefiele said the CBN would continue to restrict the activities of illegal forex dealers, even as he advised forex seekers to explore the Investors and Export (I and E) window to ensure transparency and stability in the market.\n\nHe also advised banks to adhere strictly to CBN guidelines on forex sales.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will continue to sanitise the forex market and eliminate illegal dealers. Those who wish to procure Forex should go to the banks. If you have genuine businesses, the bank can expand the limit of $5,000. We can give that approval once we\u2019ve been informed.\n\n\u201cMy view is that the only exchange window is the I and E. We expect everyone to go there and you will be attended to. I do not hope to recognise any other rate in the market.\n\n\u201cNigeria remains the only Central Bank that dips its hands into its reserve and sell to BDCs in an attempt to stabilize forex market. It has stopped and stopped for good. US, UK etc do not do that.\n\n\u201cGo to your banks for everything from fees, medicals, etc. We can expand the limit. You want to sell dollars, go to your bank. Call any bank not selling to you, we will step in but with fake visas and travel tickets, they won\u2019t sell to you. If you cancel your ticket, you should send the forex back to the bank. If you don\u2019t, the banks will alert and pursue you and give your details to EFCC. They will pursue you and get the money back\u201d, Emefiele explained.\n\nOn its grouse with Aboki FX, the CBN Governor said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been investigating Aboki FX for two and half years. He lives in UK but has a Nigerian address. We have detected that he is an economic saboteur.\n\n\u201cOur preliminary investigations show a lot about him. Those who want to sabotage the country and sabotage the efforts of this administration will be dealt with.\n\n\u201cAboki FX was registered in the UK in 2015. He doesn\u2019t want to name those behind him. He has 25 accounts. Shows illicit activities\n\n\u201cHis website is used for manipulation by changing the rate over a given period. We will pursue and get them.\n\nMr. Oniwinde directly benefits from the rates he quotes. How does he get his data? How many BDC staff come to ask for daily rate? How many BDCs supply him information? In which country does an unlicensed operator determine rates? Why target Nigeria. It\u2019s pure economic sabotage and we will get them.\n\n\u201cCBN Act Section 2 states that only the CBN can determine rates. So, we will not allow this to continue. How does he collect his data? If he doesn\u2019t come out, we will go after him\u201d, Emefiele stated.\n\nThe CBN Governor added that the MPC wants further measures to be taken to drive down inflation while maintaining adequate surveillance on banks with compliance on loan disbursement without being exposed to unhealthy risks.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Umahi Challenges PDP Govs on Zoning of Presidency to the South",
          "text": "*Accuses them of dishonesty, says their body language shows party not interested in power shift\n\nBennett Oghifo\n\nGovernor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State yesterday mocked governors of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum who joined in adopting the resolution for power shift to the South, saying their body language shows the party won\u2019t zone the Presidency to the South.\n\nThe Southern governors, led by Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, had in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their meeting in Enugu State on Thursday insisted on power shift to the South.\n\nUmahi, who spoke on a television programme yesterday, alleged the PDP governors at the meeting in Enugu were being dishonest with their claim that they are keen about the 2023 presidency going to the South.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne or two governors that own PDP, their body language suggests that are against zoning and I can tell you from reliable source that they are thinking just for their own interest.\n\n\u201cThe truth remains that a number of us \u2013 the Southern Governors \u2013 that were in that meeting; that did say that Presidency must come to South, especially PDP, are not being honest. Let\u2019s see what they (PDP) come up with in their zoning in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of decisions taken at the Southern Governors\u2019 meeting that I know that together, there is sincerity of purpose in them. But when it comes to politics, I see the hand of Esau and the voice of Jacob.\u201d\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor warned that the alleged dishonesty of the PDP governors in the Forum might threaten the unity of the Southern governors.\n\nUmahi also opposed the resolution of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum supporting the collection of the Value Added Tax by states.\n\nHe knocked his colleagues on the platform for being \u201cselfish\u201d, adding that he won\u2019t pursue VAT collection or implement the decision of the Forum on the issue.\n\nUmahi said the resolution of the Forum on VAT did not reflect his stand.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Governor, who was represented at the Enugu Southern governors\u2019 meeting by his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, said: \u201cIn any gathering, the minority will have their say and the majority will have their way. For example, there was an issue that came up on VAT; I\u2019m not sure it is clear to some of our colleagues but it is very clear to me.\n\n\u201cWe (Ebonyi) took a stand as a state with our leaders on the issue of the VAT war that is ongoing and so my deputy carried it on to say that this is what my governor is saying and this is what the state is saying and he went ahead to explain with some other deputies that represented their governors.\n\n\u201cBut together, they were in the minority and it didn\u2019t stop the majority from coming up with their communiqu\u00e9. When it comes up to implementation and voicing out, I will continue to say \u2018this is where I stand\u2019, if it is a choice, I will choose what would benefit my state.\u201d\n\nUmahi continues: \u201cThere is no state in the country that is not enjoying the help of other states. When they (Southern governors) said this VAT collection is part of true restructuring, I said I never believe in total restructuring; I believe in administrative restructuring.\u201d\n\nUmahi said a number of states would collapse should VAT collection move from the federal to the sub-nationals.\n\nHe said it was not right that some states would \u201ceat and have so much surplus and then some other states don\u2019t have much to eat.\u201d\n\nUmahi said: \u201cWe have to be our brother\u2019s keeper; we have to see how we can grow the economies of the weakest states, otherwise, we will breed insecurity in those states. There is no way in a relationship that you will get 100 per cent of what you put in, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Ebonyi State would be viable for VAT collection, should the court rule that sub-nationals have the power to collect VAT within their domains, Umahi said: \u201cI have said that my state would not be viable and I will continue to say that more than 30 other states would not be viable; we should not break the states.\n\n\u201cWhatever thing we are doing, we have to think about the nation first. Let\u2019s tarry a while and see how we can pass this river and then we can come to the fact of who is right and who is wrong.\n\n\u201cTrue federalism is not done in a day. If we want to do a restructuring, we have to have a gradual process to do that.\u201d\n\nVAT is a consumption tax paid when goods are purchased and services are rendered. It is charged at a rate of 7.5 per cent.\n\nAlthough Rivers and Lagos states have started the process of collecting VAT within their territories, the Court of Appeal in a ruling on September 10 stopped the collection pending the determination of an appeal filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, which favoured collection of VAT by states.\n\nApart from Lagos and Rivers states, Ogun State has also started the process of passing a bill on VAT in its House of Assembly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Strike continues, insists NARD; to appeal ruling\n\nAlex Enumah and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nJustice Bashar Alkali of the National Industrial Court, Abuja Division, came down hard on striking doctors yesterday, ordering them to halt their seven weeks old industrial action and return to work immediately.\n\nThe doctors, under the platform of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), have been on strike since August 1, 2021, in protest against alleged poor condition of work and \u201csome unfair government policies.\u201d\n\nThey had vowed never to return to work until the federal government met their demands. Plea by President Muhammadu Buhari for them to return to work was also turned down.\n\nHowever, Justice Alkali, while ruling on an interlocutory injunction brought against the striking doctors by the federal government yesterday, held that their action, at this time of COVID-19 pandemic, was not in the interest of the country and Nigerians.\n\nHe accordingly ordered NARD to suspend its strike with immediate effect and that its members should resume at their duty post immediately.\n\nThe order is coming barely few days after the striking workers and the federal government appeared to have been working towards an amicable resolution of the issues surrounding the industrial action.\n\nAfter it failed to pacify the striking workers not to embark on the industrial action, the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Health had instituted a court action against NARD and in the process urged the court to compel the doctors to return to work pending the hearing and determination of the main suit.\n\nDelivering ruling in the interlocutory injunction last month, the court had restrained parties to cease hostilities pending the hearing of the federal government\u2019s suit against the doctors.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, lawyer to the federal government, Mr. Tochukwu Maduka, had informed the court that he had filed a case of contempt against NARD.\n\nHe said, \u201cDespite the order of this court that all hostilities be suspended, the defendants who render essential services have refused to call off the strike.\u201d\n\nResponding, lawyer to the striking doctors, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, had told the court that he has filed a further affidavit in support of notice for stay of execution.\n\nFalana further stated that he was challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter.\n\nHe, however, stated that parties should go back to the negotiation table, adding that it was in line with the order to suspend hostility.\n\n\u201cWe can resume today or even tomorrow if a decision is reached,\u201d he said then.\n\nWith this understanding, Justice Alkali consequently adjourned to yesterday for parties to report to the court whatever understanding or agreement reached towards resolution of the crisis.\n\nBut it appeared this was not the case yesterday, as Mr. Maduka urged the court for an order directing the defendant to suspend the strike pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\n\nThis request was however opposed by lawyer representing NARD, Mr. Robinson Ariyo, who claimed that granting such an order, would infringe upon the right to life of members of his client, especially under the conditions of the pandemic.\n\nAriyo further claimed that members of the NARD were persons entitled to emergency rights under the Corona Virus Disease COVID-19 Protection Regulations and other related best practices in connection with the mental and physical health of its members.\n\nBut in its ruling, the court agreed with the federal government that continuation of the strike would cost the country and accordingly ordered NARD to suspend the strike and call back its members to work.\n\nAccording to him, the applicants were \u201cable to show that unless this application is granted, so many Nigerians will lose their lives, most especially, as the country is experiencing an upsurge in this third wave of COVID-19 with increasing fatality arising from the absence of the defendants from hospitals.\u201d\n\nThe judge further expressed strong belief that \u201cIf the court does not intervene at this stage, there is no amount of money that can compensate the lives of Nigerians who would lose their lives if the members of the defendants continue with their strike.\u201d\n\nWhile he observed that parties ought to have suspended all hostilities since the matter was brought to court, he said he found merit in the application of the federal government and accordingly resolved the lone issue for determination in its favour.\n\n\u201cI grant all the prayers as contained in the face of the motion paper and in effect, I hereby grant an order of interlocutory injunction that members of the defendant/respondent in all the states of the federation are hereby restrained from continuing with the industrial action embarked on since on the second day of August 2021 pending the determination of the substantive suit.\n\n\u201cAlso, I hereby order all members of the defendants/respondents in all the states of the federation to suspend the said industrial action commenced on the second day of August 2021 with immediate effect and to resume work immediately pending the determination of the substantive suit,\u201d Justice Alkali held.\n\nDoctors Appeal Ruling\n\nThe leadership of NARD yesterday said it had asked their lawyers to appeal the ruling of the Industrial Court ordering them back to work, and to also file application for stay of execution.\n\nIn a statement signed by its President, Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, NARD said they were not satisfied with the ruling of the industrial court.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, especially those that were present in court today, the NIC has given a ruling on the application for interlocutory injunction filed by the federal government. We are not satisfied with the ruling.\n\n\u201cAfter consultations with our lawyers, we have instructed them to appeal the ruling and file application for stay of execution,\u201d NARD said.\n\nIt said its lawyers had argued at the last hearing that the court ought to hear and determine its notice of preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the court before taking the application for interlocutory injunction or any other application.\n\n\u201cToday, (Friday), the court ruled that it would take government\u2019s Application for interlocutory injunction first and our Notice of Preliminary Objection would be taken and determined along with the substantive suit.\n\n\u201cAlso, our lawyers drew the attention of the court to our application for stay of execution of the exparte order and that the court should take that application first. The court insisted that the government application would be taken first.\n\n\u201cBy the refusal of the court to hear and determine our Notice of Preliminary Objection before taking government\u2019s application for interlocutory injunction, we believe we have been denied fair hearing, which is a fundamental right. In the circumstances, we have instructed our lawyers to file necessary processes.\n\n\u201cWe urge all members to remain calm and resolute. Everything depends on our firm resolve. We are committed to protecting your rights within the confines of the law. We believe Justice shall be ours ultimately,\u201d NARD said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Promises to deal with illegal forex trader, retains MPR at 11.5%\n\nJames Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday vowed to send the Economic and Finance Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other security agencies after Nigerians fraudulently acquiring foreign exchange in the form of Personal Travel Allowance (PTA)/Business Travel Allowance (BTA) from banks.\n\nThe CBN, in a recent circular, said defaulters of its forex policy were customers that obtain PTA/BTA from banks, using fake visas, and others who cancel their flights and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed.\n\nThe CBN governor, while answering questions from journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in Abuja said there were evidences that people had deceitfully bought forex from banks using fake visas, and under the pretext of traveling, only to cancel their tickets afterwards.\n\nHe said a particular study had shown that one of the banks sold forex to 52 people who said they wanted to travel.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cAfter two weeks, they went to check, and 40 out of the 52 had canceled their tickets. How could you have a situation where about 70 per cent or 80 per cent of people who went to a bank to buy BTA on the excuse that they wanted to travel cancel the trip?\n\n\u201cBank sold to them but they turned back and then went and sold it to black market because they wanted to enjoy the arbitrage.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said such fraudulent means of acquiring foreign exchange would no longer go unpunished, adding that the CBN was committed to meeting all legitimate Fx demands in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, if you go to a bank with fake ticket, fake visa, fake passport, we have told them not to sell to you. If they sell to you mistakenly because you hoodwinked them to sell to you and after two weeks, they checked and found that you canceled your ticket or your visa is fake, they will call you because you are their customer; they have your BVN, they have your number \u2013 they will call you to return the dollars.\n\n\u201cIf you do not return it, they will place your name on their website, your BVN on their website and we will pick those details and we will send them to EFCC and other crime agencies and they will pursue you, you must return the dollars because you cannot acquire it illegally. That is our position.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor also announced that the bank would track down and bring the founder of AbokiFx, Mr. Oniwinde Adedotun to book for alleged speculative activities on the foreign exchange \u201cwhich amounted to economic sabotage.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said Adedotun had been conducting nefarious and criminal activity on the Nigerian economy by indulging in forex speculation in contravention of the CBN Act which vested the apex bank with the sole responsibility for determining the rate of the Naira.\n\nThe CBN governor said: \u201cWe found him as a Nigerian who lives in England, and conducts this nefarious and criminal activity on our economy. It is an economic sabotage and we will pursue him wherever he is. We will report him to international security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy.\u201d\n\nHe described Oniwinde as an illegal Fx dealer who started the AbokiFx operation in 2015, adding that he had since milked the economy by taking position and manipulating the exchange rate to the detriment of the economy.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN had investigated the activities of AbokiFx for the last two and a half years, adding that since inception of business in 2015, the company had continued to file the same account balance sheet of \u00a31,000 to the UK Government for four consecutive years.\n\nHe alleged that in Nigeria, the company had over 25 bank accounts with about eight banks in both naira and dollar with significant turnover which indicated that he had been milking the system through speculative information activities on the Naira and collecting his proceeds in cash through a particular ATM in London.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the CBN governor said the bank would continue to do its job of safeguarding the financial system for the betterment of everyone.\n\n\u201cA few questions: Has Nigerians ever asked how exactly AbokiFx collects his data that he publishes on his website? How many BDCs can claim that they have either seen a staff of AbokiFx coming to ask for daily rates or how many BDCs send daily returns on exchange rate to AbokiFx. How then do they determine what the rate is and they post them illegally on their website.\n\n\u201cIn which other country will unlicensed single person be the one that sets exchange rate in that country? How come he sets exchange rate of our own country, and why is he not setting exchange rate of the Pound and Dollar or Pound and South African Rands? Why target Nigeria, and yet you are a Nigerian?\n\n\u201cYou chose to live in London, enjoy all the spoils in London at the expense of the blood of Nigerians. You will pay for it.\n\n\u201cThe CBN Act Section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the Naira, and yet a single unscrupulous individual who lives in London continues to manipulate the exchange for Nigerians, continues to make huge profits, continues to collect these profits in cash ATMs in London while ordinary Nigerians suffer the consequences of these actions. We will not allow this to continue again.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank also yesterday resolved to retain Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as interest rate, at 11.5 per cent and the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nIt retained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nAboki FX Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, Online foreign exchange update platform, Aboki FX, responded to allegations against it last night, saying it would no longer provide daily updates on foreign exchange rates following complaints by the CBN that it is responsible for the current crisis in the Forex market which has brought the naira to its knees.\n\nAboki FX said in a statement that it would no longer publish exchange rates for now and hoped that the naira would stabilise.\n\n\u201cAboki FX is fully functional but we will not be publishing any form of rates on our platform for now. We sincerely hope this suspension will lead to the naira appreciation from next week. With our decision to temporarily suspend online rate publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many,\u201d it said.\n\nThe platform denied manipulating the market, adding that there was no way it could have such power.\n\nIt further stated that it usually gets its information from bureau de change operators in Lagos.\n\n\u201cNone of our data source providers know who we are or what their rates are being used for. This is to avoid any manipulation of rates. Our staff have a daily routine of going to the market to gather rates as all the BDCs in the country have their rates clearly displayed on their rates board and parallel market dealers give the information away freely. All we do is collate all that information and display it on all our platforms daily,\u201d the firm said.\n\nAs regards allegations of fraud levelled against its founder, Olusegun Oniwinde, by the CBN governor, the company said such allegations were not proven.\n\nThe firm said it doesn\u2019t trade forex and it had always stated this on social media.\n\n\u201cAboki FX purely provides benchmark parallel rate information which helps guide our users in almost 200 countries across the world. Aboki FX does not trade FX which we have always maintained in our emails and social media platforms,\u201d it said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe National Judicial Council (NJC) has constituted a Special Investigation Committee to handle the issue of three judges of courts of coordinate jurisdiction over their granting of exparte orders, resulting into conflicting orders of courts.\n\nConsequently, the affected judges have been directed by the NJC to appear before the panel and show cause why disciplinary actions should not be taking against them.\n\nA statement by the Director of Information, NJC, Mr. Soji Oye, announcing the Special Investigation, after NJC\u2019s 95th meeting in Abuja, did not reveal the names of the three judges that would appear before the panel.\n\nOye said besides those referred to the special panel, the NJC also looked into and took decisions on issues regarding some other judges.\n\n\u201cThe National Judicial Council under the Chairmanship of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice I. T. Muhammad, at its 95th Meeting held on September 15 and 16, 2021, in line with the principles of fair hearing, has directed the three Judges of coordinate jurisdiction who granted Exparte Orders over the case with the same subject matter to appear before a special Investigation Committee constituted by the Council in order to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for such act,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the Council resolved to set up a Medical Board in order to ascertain the health status of Justice Amina Yaroson of Kaduna State Customary Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cCouncil also considered the Reports of its Investigation Committee and decided to issue a warning letter to Hon. Justice Sobere Biambo of High Court of Rivers State for descending into the Arena of conflict in a matrimonial Suit No: OHC/IMC/2018.\n\n\u201cCouncil at its Plenary considered the Reports of the two Preliminary Complaints Assessment Committees (PCAC) on the petitions written against 18 Judicial Officers and on the recommendation of the Committee, issued a letter of advice to Hon,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nIt noted that Justice Elias O. Abua of Cross River State High Court was warned to be wary of granting an Order staying the execution of judgement which appeared executory in nature as the one he granted in Suit No. HC/MSC/67/2019.\n\nMr. Oye said that the NJC, however, dismissed the petitions written against Justices I. E. Ekwu and Ayo-Emmanuel of the Federal High Court; Justices O. O. Ogunjobi, S. B. A. Candide-Johnson and S. A. Onigbanjo of High Court of Lagos State; Justices Chiwendu Nwogu, S. C. Amadi and A. U. Kingsley Chuku, amongst others for either lacking in merit, subjudice or statute barred.\n\nThe statement also said that the NJC considered the Report of the Interview Committee and agreed to recommend 12 candidates as Heads of Court, 18 candidates as High Court Judges, six candidates as Kadis of Sharia Courts of Appeal and one candidate as Customary Court of Appeal Judge.\n\n\u201cThe Notifications of retirement of 22 Judges of the Federal and State High Courts and Notifications of death of three Judges of States were also considered by the NJC Plenary,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe issue of conflicting court orders between July and August as it pertains to the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship Election and the leadership crisis in the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) got to a worrisome and embarrassing height that the CJN had to summon six Heads of Courts to explain the rationale behind the development.\n\nAfter his meeting with the six Heads of Courts, the CJN hinted of setting up a committee to investigate the issue.\n\nJust few days back, an Upper Area Court judge was referred to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Judicial Service Committee for probe for summoning former Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Chukwuma Soludo over alleged infractions of Code of Conduct for public officers, an issue said to be outside his jurisdiction.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Gloria Okorie: Civil Society, RULAAC Calls For Urgent Audit Of Police Detention Cells In Imo",
          "text": "A civil society organisation, the Rule of Law And Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), has called on the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to embark on an independent audit of detention cells in all police formations in Imo State, particularly, the cells of Tiger Base of the Inspector-General of Police's Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\n\nAccording to Okechukwu Nwanguma, Executive Director of RULAAC, several persons in the state have been missing and their whereabouts unknown to their relatives.\n\n\n\nThe NHRC was established by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) ACT, 1995 as amended to deal with all matters relating to promotion, protection and enforcement of human rights in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt has become imperative that the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), in keeping with its mandate and powers under the amended NHRC Act 2010, undertakes or is mandated by the President to undertake immediate visit to police cells in Imo State, particularly, the cells of Tiger Base of the Inspector-General of Police's Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\n\n\u201cSection 6(1d) of the amended NHRC Act states that the Commission shall have powers to (d) visit persons, Police cells and other places of detention in order to ascertain the condition thereof and make recommendations to the appropriate authorities.\n\n\u201cSeveral people, especially young people in imo State have been missing and their whereabouts unknown to their relatives. Some have either been executed and their dead bodies deposited in mortuaries or are secretly detained and tortured at the IRT Tiger Base office, Owerri, Imo State and possibly at other locations.\n\n\u201cRecall that the commercial motorcyclist who revealed Gloria Okorie's detention at the IRT Tiger Base office in Owerri Imo State after he was himself released from the same facility after two weeks in detention was quoted as saying that many others were similarly being detained at the base and their relatives do not know their whereabouts.\n\n\u201cRecent unconfirmed information making the rounds has it that one Anyanwu Amarachi Amos has been detained at the same 'State CID OWERRI (TIGER ZONE)' for the past two months and has been severely tortured. The message was said to have been passed through one of the recently released inmates at the IRT Tiger Base, Owerri. The messenger further revealed that Amarachi's people are not aware of his whereabouts 'and he has been totured to the extent that he cannot stand and walk on his feet. Please lets save our innocent brother'.\u201d\n\nRULAAC added that the case of the secret detention of \u201cGloria Okorie, the 21-year-old student from Imo State who was arrested along with the commercial motorcyclist conveying her and secretly detained at the Tiger Base office of the IRT in Owerri and her subsequent transfer to the Abuja headquarters of the IRT\u201d remained unresolved as the police continued to disobey te court orders.\n\nRULAAC said, \u201cGloria, a student, had just written the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Examination (JAMB) before her arrest. IRT suddenly labelled her a spy girl for IPOB following public outcry over her continued incommunicado detention and calls for her release or arraignment in court.\n\n\u201cAn Abuja High Court had ordered the police to arraign her in court or release her on conditional bail within a specified period which has long elapsed.\n\n\u201cAttempt by the IRT to get the court to vacate its order on them to release Gloria was turned down and the court reiterated its orders which the police are yet to comply with till date.\n\n\u201cThe silence by the Inspector General of Police, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the President over this travesty and blatant disrespect to Court orders defines the rule of law profile of the Buhari regime. The activities of the IRT in Imo State have become a serious cause for concern. Hundreds of youths have been reportedly killed, disappeared or held in secret, incommunicado detention by IRT.\n\n\u201cWhile some of the 'lucky' ones are extorted of huge sums of money before they are released, many others are held without their families knowing their whereabouts. In cases where their families find out and come for their release, they are denied access. Even lawyers are not allowed to see their clients. Many of the detainees are tortured and held in conditions that amount to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment.\n\n\u201cWe wonder why the IRT has continued to maintain a base in Imo State after the IGP in July 2020, ordered the disbandment of the satellite bases of the IRT and other tactical units of the NPF in response to popular outrage over their atrocities.\u201d",

          "text": "China\u2019s leading ride-hailing company, Didi will be launching in Nigeria soon.\n\nFounded in 2012, Didi is China\u2019s dominant ride-hailing service, with 550 million annual active users globally. It operates in 17 countries, recently launching in South Africa, Ecuador, and Kazakhstan.\n\nA job listing on Linkedin suggests that the company, which launched in South Africa in March, is looking to recruit a Driver Center Manager in Lagos, Nigeria. The first of many steps it\u2019s taking as it prepares to expand to the Nigerian market.\n\nOutside of this opening, Didi is currently recruiting for a number of positions around the world, with the only other African job openings being in South Africa.\n\nPer NYT, on average, 156 million people a month used Didi in China in the first quarter of 2021, compared with 98 million for Uber worldwide. Didi handled 25 million rides a day in China during that period while Uber globally did 16 million. Note that those numbers do not include Didi\u2019s services in Latin America, Japan, Russia, and beyond.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDespite Didi\u2019s growing dominance in the ride-hailing scene, there are questions around whether it can continue its global expansion as it feels the ripple effects of increased regulatory pressure at home.\n\nIn July, Didi\u2019s much anticipated US IPO was blundered after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced that it was investigating Didi\u2019s handling of customer data and ordered the removal of the app from mobile app stores in China. Since then, the ride-hailing company\u2019s shares have fallen more than 50% below its IPO price.\n\nLast month, Didi also delayed plans to expand to Britain and Europe, partly due to political and regulatory challenges.\n\nCompeting in Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing landscape\n\nDidi expands by employing a race to the bottom approach that requires tons of capital.\n\nCompetition among rideshare apps is already fierce in Nigeria.\n\nRide-hailing companies Bolt and Uber, which arrived in Nigeria in 2014 and 2016 respectively occupy an increasingly important role in the transportation system in many Nigerian states. In terms of operations, these two companies have taken a different approach as Uber operates only in major commercial cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt while Bolt operates in more cities including smaller ones like Abia, Ebonyi, and Enugu.\n\nThese two ride-hailing companies have faced a few hurdles in Nigeria, notably unfavorable regulatory policies and protests from drivers.\n\nEarlier in the year, under the umbrella of the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Partners Association (PEDPA), Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on strike protesting the unrealistic fare prices and the high commission rates. In response to this strike, the two companies Uber increased their prices.\n\nJust like its South African market, Didi might want to introduce different classes of services to suit different customers based on their needs and financial capacity.\n\nThe ride-hailing startup firm is already out pricing and out advertising its competitors in South Africa through partnerships with local radio station 947 and Didi ride voucher giveaways.\n\nIt offers three services: DiDi Go which is the low-cost option for customers with low financial capacity; DiDi Express which is the standard service for those seeking to balance price and comfort; DiDi XL which is for people who need more space, with a capacity of up to seven seats.\n\nUsing the hashtag #YourNewRideHasArrived Twitter user Reabetswe recalled her first ride with Didi writing:\n\n\u201cAs a young woman and a student in South Africa, @didi_south is an affordable ride\u2026my ride was the safe ride I have experienced in my life\u201d.\n\nShe followed her tweet with screenshots of receipts from her $1.03, 3.9-kilometer journey, a ride that would have cost $2.57 without discounts.\n\nIn Nigeria, a race to the bottom approach appears to be Didi\u2019s best option in the midst of already fierce competition.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Africell exits Ugandan telecom market due to fierce competition",
          "text": "On September 7, Africell announced its decision to leave Uganda after operating in the East African country for seven years. The decision saw the U.S-owned company become the latest network operator to throw in the towel and exit a market dominated by two pan-African telecom behemoths.\n\nA statement issued by Africell blames tough competition from the local units of MTN and Bharti Airtel, both of which account for more than 90% of the market share. The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Existing investors like Adjuvant Capital, KdT Ventures, Plexo Capital, Endeavor Capital, and Ingressive Capital participated in the round.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Dr Abasi Ene-Obong (CEO), 54gene is a healthtech company centred around unlocking scientific discoveries and enhancing diagnosis and treatment outcomes across Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand its genomes and molecular diagnostics department across Africa, guaranteeing that African patients have access to reliable diagnostics and enabling the adoption of precision medicine in clinical settings throughout the continent.\n\nAccording to Dr Ene-Obong, the company plans to expand its contribution to global drug discovery by investing in the development of life science skills on the continent, something which this fund will facilitate.\n\nFor context on what 54gene does and why you should care, you should revisit this story as told by the startup\u2019s COO, Delali Attipoe.\n\nBuilding a hardware startup through resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObialunanma Nnaobi and Obasegun Ayodele.

Although Ayodele was introduced to the hardware space when he was in secondary school at LAUTECH International College in Ogbomosho, Nigeria, he failed at the four different startups he founded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut rather than throw in the towel, he learnt from his failures and moved on, knowledge in hand.

However, the vast majority do not have any legislation in place.\n\nAccording to Privacy International, a UK-based registered charity that defends and promotes the right to privacy worldwide, although the number is slowly rising, only 24 African countries have adopted laws and regulations to protect personal data.\n\nBecause this is a problem in Africa, Techpoint Africa has launched the Privacy Roundtable, a monthly series focusing on privacy issues and happenings in Africa, with input from experts and non-experts.\n\nOgheneruemu gave us a sneak peek of what we can expect from this series.\n\nCurious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOurPass, a digital commerce solution headquartered in Nigeria has announced its launch over a virtual event.\n\nRevealing the motivation for building the startup, Samuel Eze, co-founder and CEO disclosed that the idea for OurPass came from watching his mother struggle to make purchases online.\n\nAll too often, she had to switch between various eCommerce sites and frequently ended up not buying anything.\n\nFurther research showed that she was not the only one who had such challenges. With this evidence, he set out to solve the problem with OurPass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOurPass is a mobile app that enables consumers to shop in one click thereby reducing abandoned carts and increasing sales for merchants. All you have to do is to sign up on OurPass once and you\u2019ll never have to do that again.\u201d\n\nAs mobile and internet penetration has grown in Africa, more people are comfortable with the idea of shopping online. The growth of fintech startups especially in the payments space has also facilitated the growth and acceptance of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nHowever, despite this progress, like most parts of the world, issues with checkout and needing to visit multiple eCommerce stores to make a purchase remains a challenge.\n\nAccording to Shopify, 24% of people abandoned their shopping cart because the site required them to create an account while 18% of people abandoned their cart because of a long and complicated checkout process.\n\nIt is this problem that OurPass is determined to solve. With its mobile application, users only input their details once and subsequently, are able to make purchases on the platform.\n\nTo do this, the startup has curated a few merchants on the platform and recently acquired Storemia, an online storefront provider.\n\nThe startup offers users three major offerings: a 0.8% transaction fee capped at \u20a61,000 for merchants, five percent commission, and free deliveries. Customers can also purchase airtime and pay bills on the platform. Buyers enjoy free delivery, fast, easy and safe checkout across all websites that have OurPass integrated, and can track all their orders and transactions.\n\n\u201cThe coming together of Storemia and OurPass is one of the revolutionary mergers in the Nigerian tech space because both products are very complementary. Storemia in itself is the easiest and fastest way to create eCommerce stores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOurPass is the fastest checkout tool for eCommerce stores so when you bring the power of Storemia and the power of OurPass together, then you have a super product,\u201d Bolu Oluwagbesan, founder of Storemia said.\n\nThe startup has raised a pre-seed round of $1 million led by Tekedia Capital and angel investors from Fortune 500 companies.\n\nProfessor Ndubuisi Ekekwe, founder of Tekedia Capital, expressed delight to be investing in the startup. \u201cI remember the first time the OurPass team pitched their idea to me. I immediately knew that it was a great product because if we can reduce the friction customers have when they want to pay for something, everyone will be very happy.\u201d\n\nBarbara Salami, one of the angel investors said, \u201cThe platform resonates with me because it truly opens up access to commerce where customers beyond having the opportunity to securely and conveniently place orders could potentially place and receive orders from anywhere in Africa.\u201d\n\nTo sign up as a merchant or buyer, head over to the website or download the OurPass app from the Google Play Store.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo days ago, I received a call from my best friend. She had recently been sent a message by a loan company informing her that someone had taken out a loan and defaulted. She was listed as a guarantor and was to ensure that this person paid back the money, or she would be in trouble.\n\nShe was reasonably panicked. She contemplated what would happen to her since the loan company claimed to have her bank account details. She wondered if they could really do anything to her.\n\nIn the Nigerian context, this is a familiar story. In August 2021, Nigerian loan company, Sokoloan was fined \u20a610 million by the National Information Technology and Development Agency (NITDA) for invasion of privacy.\n\nNITDA said the company had been illegally accessing users\u2019 contacts, defaming customers, and had malicious malware from third parties tracking customers without their consent on its app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few years ago, we concluded that Nigerians care less about data protection. Hasty? Maybe not.\n\nIn January 2021, we conducted a Twitter Poll on people\u2019s thoughts about WhatsApp\u2019s intended privacy policy update. Of the 210 respondents, 56.2% did not care about the policy update.\n\nThe update meant that WhatsApp would be able to share information with other Facebook companies.\n\nHowever, data protection and privacy remain important subjects. From a PoS transaction to entering information on a health app, data is exchanged and needs to be protected.\n\nThe Privacy Roundtable is a monthly series focused on privacy issues and happenings in Africa with input from experts and non-experts.\n\nWe will discuss privacy issues peculiar to the African landscape and speak to data protection and cybersecurity experts, tech enthusiasts, and even tech indifferent people.\n\nBefore we dive in, here\u2019s an explanation of frequently used and sometimes confusing concepts.\n\nWhat is data privacy, and how is it different from data protection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nWhile both terms are often used interchangeably, they mean different things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData privacy or information privacy refers to an individual\u2019s right to authorise access to their data. This also applies to organisations.\n\nData protection is the process of safeguarding information from corruption, compromise, or loss.\n\nSo while data privacy focuses on who has access to your data and the right to safeguard it, data protection is based on data availability and management.\n\nBy law, data protection is the responsibility of the organisation receiving such data.\n\nAlthough data privacy can exist without data protection, there would be no need to safeguard data if there is no right to do so.\n\nAt the heart of both terms is data processing.\n\nData processing refers to any operation or set of operations performed on personal data. This could include collecting, recording, organising, structuring, storing, disclosing, and erasing.\n\nWho are the persons involved?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several entities involved in data processing.\n\nData subject\n\nA data subject refers to any living individual whose personal data is processed by an organisation. For example, Bongo wants to get a loan, so he opens an account with a loan company. In this case, Bongo is the data subject.\n\nData controller\n\nThis refers to any person, organisation, or body that receives and controls an individual\u2019s data. The data controller determines the purpose and means of data processing. Using Bongo\u2019s case, the loan company is the data controller.\n\nData processor\n\nA data processor refers to a person, company, or body that processes data on behalf of the data controller. This could be an employee of the controller or an external body or person. So in this instance, Bongo\u2019s loan company could decide to have an employee handle the role. They could also choose to hire an external expert or company.\n\nWhy is data privacy and protection important?\n\nMost people believe that data privacy is for people who have something to hide. However, this is not true.\n\nData privacy deals with personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, date of birth, addresses, passwords, and ATM card pins. If this information gets into the wrong hands, a lot of damage could be done. And data protection is trying to stop this from happening by safeguarding vital information.\n\nIf PIIs are not adequately protected, one could be the victim of identity theft, suffer the loss of important data, or have their money stolen.\n\nThe importance of this grows as the amount of data received increases. This is why corporations like Facebook and Google are expected to pull out all the stops to protect users\u2019 data. However, this also applies to smaller companies.\n\nThese rights also apply in cases of cross-border data transfer.\n\nWhat rights do you have?\n\nApart from the right to decide who gets access to your data, by law, individuals have the right to request that their data be deleted.\n\nThere is also the right to access your personal information without any cost to you, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to get more information on further processing.\n\nThis is why laws mandate data controllers to have privacy policies.\n\nThese rights apply to online and offline data.\n\nWhat is a privacy policy?\n\nA privacy policy is a statement or legal document that discloses the ways a data controller collects, discloses, and manages personal data it has received.\n\nFlowing from this, Bongo\u2019s loan company must have a privacy policy describing how his PIIs are collected or if they are collected at all, whether third parties have access to his data, contact details of the company\u2019s data processor, and how long his data is being kept, among other things.\n\nIt should explicitly describe whether information is kept confidential and be as straightforward and explanatory as possible, devoid of too much legal jargon.\n\nA privacy policy is important to both the data subject and the data controller.\n\nFor you, it gives some insight into how your data is being processed.\n\nIt also ensures that data controllers, like Bongo\u2019s loan company, comply with regulations and gives them an edge over competitors when they are as transparent as possible.\n\nWhich laws apply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Africa, only eight countries have either a data protection act, a regulation, or a semblance of both.\n\nEthiopia, Tanzania, Nigeria, and Namibia do not have comprehensive data protection laws. However, a draft data protection law is expected to be presented to the Namibian Parliament in 2021. On the other hand, Nigeria published a draft data protection bill in August 2020, but it has yet to be presented.\n\nThese countries have either issued a proclamation or regulation, or are in discussions to do so.\n\nCurrently, only Kenya, South Africa, Togo, and Uganda have comprehensive data protection laws. However, these laws have only been developed but haven\u2019t been implemented. All four countries do not have an established regulatory authority overseeing the laws.\n\nHowever, the laws and regulations prescribe penalties for breach, what should be contained in privacy policies, data processor or controller requirements, among others.\n\nA placeholder\n\nWhile these explainers are not exhaustive, they give a general idea of what you should expect from the series.\n\nHowever, this explainer would be updated regularly to cover previously unexplained concepts.",

Despite the significant contribution of SMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges persist that hinder the growth and development of the sector. We are back with Small Business Saturday, a monthly column that highlights 5 African small businesses a month.\n\nSmart Money Africa producers of The Smart Money Woman on Netflix\n\n\n\nArese Ugwu\u2019s bestseller The Smart Money Woman hit the Netflix screens as a series on September 16th. The premise of the book follows 5 friends, reminiscent of African sex in the city but the African version and with a focus on personal finance. What makes this more fascinating, is that the premise of the book and series is to teach African women about personal finance and financial literacy. I read the book in 2017 and could not put it down. It was a practical and entertaining read filled with financial knowledge and worded in a way every young woman can understand. The series has the same effect as I watched all episodes in two nights. Five glamorous millennials strive for success as they juggle careers, finances, love, and friendships. Arese Ugwu has broken down very important financial advice compellingly and entertainingly. The series stars Osas Ighodaro, Ini Dima-Okojie, Kemi Lala Akindoju. This series is a great way to be entertained and learn financial gems. A must-watch. The production is by Smart Money Africa.\n\nRead also: Winning the Market Through Branding and Direct Response Marketing\n\nR&R Luxury\n\n\n\nOn a recent trip to Ghana, I discovered R&R Luxury, and it has become one of my favorite natural and organic body care brands out of the continent. It\u2019s a Ghanaian natural plant-based skincare brand founded by Valerie Oba. They are conveniently located at the airport in Accra and are also available online and in Lagos. I got the baobab oil which smells amazing as well as the liquid black soap, the body butter balm which is a roll-on moisturizer, and the lop butter. I love their products and I find the packaging to be luxe while the products are fairly priced. They are committed to ethical sourcing, nature preservation, and job creation across their value chain.

          "text": "As Nigeria\u2019s naira continues its freefall against the dollar, resulting in increased erosion of most investment assets including pension funds, Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) are looking to dollarised investment windows to hedge against the devaluation of assets.\n\nThey are therefore engaging the industry regulator, the National Pension Commission (PenCom), to come up with a workable model that will enable PFAs to invest in dollar-denominated assets outside Nigeria, as provided in the pension law. This is so that in the medium to long term, contributors and retirees could have bolster to accommodate increasing devaluations of the local currency.\n\nNigeria\u2019s naira last Thursday fell to an all-time low of N552 per dollar at the unofficial market as demand pressure persists, according to data from abokifx.com, which many investors regard as the clearest mirror of the free market rates.\n\nThe local currency fell sharply to N525 (from N504) to the dollar on July 28 after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced that it would discontinue the sale of dollars to the Bureau De Change (BDC) operators due to foreign exchange infractions.\n\nThis fall no doubt has continued to erode the value of contributors and retirees funds, creating increasing concern for managers of the fund.\n\nAt the end of July 2021, pension assets under management stood at N12.78 trillion, with 9.45 million contributors registered under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS).\n\nJide Allo, head, Investment Management at Stanbic IBTC Pension Managers Limited, speaking on the future of pension funds amid increasing devaluation of the naira, says, \u201cDevaluation of the naira is indeed a concern for pension administrators\u201d.\n\nAllo says the PFAs are working together with PenCom to develop a framework that will enable pension funds to be invested in dollar-denominated assets within and outside Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Allo, this will help sustain the value of the pension assets and for the benefit of the contributors.\n\nHe says another \u2018big\u2019 in the industry expected within the short to medium term is when contributors can be able to use part of their pension assets as equity contribution for a mortgage.\n\nRead also: Stanbic IBTC Pensions seeks fitness, healthy retirement for clients\n\n\u201cAll of these are expected to enhance pension assets value for our contributors,\u201d he states.\n\nPenCom in a statement on erosion of pension assets over depreciation of the naira notes that it is the duty of the PFAs to administer the contributions and invest in such a way that will ensure safe and reasonable returns on investment.\n\nAccording to the commission, the reserved fund created by the PFAs under the Act would compensate for any erosion of the value of the contributions.\n\nOguche Aguda, CEO of Pension Fund Operators Association of Nigeria (PenOp), says the PFAs have continued to explore innovative ways towards unlocking sustainable investment of the pension assets by accelerating domestic credit to the private sector for infrastructure development and deepening the domestic debt capital markets.\n\nSpeaking on their strategic partnership with InfraCredit, he states that as the largest source of long-term investment capital, institutional investors like Pension Funds have an especially important role to play as an effective investment tool to deliver the three pillars of the #SDGs: economic, environmental and social sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the success of this collaboration will advance economic development, sustainability, job creation, and higher living standards in Nigeria,\u201d he says.\n\nThe objectives of the CPS is to ensure that every person who worked in either the Public Service of the Federation, Federal Capital Territory, States and Local government or the Private Sector receives his retirement benefits as and when due; and to assist improvident individuals by ensuring that they save in order to cater for their livelihood at old age.\n\nThe provisions of this Act shall apply to any employment in the public service of the Federation, the public service of the Federal Capital Territory, the Public Service of the state, the public service of the local governments and the private sector.\n\nIn the case of the Private Sector, the Scheme shall apply to employees who are in the employment of an organization in which there are three or more employees.\n\nNotwithstanding the provision of subsection (2) of this section, employees of organizations with less than three employees as well as self-employed persons shall be entitled to participate under the micro pension scheme in accordance with guidelines issued by the commission.",

          "text": "As port concession period reaches its 15th year, terminal operators that entered 15 years contract agreement with the Federal Government are now worried as to whether the government would renew their operating licence or takeover their terminals.\n\nSome of these terminals whose operating licences are already due for renewal include ENL Consortium in Apapa Port, Tin-Can Island Container Port (TICT), Josephdam Port Services Limited, Five Star Logistics Limited and Port and Cargo Handling Services Limited in Tin-Can Island Port.\n\nMost of these terminal operators, who started with 10-year contract period on Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis, had their licences extended in 2016 for another five years each after reaching the first 10 years of handling cargo in the ports, and the five-year extension is expected to expire this year.\n\nMohammed Bello-Koko, acting managing director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), said in Lagos recently that the NPA\u2019s management had constituted a committee to review the terminal lease agreements in line with operational realities.\n\n\u201cNPA has secured approval for the renewal of expiring leases for five terminal operators and the process has commenced. We have constituted a committee to review the lease agreements in order to achieve the objectives of the port reforms,\u201d Bello-Koko said.\n\nHe listed the terminals to include Ports & Cargo Terminal Limited, ENL Consortium Terminal C and D, Josephdam Terminal, and AMS Terminal in Delta Port.\n\n\u201cWe understands that Rotimi Amaechi, the minister of transport, has given an approval to the NPA to renew the licence of most of these terminals that their agreements will expire this year,\u201d says a source close to one of the terminals, who does not want his name in print.\n\nAccording to the source, though the approval has not come but it is on good authority that it is presently being processed by the NPA.\n\nRead also: Multiple Customs checks, agencies\u2019 interference stifle businesses at ports\n\nGiving insight into the agreement, the source however discloses that there is a clause in the concession agreement that states that government must give three years eviction notice to any terminal it wants to terminate its contract.\n\nThe source further adds that none of the terminals in question is given such eviction notice, which automatically means that the Federal Government must retain or extend their licences.\n\nOn his part, Adewale Adeyanju, president, Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), calls on the Federal Government to retain existing terminal operators at the ports due to the significant impact they have made over the past 15 years.\n\nHe says terminal operators have improved service delivery at the ports and enhanced the welfare of port workers, especially dockworkers.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that the government should not review the operations of terminal operators but we are saying that they should allow peace to reign in the industry. From 2006 till date, there is an element of improvement in terminal operations,\u201d he explains.\n\nEmma Nwabunwanne, a Lagos-based importer, says there is a need for the Federal Government to review the activities of terminal operators in line with plans of the immediate past management of the NPA to ensure strict sanction of non-performing operators.\n\nHe notes that some of these operators have invested in the acquisition of cargo handling equipment and have ensured seamless cargo clearing in their terminals while some have failed to make a serious impact in developing their terminals as required.\n\nRecall that the Federal Government in 2006 entered into a concession agreement with private sector players to take over cargo handling operations in the nation\u2019s seaports on a build, operate and transfer basis.\n\nThe aim, according to the government, is to improve service efficiency and reduce the cost of doing business through serious investment in cargo handling equipment and the development of terminal yards for stacking of imports.\n\nIn addition, the Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) says private sector fiscal contribution to the ports and Federal Government increased to over N538 billion within 11 years of port concession from 2006 to 2017.\n\nThese were monies collected from commencement fees, lease fees, throughput fees and tax payments by the concessionaires as well as revenue put into infrastructure development, and investment in equipment.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin \u2013 The University of Benin (UNIBEN) said the growing worrisome trend of students\u2019 late registration was reason for introduction of the N20,000 late registration fee.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Lilian Salami, made the assertion at a news conference on Friday in Benin.\n\nSalami explained that the behaviour amongst students had continued to have negative down-stream impact on the institution\u2019s operations, and ability to deliver the quality of education and students\u2019 support she promised and committed to, as vice-chancellor.\n\nBeyond this, she said, research further showed that there was a direct correlation between late registration and poor student academic performance.\n\n\u201cThe sad fact is that less than 25 per cent of our students register on time yearly, no functional or high performing education institution can thrive with such lackluster statistics,\u201d she said, adding that early registration remains critical for effective operations of the university.\n\nAccording to her, timely registration provides insight into the students\u2019 volume/demand and allows for smarter planning to ensure that there are enough staff, courses and funding to support the students accordingly.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that in the past, other non-financial interventions in attempts to urge early registration have failed.\n\n\u201cIt was based on the bad practice that the university Senate on Aug. 2, agreed to increase the existing payment of late fee from N10,000 to N20,000 on all students, as another attempt to further encourage early registration.\n\n\u201cThe announcement saw significant growth in early registrations from 2020 rate of 35 per cent to 93 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this rate of early registration in decades. It is a UNIBEN record without question, and Kudos to those students who chose to make their education a priority,\u201d the vice-chancellor said.\n\nShe noted, however, that the senate reversed the decision due to the outcry from students, in spite of the violent engagement of some students.\n\nSalami noted, notwithstanding, that the reversal of the position would not break the institution.\n\n\u201cI fundamentally believe that there are very few decisions that are irreversible and this is definitely not one of them. At this time, the N20,000 late fee is reversed and it is a closed case.\n\n\u201cUniben is resilient and we will continue to move forward with a strong conviction to ensure that the university reaches its full potential as a premier academic institution.\u201d\n\nThe vice-chancellor said she was proud of the progress the institution had made over the last 20 months under her watch.\n\nShe expressed satisfaction over the continued improvement in students\u2019 experiences in power supply, water supply, renovated and livable hostel spaces, clean and beautiful environment, improved teaching and learning conditions/materials, improved students\u2019 work study programme and academic excellence among others.\n\nShe pledged that her administrative team would reflect on the lessons learnt from the last few days in shaping future policies and back-end processes.\n\n\u201cHow we gather the voice of the students and how we leverage technology to address these kinds of issues in the future.\n\n\u201cThe goal remains \u2018to ensure that our great institution continues to strive and create an environment where all can succeed\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the imposition of the N20,000 late payment fee on students, on Tuesday, led to a two-day mass protest in the institution, forcing the management to reverse the decision.\n\n...",

          "text": "The most important determinant of the value of the Naira is whether or not the Nigerian economy is productive and competitive in international trade. That is to say, whether it has a diversified base of complex, value added products it exports and earns forex from those exports. I am not talking about diversification to cashew nuts and yam tubers. No. Those are primary commodities, not complex, value added ones that are the product of serious engineering and innovation.\n\nSince we obviously don\u2019t have such an economy, our main FX earner is crude oil, which gives us 90% of our FX. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t control the price of crude. Its pricing is volatile and unstable as a result of various international political and economic factors. This means that because we are essentially a one-product country, a one-trick pony, we are exposed to instability in our main income source. When the price of oil drops, and as the world innovates toward alternative energy sources, the amount of external reserves we have to back up the international value of our legal tender (our reserves) frequently comes under pressure. It\u2019s those reserves, our main defense in a soccer analogy, that determines the value of the Naira.\n\nThis is why, among the five main objectives of the Central Bank of Nigeria we have : \u201cissue the legal tender currency in Nigeria\u201d, and \u201cmaintain external reserves to safeguard the international value of the legal tender currency\u201d. So if we don\u2019t diversify but continue to rely on crude oil as a mono -product economy, the Naira crisis will get worse, not better.\n\nUnfortunately, achieving a diversified, complex economy, especially in a resource dependent economy, is not easy. It requires a a high level of knowledge, political will and consistency in economic policy and takes decades to achieve. This was the subject of my lecture a few months ago to the 2021 Annual Conference of the Nigerian Economics Students Association (NESA) held at the University of Port Harcourt, and will feature in my forthcoming book in 2022, The Pundit\u2019s Mind.\n\nThere are other facts as well that affect the value of the Naira. These include the basic factor of supply and demand (if too much Naira is chasing scarce dollars, the dollar gets stronger relative to the Naira, and vice versa). Others are inflation (a high inflation economy such as Nigeria\u2019s weakens the value of the legal tender), high government indebtedness ( again, our case especially relative to our revenues and ability to pay which will be stretched the more we borrow on poor revenues, and 90 kobo out of every N1 goes to debt servicing).\n\nSpeculation also affects the naira value, as there are currency traders around the world for whom the weakness of a currency is their very good fortune. Such traders \u201cattack\u201d such currencies for profit, especially where the currency is using a fixed, official exchange rate determined by the central bank instead of the market. As the Naira is effectively measured against a \u201creserve\u201d currency (dollars, euros, pound sterling), speculators can attack such a currency for profit if the country (Nigeria in this case) is perceived to have insufficient foreign reserves to meet demand.\n\nBecause our inflation rates at 17% are way higher than those \u201creserve-currency\u201d countries, again we are exposed to possible currency attacks. If reserves are weak, and demand for dollars massively outstrips supply, currency devaluation is inevitable, and currency traders who mount speculative attacks profit from this devaluation. Such traders will borrow the Naira from Nigerian banks, convert it to, say, dollars, then buy short-interest paying Nigerian bonds. If, as the speculators anticipate, the central bank devalues the naira, the traders sell the bonds in the foreign currency, convert them into naira, and repay the original Naira loan. The steeper the devaluation the higher the speculator\u2019s profit.\n\nWhat should we do about all of this? As I have said before, and say again, we have two options. One is to let the Naira find its level in the market. In order, words, the CBN should stop subsidizing the currency. While there will likely be an immediate spike in the price of the dollar, this move will have two advantages. The first is that, because Nigeria has a big, profitable economy and market, dollars will likely swamp the market seeking profits for investors.\n\nWhen this happens, the laws of demand and supply will work in favor of the Naira. Alongside this, maintaining different exchange rates for different kinds of transactions must end. This is called rate convergence.\n\nThe second, and more important benefit is that, since the current practice of the CBN pumping dollars in the FX market (from the reserves, which also depleted them) is essentially a subsidy for imports, which has made Nigeria more and more import dependent, letting go of the subsidy on the Naira will refocus the economy towards exports.\n\nThis will create an incentive for complex production of a quality that can be competitive in the international market. Accompanying this must be the right trade policies to support and create such incentives for massive exports of finished, value added goods from Nigeria.\n\nIf we don\u2019t want to go this way, perhaps because of the political risk of an immediate further drop in the Naira value (which will recover in the medium to longer term if the right policies are pursued), we can consider dollarization of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHere the dollar officially becomes a legal tender in Nigeria, either replacing the Naira or alongside it. Countries such as Panama, Liberia, Ecuador, Zimbabwe have done this.This\u2019ll lower interest rates and help deepen the financial sector because we are a high inflation country.\n\nBut this carries serious consequences too. Nigeria will lose monetary autonomy (our central bank will no longer be able to take independent decisions on interest rates for example). The CBN will lose seigniorage, the revenues it earns from issuing currency from the difference between the face value of the Naira and its production cost. And of course, this will involve a loss of national prestige and independence. You could argue, of course, that what value is your prestige when your national economy is in tatters? So, there we are, the simplified A-Z of our FX crisis. Either way, tough decisions have to be made. Politics is easy. Real leadership is not.\n\nKingsley Moghalu OON\n\nIfekaego Nnewi",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has said it will appeal the judgment of an Oyo State High Court that awarded N20bn in damages against the Department of State Services in favour of Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo, alias Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja on Friday.\n\nHe said efforts were already being made to commence the process of appealing the judgment.\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of the Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan had on Friday ordered the Federal Government to pay Igboho N20bn as damages for the invasion of his residence in Ibadan and destruction of his property.\n\nThe judge, while delivering judgment in the fundamental human rights enforcement suit, ruled that the DSS should not harass or arrest Igboho or invade his residence. The court held that Igboho has the right to his free movement as contained in Section 35.1 (a)(b) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe judge also restrained the respondents, AGF and DSS, their agents, privies or associates in other security forces or anybody acting on their behalf or instructions from blocking the accounts of the Igboho in any bank or placing no debit thereon. He therefore directed them to lift the embargo where they had done so.\n\nOperatives of the DSS had on July 1 raided the Soka residence of Igboho and killed two persons during the invasion. The secret police also arrested 12 persons in the house but Igboho escaped. He was later arrested in Benin Republic.\n\nIgboho\u2019s counsel, Chief Yomi Aliyu (SAN), told the court that his client\u2019s house, vehicles and other valuables were destroyed during the invasion. He asked for damages of N500bn and an order restraining the DSS and the AGF from arresting him or freezing his accounts.\n\nBut Counsel for the AGF, Mr Abdullah Abubakar, argued that there was no evidence before the court that the blood seen in the video clip tendered by Aliyu was that of a human being.\n\nAbubakar also said there was nothing in the video clip that showed the house invaded belonged to Igboho or linked the AGF to the invasion. He had urged the court to disregard the exhibits and dismiss the entire suit.\n\nThe Counsel for the DSS, Mr T. A. Nurudeen, aligned with the submission made by the AGF\u2019s counsel as he insisted that there must be a proof from a hematologist to show that the blood seen in the video was that of a human being.\n\nNurudeen also tendered a video clip which was admitted by the court, where Igboho allegedly threatened to create an Oduduwa Republic, while urging the Yoruba to protect themselves with charms and guns.\n\nIn his ruling on Friday, the judge ordered the Federal Government to pay Igboho N20bn as damages. He noted that despite being a state high court, it had the jurisdiction to hear the suit because the invasion of the applicant\u2019s house happened within the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n\u201cThe reckless and indiscriminate shooting by the second and third respondents and their agents, which resulted in the death of two persons, was in itself a threat to the life of the applicant. Nobody shoots guns in order to entertain the people. Such conduct has a serious potential of killing the victim, and at best, constitutes a serious threat to the life of the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to believe that the cache of arms and ammunition allegedly recovered from the residence of the applicant really came from there.\u201d\n\nHe said further that in the absence of any evidence that Nigeria was in a state of war, the style and procedure adopted by the second and third respondents and their agents was \u201chighly condemnable, reprehensible, crude and most unprofessional.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that with the arms allegedly recovered from Ighoho\u2019s house compared to damages done, the deaths and the trauma inflicted on the applicant, his guests and neighbourhood, it remained doubtful if the exercise was worth it.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe style adopted by the second and third respondents in the case should be condemned in strongest possible terms, especially given the fact that they are maintained by Nigerian taxpayers. Yet, they did not hesitate to unleash such mayhem on a Nigerian citizen, who has not been pronounced guilty of any crime by any court in the land.\u201d\n\nThe judge said it would have been desirable if the identity of the agents who carried out the invasion so they could be liable for their infraction.\n\nThe court held that Igboho and his group have a right to self-determination and are free to hold their rallies as long as it is peaceful. Justice Akintola ruled that self-determination was one of the fundamental human rights of the citizens and it cannot be subjugated.\n\nThe judge also awarded N2m cost in favour of the applicant.",

          "title": "VAT war fueled by retrogressive politics \u2013 PGF DG -NigPilot",
          "text": "Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, an umbrella body for governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Dr. Salihu Moh\u2019 Lukman, has described as retrogressive politics the clamour by some State governors to control collection of Value Added Tax, VAT, in Nigeria.\n\nLukman stated that if the reason behind the clamor for decentralized control of VAT collection is based on divisive, ethnocentric injustice, then it is retrogressive politics which is a complete departure from the progressive politics which the APC stands for.\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike had sued and secured court judgment against the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, over the right of the State to control the collection of VAT.\n\nWike lamented injustice and inequitable distribution of resources generated from VAT, arguing that \u2018Rivers State generated about N15 billion as VAT in June 2021 but received only N4.7 billion, Lagos State generated over N46 billion as VAT in June, but got just over N9 billion, whereas Kano State generated N2.8 billion and also got N2.8 billion as allocation.\u2019\n\nIn his statement titled, \u2018Retrogressive Politics of Value Added Tax in Nigeria\u2019, issued Friday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, the APC chieftain wondered if State collection of VAT was going to prioritise the development of the nation\u2019s productive capacity or rather simply be about consuming the resources that are currently available, stressing that access may not necessarily translate into commitment to utilise the resources in ways that strengthened commitment of political leaders to invest in the development of Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nHe emphasized that if the priority is about consuming currently available resources, commitment of political leaders to mobilise investment to develop the nation\u2019s productive sectors will be weak, hence it is important to ensure that access to resources also come with increased commitment by political leaders towards developing Nigeria\u2019s productive sector.\n\nThe PGF DG maintained that the reason Nigerians are debating whether it is states or federal government that should collect VAT is as a result of significant increase in what is being generated from VAT, thereby making it an attractive variable in the struggle for resource control by State governments.\n\nLukman boasted that the APC government led by president Muhammadu has tremendously increased VAT from N759.43 billion in 2015 to N1.531 trillion in 2020, an increase of more than hundred percent.\n\nHe berated the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for generating very low income from VAT on account of both combination of weak institutional capacity and corruption in the public sector during its 16 years reign in power.\n\n\u201cNo matter what anyone want to say, the reality is that the significant increase in VAT in the country between 2015 and 2020 confirmed improved efficiency and reduced corruption in the process of collection and management of Nigeria\u2019s public finances.\n\n\u201cThe reality however is that credit must go to the APC led federal government of President Buhari. Whether it would have been possible if PDP is still in control of the federal government can only be wishful thoughts. If that were to be the case, why wasn\u2019t it the case at any point between 1999 and 2015?,\u201d he asked.\n\nLukman added that, \u201cGovernor Wike can audaciously and shamelessly talk about VAT today because, its value has significantly increased which made it attractive for a rich State like Rivers to be interested in controlling it. If Governor Wike has any morality, he should look back and acknowledge how small Rivers must have received as its VAT share before 2015. Being a leading member of PDP, what was responsible for the low VAT records in the country between 1999 and 2015?\n\n\u201cAs members of APC, it is important that Governor Wike is reminded that the current increased record of VAT collection in the country is made possible only because the PDP is no longer in power. If PDP were to be in power the fact of inefficiency and corruption in the process of collection and management of VAT would have continued and the amount collected would have remained relatively low. It is not by accident that VAT collection in the country significantly increased under APC led federal government. This is because one of the specific commitment of APC since 2015 as outlined in the section of the party\u2019s manifesto Funding a New Nigeria was that \u2018APC government will set about the urgent task of getting Nigeria\u2019s public finances in order, by tackling the massive waste, duplication and corruption in the system, diversifying the economy and expanding our tax base to increase non-oil revenues, and reprioritising public spending away from bureaucracy towards investment in infrastructure and improved frontline services.\u2019\u201d",

In the video and live broadcast programme, some of the ex-soldiers, most of whom were dismissed from Service for various acts of indiscipline and misdemeanours, made efforts to rationalize or give excuses for the various infractions that led to their exit from service using most uncouth language.\n\n\u201cWhile the military respects everyone\u2019s right to free expression and justice, it is important to know that the military profession has its peculiarity that borders on discipline, truth and respect. It also have a standard and effective procedure of seeking redress by any aggrieved personnel, even if dismissed. Notably, there exist the Harmonized Terms and Condition of Service (HTACOS) Soldiers/Ratings/Airmen (Revised) 2017 which was reviewed and signed into law on 26 January 2018 to harmonize the management of the 3 Services. Similarly, the Armed Forces Act Cap A20 the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 has relevant Section dealing with Discipline and Administration of Justice. Section 147 \u2013 202 of the Armed Forces Act which expressly deals with Post Trial Procedures as well as Appeals from Court Martial. What constitute status bar to appeals of cases are also well encapsulated in the Armed Forces Act. The extant laws are therefore available for persons appearing as Counsels to affected Service personnel to avail themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is important to understand that, Nigeria operates a voluntary military service. Therefore, it is expected that whoever decides to serve in the noble profession would abide by its ethics and code of conduct. If any of its personnel thus run foul of the law, there are procedures of ensuring the administration of military justice and discipline. Therefore, seeing dismissed military personnel disparaging the establishment by raising issues of perceived injustice years after their cases must have been disposed leaves much to be desired\u201d.\n\nThe statement concluded that, \u201cIt is advisable that whenever issues of Service discipline arises the media should give the respective Services benefit of doubt to address the issues raised rather than jump into conclusion of injustice and grant them airtime to reel out falsehood to justify their dismissal from Service\u201d.",

          "text": "Some Northern groups under the auspices of Northern Advocacy Groups , Thursday, threw weight behind the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria CBN, Godwin Emefiele, following calls for his resignation by a group in the north.\n\nIn a statement signed by, Alhaji Mohamed Bashir-Ali- Northern Professional Forum; Hajia Fatima-Abubakar- Arewa Business Women League; Mallam Sadiq Ibrahim- Arewa Frontier; and Comrade Yusuf Yahaya-Arewa Patriotic and Anti-Corruption Network , at a press briefing in Abuja.\n\nGroup said \u201cToday after an appraisal of the uncharitable utterances made by a supposedly Youth Assembly from the north, we came to a conclusion that it is imperative to address most of the issues wrongfully and mischievously presented.\n\n\u201cOur position is unanimous and we are all in support of Mr. Godwin Emefiele and his management team in CBN and all their effort to stabilize the Naira and grow our foreign reserve for the nation. This holistic resolve brought us together under the aegis of Northern Advocacy Group NAG.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate to observe that the misrepresentation and falsehoods emanated from some legislators who believe that pulling Emefiele down will culminate into their political God Father having access to Nigerian\u2019s money for his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that these persons feel that it is wisdom to tarnish and bring to ridicule, the outstanding effort of CBN just to gain the support of the President and seize power.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on those who find it profitable to peddle wrong information to stop. This act is unpopular, uncharitable and should not be associated with Northern interest.\n\n\u201cWe hereby state emphatically that any act designed to frustrate efforts of Mr. Godwin Emefiele to restore the economy from its downward slope orchestrated by fall and unstable price of crude oil and the advent of Covid-19 pandemic will be opposed.\n\nMeanwhile, the group unequivocally stated that, \u201cLet it been known that we are not part of any Northern organization trying to bring disrepute to the Government. We consider it wrong to call for the resignation of the CBN Governor by the Arewa Youth Assembly over an unproven claim that the policies of the CBN have leaped the county into poverty.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that any call for resignation of Emefiele will erode the achievements recorded by President Buhari in his effort to revamp the economy.\n\n\u201cThe economy was already in shambles and it got worsened by low prices of crude at the international market, empty treasury, corruption, dilapidated infrastructure and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the CBN Governor and his effort in expanding foreign exchange earning opportunities so as to increase our foreign reserve and raise the value of the Naira. It is our belief that this effort will improve the economy.\n\n\u201cThe politicians should please allow the Government to work; we are convinced that President Mohammadu Buhari will deliver at the end.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that some persons will make themselves available to unsettle the Government. No reasonable person will embark on such venture, because it is unpatriotic.\n\nThe group also warned that, \u201cWe should not be seen creating crisis for a Government that we all made effort to install. This is the time to support the Government for a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we request that everybody support this Government, there is no doubt that the Governor of CBN and his team will deliver.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria: CBN Promises to Deal with Illegal Forex Traders, AbokiFX Suspends Forex Updates",
          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Friday vowed to send the Economic and Finance Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other security agencies after Nigerians fraudulently acquiring foreign exchange in the form of Personal Travel Allowance (PTA)/Business Travel Allowance (BTA) from banks.\n\nThe CBN, in a recent circular, said defaulters of its forex policy were customers that obtain PTA/BTA from banks, using fake visas, and others who cancel their flights and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed.\n\nThe CBN governor, while answering questions from journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), in Abuja said there were evidences that people had deceitfully bought forex from banks using fake visas, and under the pretext of traveling, only to cancel their tickets afterwards.\n\nHe said a particular study had shown that one of the banks sold forex to 52 people who said they wanted to travel.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cAfter two weeks, they went to check, and 40 out of the 52 had canceled their tickets. How could you have a situation where about 70 per cent or 80 per cent of people who went to a bank to buy BTA on the excuse that they wanted to travel cancel the trip?\n\n\u201cBank sold to them but they turned back and then went and sold it to black market because they wanted to enjoy the arbitrage.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said such fraudulent means of acquiring foreign exchange would no longer go unpunished, adding that the CBN was committed to meeting all legitimate Fx demands in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cHowever, if you go to a bank with fake ticket, fake visa, fake passport, we have told them not to sell to you. If they sell to you mistakenly because you hoodwinked them to sell to you and after two weeks, they checked and found that you canceled your ticket or your visa is fake, they will call you because you are their customer; they have your BVN, they have your number \u2013 they will call you to return the dollars.\n\n\u201cIf you do not return it, they will place your name on their website, your BVN on their website and we will pick those details and we will send them to EFCC and other crime agencies and they will pursue you, you must return the dollars because you cannot acquire it illegally. That is our position.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor also announced that the bank would track down and bring the founder of AbokiFx, Mr. Oniwinde Adedotun to book for alleged speculative activities on the foreign exchange \u201cwhich amounted to economic sabotage.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said Adedotun had been conducting nefarious and criminal activity on the Nigerian economy by indulging in forex speculation in contravention of the CBN Act which vested the apex bank with the sole responsibility for determining the rate of the Naira.\n\nThe CBN governor said: \u201cWe found him as a Nigerian who lives in England, and conducts this nefarious and criminal activity on our economy. It is an economic sabotage and we will pursue him wherever he is. We will report him to international security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy.\u201d\n\nHe described Oniwinde as an illegal Fx dealer who started the AbokiFx operation in 2015, adding that he had since milked the economy by taking position and manipulating the exchange rate to the detriment of the economy.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN had investigated the activities of AbokiFx for the last two and a half years, adding that since inception of business in 2015, the company had continued to file the same account balance sheet of \u00a31,000 to the UK Government for four consecutive years.\n\nHe alleged that in Nigeria, the company had over 25 bank accounts with about eight banks in both naira and dollar with significant turnover which indicated that he had been milking the system through speculative information activities on the Naira and collecting his proceeds in cash through a particular ATM in London.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the CBN governor said the bank would continue to do its job of safeguarding the financial system for the betterment of everyone.\n\n\u201cA few questions: Has Nigerians ever asked how exactly AbokiFx collects his data that he publishes on his website? How many BDCs can claim that they have either seen a staff of AbokiFx coming to ask for daily rates or how many BDCs send daily returns on exchange rate to AbokiFx. How then do they determine what the rate is and they post them illegally on their website?\n\n\u201cIn which other country will unlicensed single person be the one that sets exchange rate in that country? How come he sets exchange rate of our own country, and why is he not setting exchange rate of the Pound and Dollar or Pound and South African Rands? Why target Nigeria, and yet you are a Nigerian?\n\n\u201cYou chose to live in London, enjoy all the spoils in London at the expense of the blood of Nigerians. You will pay for it.\n\n\u201cThe CBN Act Section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the Naira, and yet a single unscrupulous individual who lives in London continues to manipulate the exchange for Nigerians, continues to make huge profits, continues to collect these profits in cash ATMs in London while ordinary Nigerians suffer the consequences of these actions. We will not allow this to continue again.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank also resolved to retain Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as interest rate, at 11.5 per cent and the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nIt retained the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nAboki FX Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, Online foreign exchange update platform, Aboki FX, responded to allegations against it on Friday night, saying it would no longer provide daily updates on foreign exchange rates following complaints by the CBN that it is responsible for the current crisis in the Forex market which has brought the naira to its knees.\n\nAboki FX said in a statement that it would no longer publish exchange rates for now and hoped that the naira would stabilise.\n\n\u201cAboki FX is fully functional but we will not be publishing any form of rates on our platform for now. We sincerely hope this suspension will lead to the naira appreciation from next week. With our decision to temporarily suspend online rate publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many,\u201d it said.\n\nThe platform denied manipulating the market, adding that there was no way it could have such power.\n\nIt further stated that it usually gets its information from bureau de change operators in Lagos.\n\n\u201cNone of our data source providers know who we are or what their rates are being used for. This is to avoid any manipulation of rates. Our staff have a daily routine of going to the market to gather rates as all the BDCs in the country have their rates clearly displayed on their rates board and parallel market dealers give the information away freely. All we do is collate all that information and display it on all our platforms daily,\u201d the firm said.\n\nAs regards allegations of fraud levelled against its founder, Olusegun Oniwinde, by the CBN governor, the company said such allegations were not proven.\n\nThe firm said it doesn\u2019t trade forex and it had always stated this on social media.\n\n\u201cAboki FX purely provides benchmark parallel rate information which helps guide our users in almost 200 countries across the world. Aboki FX does not trade FX which we have always maintained in our emails and social media platforms,\u201d it said.\n\nJames Emejo and Sonia Mayomi in Abuja",

Thomas Manger told reporters on Friday \u201cthere have been some threats of violence\u201d linked to the event, where police would work to avoid clashes between Trump supporters and opponents.\n\nMore than 600 people have been charged with taking part in the Jan. 6 violence, which followed a speech by Trump reiterating his false claims that his election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud. Those claims have been rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of Trump\u2019s own administration.\n\nRioters that day battled police, beating them with sticks and metal barricades, smashed their way through windows into the Capitol building and ran through the halls, sending lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence running for safety.\n\nFour people died that day, one fatally shot by police and three from medical emergencies. A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by protesters died the day after and four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later committed suicide.\n\nAlmost 50 people have so far pleaded guilty to charges related to the violence, nine admitting to committing felonies. The vast majority of defendants have been released awaiting trial but about 75 are still in custody, according to court documents.\n\nMembers of the right-wing groups the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters are among those charged with storming the building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the rallying cries justice for January 6th. I think justice for January 6th would have been the impeachment and removal of Donald Trump,\u201d said Representative Adman Kinzinger, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 violence, in an interview with MSNBC.\n\nTrump was ultimately acquitted by the then-Republican-controlled Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we stop as a party or leaders accepting somehow these ideas of Oath Keepers, which is basically a militia that wants to overthrow the government, that that\u2019s okay,\u201d Kinzinger said.\n\nMatt Braynard, a supporter of Trump\u2019s false claims that his defeat was the result of widespread fraud who is organizing the rally, said he hoped it would lead to the release of people charged with taking part in the events of Jan. 6.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want to do is put a spotlight on the mistreatment of these individuals and encourage federal legislators to demand the Department of Justice deliver real justice to these people. And that means, in many cases, dropping charges,\u201d Braynard said in an interview on C-SPAN.\n\nWhile hundreds have been arrested for taking part in the riot \u2014 some of whom posted images online of their activities on Jan. 6 \u2014 questions remain unanswered. No suspects have yet been identified in the investigation into who planted pipe bombs at the Democratic and Republican parties\u2019 national headquarters near the Capitol on Jan. 5.\n\nA California man was arrested early this week after he was found near the Capitol with multiple large knives that are banned in the District of Columbia. His truck was decorated with white supremacist symbols and he made racist comments when approached by police, according to court documents.\n\nUnlike on Jan. 6, when Congress was in session to formally certify Biden\u2019s election, the Capitol will be largely empty on Saturday, with most members out of town.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin has put 100 National Guard troops on standby to help police protect the Capitol if needed. The National Guard troops, who will be unarmed except for batons, would be used after local, state and federal law enforcement capabilities had been tapped, the spokesman said.\n\nNational Guard troops were stationed in and around the Capitol from early January through late May, with as many as 5,200 troops in place at the mission\u2019s peak.",

          "text": "Australia\u2019s police arrested 235 people in Melbourne and 32 in Sydney on Saturday at unsanctioned anti-lockdown rallies and several police officers were injured in clashes with protesters.\n\nVictoria police said six officers required hospitalisation. Several officers were knocked to the ground and trampled, the police said and television footage showed.\n\nAbout 700 people managed to gather in parts of Melbourne, as 2,000 officers made the city centre virtually a no-go zone, setting up checkpoints and barricades. Public transport and ride shares into the city were suspended.\n\nIn Sydney, riot squad officers, highway patrol, detectives and general duties police were also deployed to the streets, preventing large gatherings.\n\nAustralia has been grappling with an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus since mid-June, with both Sydney and Melbourne, and the capital Canberra, in strict lockdowns for weeks now. On Saturday, there were 1,882 new coronavirus cases reported, most of them in Sydney.\n\nMost of the restrictions in Victoria, New South Wales and Canberra are to remain until at least 70% of those 16 and older are fully vaccinated, which based on the current pace of inoculations could be in late October or early November.\n\nA high rate of compliance with public health orders has helped Australia keep the number of infections relatively low, with just under 85,000 total cases and 1,145 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nThe vast majority of Australians support vaccinations and the public health measures, but there have been sporadic and sometimes violent protests against the management of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely disappointing to see another example of a small minority of the community showing a complete disregard for the health and safety of not only police, but each and every other Victorian,\u201d Victoria Police said in a statement.\n\nReporting by Lidia Kelly; Editing",

          "title": "US Admits Kabul Drone Strike Killed Civilians",
          "text": "The Pentagon has retreated from its defense of a drone strike that killed multiple civilians in Afghanistan last month, announcing that a review revealed that only civilians were killed in the attack, not an Islamic State extremist as first believed.\n\n\u201cThe strike was a tragic mistake,\u201d Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, told a Pentagon news conference Friday.\n\nMcKenzie apologized for the error and said the United States is considering making reparation payments to the family of the victims. He said the decision to strike a white Toyota Corolla sedan, after having tracked it for about eight hours, was made in an \u201cearnest belief\u201d \u2014 based on a standard of \u201creasonable certainty\u201d \u2014 that it posed an imminent threat to American forces at Kabul airport. The car was believed to have been carrying explosives in its trunk, he said.\n\nFor days after the Aug. 29 strike, Pentagon officials asserted that it had been conducted correctly, despite 10 civilians being killed, including seven children. News organizations later raised doubts about that version of events, reporting that the driver of the targeted vehicle was a longtime employee at an American humanitarian organization and citing an absence of evidence to support the Pentagon\u2019s assertion that the vehicle contained explosives.\n\nThe airstrike was the last of a U.S. war that ended as it had begun in 2001 \u2014 with the Taliban in power in Kabul. The speed with which the Taliban overran the country took the U.S. government by surprise and forced it to send several thousand troops to the Kabul airport for a hurried evacuation of Americans, Afghans and others. The evacuation, which began Aug. 14, unfolded under a near-constant threat of attack by the Islamic State group\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate.\n\nMcKenzie, who oversaw U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, including a final evacuation of U.S. forces and more than 120,000 civilians from Kabul airport, expressed his condolences to the family and friends of those killed.\n\n\u201cI am now convinced that as many as 10 civilians, including up to seven children, were tragically killed in that strike,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cMoreover, we now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K or were a direct threat to U.S. forces,\u201d he added, referring to the Islamic State group\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate.\n\nPrior to the strike, U.S. intelligence had indicated a likelihood that a white Toyota Corolla would be used in an attack against U.S. forces, McKenzie said. On the morning of Aug. 29, such a vehicle was detected at a compound in Kabul that U.S. intelligence in the preceding 48 hours had determined was used by the Islamic State group to plan and facilitate attacks. The vehicle was tracked by U.S. drone aircraft from that compound to numerous other locations in the city before the decision was made to attack it at a point just a couple of miles from Kabul airport, McKenzie said.\n\n\u201cClearly our intelligence was wrong on this particular white Toyota Corolla,\u201d he said.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a written statement, apologized for what he called \u201ca horrible mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe now know that there was no connection\u201d between the driver of the vehicle and the Islamic State group, and that the driver\u2019s activities that day were \u201ccompletely harmless and not at all related to the imminent threat we believed we faced,\u201d Austin said.\n\nGen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters two days after the attack that it appeared to have been a \u201crighteous\u201d strike and that at least one of the people killed was a \u201cfacilitator\u201d for the Islamic State group\u2019s Afghanistan affiliate, which had killed 169 Afghan civilians and 13 American service members in a suicide bombing on Aug. 26 at the Kabul airport.\n\nAfter McKenzie\u2019s remarks on Friday, Milley expressed regret.\n\n\u201cThis is a horrible tragedy of war and it\u2019s heart wrenching,\u201d Milley told reporters traveling with him in Europe. \u201cWe are committed to being fully transparent about this incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a dynamic high-threat environment, the commanders on the ground had appropriate authority and had reasonable certainty that the target was valid, but after deeper post-strike analysis our conclusion is that innocent civilians were killed,\u201d Milley added.\n\nAccounts from the family of the victims, documents from colleagues seen by The Associated Press, and the scene at the family home \u2014 where Zemerai Ahmadi\u2019s car was struck by a Hellfire missile just as he pulled into the driveway \u2014 all painted a picture of a family that had worked for Americans and were trying to gain visas to the United States, fearing for their lives under the Taliban.\n\nThe family said that when the 37-year-old Zemerai, alone in his car, pulled up to the house, he honked his horn. His 11-year-old son ran out and Zemerai let the boy get in and drive the car into the driveway. The other kids ran out to watch, and the Hellfire missile incinerated the car, killing seven children and an adult son and nephew of Zemerai.\n\nAmnesty International, the humanitarian aid group, called the U.S. military\u2019s admission of a mistake a good first step.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. must now commit to a full, transparent, and impartial investigation into this incident,\u201d said Brian Castner, a senior crisis adviser with Amnesty International. \u201cAnyone suspected of criminal responsibility should be prosecuted in a fair trial. Survivors and families of the victims should be kept informed of the progress of the investigation and be given full reparation.\u201d\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said a fuller explanation must be provided.\n\n\u201cWe need to know what went wrong in the hours and minutes leading up to the strike to prevent similar tragedies in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cI am also concerned about the accuracy and completeness of public statements made in the immediate aftermath of the strike, and whether those accounted for all of the information possessed by the government at the time.\u201d",

          "title": "In Escalation Over Submarine Deal, France Recalls Envoys from US and Australia",
          "text": "France plunged into an unprecedented diplomatic crisis with the United States and Australia on Friday after it recalled its ambassadors from both countries over a trilateral security deal which sank a French-designed submarine contract with Canberra.\n\nThe rare decision taken by French President Emmanuel Macron was made due to the \u201cexceptional gravity\u201d of the matter, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement.\n\nOn Thursday, Australia said it would scrap a $40 billion deal signed in 2016 for France\u2019s Naval Group to build a fleet of conventional submarines and would instead build at least eight nuclear-powered submarines with U.S. and British technology after striking a trilateral security partnership. France called it a stab in the back.\n\nA diplomatic source in France said it was the first time Paris had recalled its own ambassadors in this way.\n\nAustralia said on Saturday morning it regretted the recall, and that it valued the relationship with France and would keep engaging with Paris on other issues.\n\n\u201cAustralia understands France\u2019s deep disappointment with our decision, which was taken in accordance with our clear and communicated national security interests,\u201d a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said that France was a \u2018vital ally\u2019 and that the United States would be engaged in coming days to resolve the differences.\n\nThe French foreign ministry statement made no mention of Britain, but the diplomatic source said France considered Britain had joined the deal in an opportunistic manner.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to hold consultations with our (British) ambassador to know what to make of it or to draw any conclusions,\u201d the source added.\n\nLe Drian said the deal was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThe cancellation (of the project) \u2026 and the announcement of a new partnership with the United States meant to launch studies on a possible future cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines, constitute unacceptable behavior between allies and partners,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHe added that the consequences \u201cdirectly affect the vision we have of our alliances, of our partnerships and of the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe.\u201d\n\nLOW POINT\n\nThe row marks the lowest point in relations between Australia and France since 1995, when Canberra protested France\u2019s decision to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific and recalled its ambassador for consultations.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday rejected French criticism that it had not been warned about the new deal, and said he had raised the possibility in talks with the French president that Australia might scrap the Naval Group deal.\n\nMorrison insisted he had told Macron in June that Australia had revised its thinking.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear, we had a lengthy dinner there in Paris, about our very significant concerns about the capabilities of conventional submarines to deal with the new strategic environment we\u2019re faced with,\u201d he told 5aa Radio.\n\n\u201cI made it very clear that this was a matter that Australia would need to make a decision on in our national interest.\u201d\n\nThe strain in multilateral ties come as the United States and its allies seek additional support in Asia and the Pacific given concern about the rising influence of a more assertive China.\n\nFrance is about to take over the presidency of the European Union, which on Thursday released its strategy for the Indo-Pacific, pledging to seek a trade deal with Taiwan and to deploy more ships to keep sea routes open.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken tried on Thursday to calm the French outcry, calling France a vital partner in the region.\n\nPierre Morcos, a visiting fellow at Washington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies, called France\u2019s move \u201chistoric.\u201d\n\n\u201cReassuring words such as those heard yesterday from Secretary Blinken are not enough for Paris \u2013 especially after French authorities learned that this agreement was months in the making,\u201d he said.",
