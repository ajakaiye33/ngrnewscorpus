          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201curgently recover missing N105.7bn of public funds from ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to fund the country\u2019s public tertiary institutions, improve the welfare of staff members, and ensure that the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) return to class without further delay.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cPending the recovery of the missing public funds, we urge you to redirect some of the presidency\u2019s budget of N3.6 billion on feeding and travels, and the N134 billion allocated to the National Assembly in the 2022 budget to meet the demands by ASUU.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201csend to the National Assembly a fresh supplementary appropriation bill, which reflects the proposed redirected budget, for its approval.\n\nIn the letter dated 2 July, 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cMeeting the demands by ASUU would confront the persistent and widening inequality in educational opportunity, and promote equal protection for poor Nigerian children.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe apparent failure by your government to agree with the reasonable demands by ASUU, implement the good faith agreement with the union and to satisfactorily resolve the issues has kept poor Nigerian children at home while the children of the country\u2019s politicians attend private schools.\u201d\n\nThe ASUU accused the government of poor commitment to the payment of academic earned allowance (EAA); poor funding, the continued use of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System and refusal to adopt the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), among others.\n\nSERAP said, \u201cMeeting ASUU demands would also ensure protection against the harms of discrimination and educational deprivation.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cThe poor treatment of Nigerian children in the country\u2019s public tertiary institutions is inconsistent and incompatible with the Nigerian Constitution and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWidening inequalities in the area of education bear all the more dramatic consequences given the importance of education, as an empowering right, in giving the possibility to all to explore and realise their potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cInequalities in education have a rolling effect, leading to even more and continued inequalities in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from being a right in itself, the right to education is also an enabling right. Education creates the \u2018voice\u2019 through which rights can be claimed and protected, and without education people lack the capacity to achieve valuable functioning as part of the living.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people have access to education they can develop the skills, capacity and confidence to secure other rights. Education gives people the ability to access information detailing the range of rights that they hold, and government\u2019s obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within seven days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovering the missing N105.7bn of public funds and redirecting the funds, as well as some parts of the presidency and National Assembly budgets to meet the demands by ASUU would end the protracted negotiations between ASUU and the Federal Government and improve access of poor children to education.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovering the missing N105.7bn of public funds and redirecting the funds, as well as some parts of the presidency and National Assembly budgets to meet the demands by ASUU would also be in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed spending of taxpayers\u2019 and public funds would also be consistent with constitutional responsibilities and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovering the missing N105.7bn of public funds and redirecting the funds, as well as some parts of the presidency and National Assembly would be entirely consistent with your constitutional oath of office, and with the letter and spirit of the Nigerian Constitution, as it would promote equal opportunities for poor children who rely on public schools and have no opportunity for university education elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that Nigeria\u2019s public tertiary institutions have continued to experience a steady decline. The quality of public education offered is low and standards have continued to drop. The learning environment does not promote effective learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic school facilities are in a state of extreme disrepair, requiring major rehabilitation. Basic teaching and learning resources are generally not available, leaving many lecturers and other staff members profoundly demoralized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure to end the ASUU strike has hugely contributed to denying poor Nigerian children access to quality education, opportunities and development. The enjoyment of the right to education for millions of poor children remains a distant goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder international law, states are required to progressively implement socio-economic rights including the right to quality education commensurate with the level of resources available. Gross misallocation of resources to the detriment of the enjoyment of the right to quality education can constitute a human rights violation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA violation of the right to education will occur when there is insufficient expenditure or misallocation of public resources which results in the non-enjoyment of access to education by poor Nigerian children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure to meet the reasonable demands by ASUU cannot be justified especially given the failure and/or refusal by the Federal Government to recover trillions of Naira reportedly missing in ministries, departments and agencies, and the huge funds allocated to the presidency and the National Assembly in the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, N105.7bn of public funds are missing, as documented by the Auditor-General of the Federation in his annual audited report for 2018. Also, while the presidency has budgeted N3.6 billion for feeding and travels, N134 billion has been allocated to the National Assembly in the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, ASUU and other university workers\u2019 unions have been on strike for several months. The unions\u2019 demands, among other things, include better funding for the nation\u2019s public tertiary institutions and improved welfare for their members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile your government has reportedly released N34 billion for the payment of minimum wage consequential adjustments from 2019, ASUU has maintained that until its core demands are met, it will not suspend the strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn protest of the continuous use of IPPIS and refusal by the Federal Government to implement the renegotiated 2009 agreement that was completed in May 2021, ASUU resumed nationwide strike on February 14.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Why we collaborate \u2013 Durkwa\n\nBy Ndahi Marama, Maiduguri\n\nLast week, opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders from Southern Borno held a strategic meeting in neighboring Gombe State. The meeting saw the influx of APC defectors into the party.\n\nThe meeting had in attendance notable figures of the PDP including the Borno governorship candidate, Mohammed Jajari.\n\nOther top names at the meeting include Southern Borno leader, Mr Nicholas Msheliza, and Alhaji Idris Durkwa, who recently defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to the PDP.\n\nMsheliza, who chaired the meeting, is a member of the National Executive Committee, NEC, of the PDP.\n\nThe meeting was convened at the instance of Durkwa to fraternize and strategize on how to deliver the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and all those vying for political positions on the platform of the party in the 2023 general elections.\n\nDurkwa was a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the APC in the 2018 primary election that produced Governor Babagana Zulum as candidate in Borno and finished second position.\n\nBut before his defection to the PDP, he had also aspired for the Southern Borno senatorial ticket on the platform of the APC but edged out in an exercise alleged not only riddled with malpractices but also an imposition in favour of incumbent Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume.\n\nDurkwa stormed the Gombe meeting accompanied by all his 2018 Gubernatorial Campaign Coordinators (GCCs) from across the 27 local government areas of Borno, 2022 Senatorial Campaign Coordinators (SCCs) and thousands of supporters who altogether joined the PDP.\n\nAlso at the meeting was a former member of Borno State House of Assembly, Hon Fali Wabilari, who represented Askira-Uba Constituency. He also recently defected from the APC to the PDP.\n\nSunday Vanguard reliably gathered that the purpose of the meeting was to officially welcome new members into the party and inspire the spirit of change in a manner that PDP wins all elective positions come 2023.\n\nCentral to the discussion was how to position Atiku, Jajari, all the senatorial candidates in Gombe and Borno, House of Representatives and House of Assembly flag bearers for victory ahead of the forthcoming general elections.\n\nWhile declaring the meeting open, Msheliza expressed delight for having Durkwa and his teeming supporters into the unstoppable ship of the PDP.\n\nAccording to the PDP NEC member, the coming of Durkwa, Wabilari and host of others was a sign of good things that would happen not only to the people of Southern Borno but also the entire Borno and the country as a whole in 2023.\n\nHe assured that the PDP will work assiduously to ensure victory for its candidates at all levels, even as he urged all those who are yet to obtain their Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to immediately do so.\n\nIn his remarks, Borno PDP Chairman, Hon Zannah Gadama, who was invited to witness the meeting, but was represented by the State Organizing Secretary, Umar Bello, welcomed all new members and promised that the party will carry everybody along in discharging its responsibilities without discrimination.\n\nAccording to him, the time has come for all members of the PDP to unite for a common front to take over the mantle of leadership at the national, state and local government levels because average Nigerians are disenchanted with the APC that has through its anti-people economic policies inflicted hardship on the masses.\n\nHe said with the coming of political heavyweights like Durkwa and his teeming supporters into the PDP, the party has a better chance to win all elective positions at the local, state and national levels come 2023.\n\nThe Chairman claimed that the many years of APC rule in Borno has inflicted untold hardship on the people.\n\n\u201cWe have all said that Nigerians, and Borno people, in particular, are waiting for PDP to take over in 2023. That is true. But we cannot take over if we are not united. We cannot take over if we don\u2019t work together,\u201d he said.\n\nDurkwa, who was the convener of the meeting, delivered a thought-provoking speech at the gathering.\n\nHe noted that APC\u2019s poor governance is manifest in widespread poverty, insecurity, poor electricity supply, scarcity of petroleum products and insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWe in Borno are the worst-hit victims of the APC misrule because it has been a one-party system where they chose to deal with our people in a bad light\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, a time has come for us to put our house in order and make our people proud come 2023 by ensuring that our presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, our gubernatorial candidate in Borno, Mohammed Jajari, and all other PDP flag bearers come out victorious.\u201d\n\nDurkwa restated that the reason for his defection from the APC was injustice that characterized his former party. He said lack of respect and non-compliance with the 2022 Electoral Act Provisions by the powers-that-be in Borno State APC against the clamour for positive change, necessitated his defection.\n\nDurkwa equally cited that the political narratives in Southern Borno which, according to him, need urgent change for the people of the senatorial district to feel the dividends of democracy at the centre.\n\n\u201cAs a democrat, the time has come for me and my teeming supporters to join forces with the major opposition party (PDP) which is determined to wrest power come 2023, especially in Southern Borno Senatorial District\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe majority of our people in the constituency are glaringly clamoring for change, because of the poor representation by their lawmakers in the National Assembly in the past decade, and that is what informed my decision to join the united front.\n\n\u201cI have formally come to pay my respect to the PDP which is the only opposition party to beat come 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t join the PDP alone, but I moved in with all my teeming supporters across the 27 local government areas of Borno state, and I urge all of us to remain united for a common goal of rescuing our people from the APC misrule.\n\n\u201cI am here with my teeming supporters. We will work together and contribute in our maximum way to ensure that our presidential candidate, a former Vice President of Nigeria (GCON), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and indeed all our candidates vying for various political positions on the platform of our great party win with unprecedented victory come 2023.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to thank all my teeming supporters who have also joined the promising and the unstoppable train, in continuation of our unflinching/maximum support and cooperation to ensure we all reach the promised land\u201d.\n\nFew days after the meeting, the candidate for House of Assembly representing Biu State Constituency, Hon Aliyu Mamman Kachallah, popularly known as Opanka, stormed Biu and was received by tumultuous supporters from both ruling APC and PDP. Biu is the town of the current Deputy Governor, Alhaji Umar Kadafur.\n\nOpanka, a grassroots politician, was a House of Assembly aspirant on the platform of the APC, but was shortchange during the primary that favoured the incumbent, Hon Yakubu Kimba, due to imposition factor, after which he (Opanka) also defected to the PDP.",

Report them when they occur and act in a lawful manner to stop them\u201d, he admonished.\n\nBuhari further explained for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises that drive economic growth, the 55-kilometre road is also a statement of economic efficiency and ease of doing business.\n\n\u201cThis is because the travel time before the construction has reduced since the completion of this road.\n\nHe reminded motorists and other road users plying the new road that, the maximum driving speed on the road and other federal highways nationwide is 100 kilometres per hour.\n\n\u201cFor your safety and that of other road users, I implore you not to exceed 100 kilometres per hour. We want you alive to witness and be part of the prosperity and promise of Nigeria\u201d, he appealed.",

          "text": "Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), on Sunday, asked the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, to stop mulling the possibility of a Muslim as his vice-presidential candidate.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, stressed that the emergence of a Muslim-Muslim ticket presidency will further heighten the aggression against Christians by bandits and terrorists who claim allegiance to Islam.\n\nThe group said the alleged move by the APC is unconstitutional and violates Section 14 (3) and (4) and Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which specifically states that the principle of federal character should be reflected in the composition of the government and that no group, religious or ethnic, should dominate the other.\n\nReports making the rounds suggest that Tinubu may in the next few days name either Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State or Senator Kashim Shettima, as his running mate to beat the July 15 deadline by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nThe report said about 13 Muslim northern governors are pressuring Tinubu to choose them because they backed his candidacy during the fiercely-contested APC primary.\n\nReacting, however, HURIWA\u2019s Onwubiko said, \u201cIt is crucial to warn APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, for the umpteenth time to stop his sinister plot to nominate a Muslim running mate. The nomination will endanger national unity and will divide Nigeria irretrievably. If Tinubu goes on with a Muslim running mate, the APC should just forget about Nigeria because religious war will break out and Nigeria\u2019s case will be worse than Somalia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWith President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim from Katsina State, who is obviously not concerned about the terrorist attacks on Christians, what will happen when Nigeria has Muslim-Muslim Presidency? It means an Islamic state would be declared and war will kick-off!\n\n\u201cHURIWA urges Nigerians to reject the APC or any party that wants to foist same religion ticket on a heterogeneous and multi-religious people like Nigerians. What happens to a Muslim-Christian ticket? What happens to a Christian-Muslim ticket? If a Christian-Christian ticket can\u2019t work, then, a Muslim-Muslim ticket should never work! Nigerians should reject such parties with their Permanent Voter Cards!\n\n\u201cSection 38 of the 1999 constitution recognizes all religions while Section 318 and Section 14 (3) and (4) succinctly back the principle of federal character and resist the domination of a group in the composition of the government.\n\n\u201dFor instance, Section 318 states: \u201cfederal character of Nigeria\u201d refers to the distinctive desire of the peoples of Nigeria to promote national unity, foster national loyalty and give every citizen of Nigeria a sense of belonging to the nation as expressed in section 14 (3) and (4) of this constitution;\n\n\u201cSection 14 (3) and (4) states: The composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few State or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or in any of its agencies.\n\n\u201c(4) The composition of the Government of a State, a local government council, or any of the agencies of such Government or council, and the conduct of the affairs of the Government or council or such agencies shall be carried out in such manner as to recognise the diversity of the people within its area of authority and the need to promote a sense of belonging and loyalty among all the people of the Federation.\u201d\n\nHURIWA also warned the Yakubu Mahmoud- led Independent National Electoral Commission not to play with fire by pandering to the whims and caprices of the ruling party but to conduct transparent, free, fair elections or else be prepared for war because the 2023 poll is the determinant factor if Nigeria will exist or burn to ashes and any attempt to manipulate the poll to favour the APC will be actively resisted for a long time to come just as the Rights group expressed doubts if Nigeria would survive any post-election war.",

          "title": "Women inclusion, key to unlocking potential of oil and gas industry The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "The oil and gas industry is the mainstay of Nigeria\u2019s economy, providing thousands of direct and indirect jobs and contributing substantially to the nation\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nIt is a known fact that oil alone accounts for 40 per cent of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 70 per cent of budget revenues and 95 per cent of foreign exchange earnings.\n\nDespite the invaluable contribution of the sector to the economy, experts believe that it still has huge potential, and that there is need for deliberate inclusion of women in the sector to unlock the potential.\n\nHowever, the industry remains male-dominated at all levels; from leadership roles in major corporations to jobs in mines and on oil rigs.\n\nAccording to a recent study by the Global Energy Talent Index, whereas women make up 48 per cent of the global labour force, they only account for 22 per cent of the labour force in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe study said women occupied about 50 per cent of non-technical positions at entry-level compared to only 15 per cent of technical and field role positions.\n\n\u201cThis implies that the gender diversity and inclusion decreases with seniority, with only a tiny proportion of women in executive positions.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of women in the industry drops from 36 per cent to 24 per cent between the middle and executive levels,\u201d the study added.\n\nIn Nigeria, women have been pushing for more inclusion in the energy space and are beginning to make progress despite the socio-economic, political and cultural challenges.\n\nFor instance, Mrs Elohor Aiboni, was in March 2021 appointed as the first female Managing Director of Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Ltd. (SNEPCO).\n\nSimilarly, President Muhammadu Buhari, in January 2022 appointed Sen. Margery Chuba-Okadigbo as the pioneer Board Chairman of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd.\n\nChief Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, said the Federal Government had been deliberate in introducing gender-friendly policies that would promote women inclusion in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSylva, who spoke at a recent Nigerian Women in Oil and Gas Conference in Lagos, said this included increasing access to funding, award of contracts and support for research and development in the interest of women operators in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nThe minister harped on the need to get more girls into Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), which was a pathway to careers in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe also advised women in the Nigerian oil and gas industry to work together towards increasing participation of women in the industry by engendering growth, building capacities and capabilities, identifying opportunities, mentoring and coaching.\n\nAlso, Mr Simbi Wabote, Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), recently announced that the board would soon begin the disbursement of the 40 million dollar Women in Energy Fund to support women in the sector.\n\nWabote said the fund was set up by the NCDMB in partnership with the Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM Bank), adding that 15 applications had been received and three had been approved for disbursement.\n\nHe also canvassed the inclusion of women in the administration of the various Trusts and Funds that were established by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, notably the Host Community Development Trust, Host Community Development Trust Fund and Environmental Remediation Fund.\n\nThe NCDMB boss further confirmed that the Oil and Gas Industrial Parks in Bayelsa and Cross River were getting ready for completion and would commence operations in 2023.\n\nHe noted that the board had started inviting applicants for allocation of plots to set up manufacturing outfits in the park and encouraged women-owned businesses with workable proposals to apply.\n\nWabote promised that women would be given special consideration as part of the board\u2019s commitment to mainstream them into the oil and gas industry.\n\nOn her part, Chuba-Okadigbo has challenged the NCDMB to institute a development programme like the Project 100 for oil and gas firms owned by women.\n\nShe said the implementation of the PIA provided a good opportunity to mainstream more women in oil and gas activities and also recommended formal mentorship and role modelling for younger women.\n\nWhile the recent appointments of Chuba-Okadigbo and Aiboni are quite significant, experts believe that there is a lot that still need to be done for inclusion of more women in the oil and gas industry.\n\nMrs Funmi Ogbue, President, Women in Energy Network, insists that government at all levels should promote women leadership in the energy sector by appointing more women to head agencies and institutions at sectional, regional and international levels.\n\nOgbue said this would help bridge the gap in the sector, while also giving more women opportunities to contribute their quota to national development.\n\nAlso, Mrs Anita Ogboile, Chief Executive Officer, Deep Blue Energy, said there was need to create awareness of STEM and its importance to younger females, especially those in secondary schools.\n\nOgboile said demystifying the myth that women would not succeed in the industry was very key and would help encourage others to go into the sector.\n\nIndeed, the exploits of women in the oil and gas sector holds brighter prospects for the sector, and invariably the economy.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "Developers found guilty of violating the land use of any area in Abuja, may have to start paying for the cost of demolishing their own properties, as the Administration has threatened to begin implementation of environmental laws which stipulates financial penalties on offenders.\n\nThe Coordinator of the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council, (AMMC), Tpl. Shuaibu Umar, who disclosed this while briefing reporters at the weekend, said the measure has become necessary following the numerous abuse of building regulations as well as town planning violations.\n\nUmar, who also blamed erring developers for the rate of flooding witnessed in Abuja in recent times, said most of the flood disasters in recorded in Abuja results from buildings erected on flood plains.\n\nThe FCT has in recent times been inundated with reports of flooding around Lokogoma, Trademore Estate, Lugbe, among another communities, with number of lives and property lost to flash flooding.\n\nThe AMMC coordinator, while answering questions from reporters, said when implemented, the development will save government huge cost of logistics and also serve as deterrent to recalcitrant developers.\n\nIn his words: \u201cWe have a provision in the Urban and Regional Planning Law as well as provisions in the environmental law that establish the Abuja Environmental Protection Board which allows for prosecution of developers that violate building requirements and regulations.\n\n\u201cThe law empowers us to enforce, demolish and prosecute. The law also allows us to charge erring developers to reimburse the authority all the expenses spent during that demolition.\n\n\u201cSo we are going to commence implementation this law. Any developer found guilty of violating land use of any area, we demolish, prosecute and make sure he reimburse our enforcement. In a situation where public infrastructure like bridges or roads are destroyed, we will also charge the developer to pay for whatever he may have destroyed in the course of violation of our regulation.\u201d\n\nOn the pace of demolitions across the territory in recent times, the coordinator maintained that government can not afford to sit back and watch people putting their lives and that of others at risk.\n\nUmar said: \u201cwe are not demolishing because we want to, we are demolishing because we have to protect people\u2019s lives. If people do not value their lives, we have the responsibility to protect it for them.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the FCT Administration, through its relevant agencies, has played its part in ensuring that the city\u2019s land use are adhered to in all neighbourhood.\n\nAccording to him, the city\u2019s planner perfected a plan and made sure that: \u201clands on flood plains are never allocated but what we have today are recalcitrant developers that encroach on green areas. I can categorically say that almost all the areas presently threatened by flood are illegal development.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because we are not taking measures, because every time we notice an illegal development or infractions, our officers move in, stop work and mark such buildings and serve them demolition notices.\u201d",

We urge you all to be non-partisan, and not to engage in any party activities.\n\n\u201cYour right is to vote, get your PVC, do your vote, go back to your home.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect that you engage in any electioneering process. Any person found engaged in that will be severely sanctioned,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Navy will continue to support you by way of providing all the needs to function optimally in the area of your responsibilities,\u201d the CNS said.\n\nGambo, while noting the various security challenges bedevilling the country, said the route march is aimed at developing the physical and mental alertness of personnel to meet the dynamics of contemporary security operations.\n\nHe also said it is targeted at fostering esprit de corps and providing an avenue for relaxation.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is important to state that, operational efficiency and combat readiness are predicated on mental and physical fitness of the armed forces.

          "title": "PDP crisis: Real reasons Wike is angry with Atiku",
          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, tension is mounting in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as controversies have continued to trail the nomination of Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the party\u2019s vice presidential candidate.\n\nPDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, recently unveiled Okowa as his running mate for the 2023 general elections.\n\nPrior to the unveiling of Okowa, the special panel set up by the PDP to shop for a suitable running mate for Atiku had reportedly voted in favour of Wike as the opposition party\u2019s vice presidential candidate by 14 votes to three.\n\nNevertheless, the panel, which consisted of members and representatives of the PDP National Working Committee ( NWC), Governors Forum, Board of Trustees ( BoT), former Ministers Forum recommended Wike, Okowa and the Akwa Ibom governor, Udom Emmanuel as probable vice presidential candidates. But Atiku on his own settled for the Delta governor. Atiku had polled a total of 371 votes, at the PDP convention, to defeat Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, who scored 237 votes, and 11 others.\n\nHowever, there have been unease in the opposition party, since the Delta governor\u2019s unveiling as its vice presidential candidate, as neither the PDP nor Atiku has known peace.\n\nLoyalists of Wike are of the view that he ought to have been chosen as the PDP vice presidential candidate as favoured by the panel. According to them, since the majority of the members of the panel set up to shop for a vice presidential candidate voted for him, he ought to have been selected as Atiku\u2019s running mate.\n\nHowever, while Wike has kept sealed lips over the turn of events, party stakeholders are apprehensive over the likely effect, especially the misgivings the issues surrounding the PDP vice presidential slot might have on the party\u2019s campaign for the 2023 general elections.\n\nSunday Sun gathered that the crisis has polarized the various organs of the party, including the National Working Committee ( NWC), as well as the PDP Governors Forum, with different groups queuing behind Wike and Atiku/the PDP leadership.\n\nIn the aftermath of the selection of Okowa as Atiku\u2019s running mate, PDP governors have kept away from subsequent party functions. Multiple sources say the failure of the opposition party to hold its grand rally prior to the just concluded Ekiti State governorship poll, as well as the party abysmal performance in the poll is not unconnected to the vice presidential candidate controversy.\n\nLast Tuesday, 11 PDP governors stayed away from the inauguration of the party\u2019s National Campaign Council for the Osun State governorship poll. The governors who were absent included: Nyesom Wike, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Samuel Ortom, Seyi Makinde of Rivers, Enugu, Abia, Benue and Oyo states respectively.\n\nOthers absent at the event included the Chairman of the Campaign Council and Bayelsa State governor, Diri Douye; Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed; Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki, Akwa Ibom state governor, Udom Emmanuel and Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri. Incidentally, they are all members of the 128-man campaign council.\n\nIndications that the majority of the governors are not happy with Atiku and the PDP came to the fore last week as the Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, in a television interview said that Wike and his supporters deserve an explanation from Atiku on why he was not chosen as the party\u2019s vice presidential candidate.\n\nOrtom had said: \u201cI expect him(Atiku) to reach out to Wike, who came second and he denied the popular view of PDP members; 14 out of 17, saying that Wike should be the VP. In his wisdom, he choose that it should be Governor Okowa. Governor Okowa is a nice man. I have no problem with him. If we are in a democratic era and 14 people out of 17 say it should be Wike and he in his wisdom gave it to Okowa, I expect more explanations. I expect him to talk to Wike first, that we are supporting. I expect him to even reach out to some of us. So that together we can work as a party.\u201d\n\nA member of the House of Representatives from Rivers State, Solomon Bob, told Sunday Sun in a telephone interview, that Atiku had offered the Rivers State governor the vice presidential slot, immediately after the national convention. He stated that it was surprising that the former vice president would turn round to choose someone else.\n\nBob noted: \u201cA day after the convention, Atiku went to Wike to appeal to him to be his running mate. Wike asked for time to consult. Wike never wanted to become running mate to anyone. Atiku was the one who made the offer to him, after the convention. That was what happened.\n\n\u201cHe ( Wike) consulted. He was persuaded to accept. And he said okay, we can work together. The same man (Atiku) went back on his offer and passed through the party, the party also voted for the person he has made the offer to earlier on. Unknown to anyone else, he (Atiku) had a secret joker in his mind.\n\n\u201cHe was the one who went to him with the offer of a running mate. Wike\u2019s anger is the deception. That is not how things are done. His anger is about the man\u2019s behaviour. No one compelled him to make that offer.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, who expressed fear that the issue if not properly handled will spell doom for the opposition party, advised Atiku to reach out to the Rivers governor and appeal to him.\n\n\u201cIf it is not handled properly, it portends failure in 2023. That is what it portends. Atiku has to come down from his horse. He is not a president yet. He must not forget that. And he is not vying on the platform of the party in power. He is vying on the platform of the opposition. He has to come down from his high horse and enter into concrete agreement with Wike. Beg him. He has to beg Wike.\n\n\u201cWike is the PDP biggest factor, including in the North. He knows that. But for the last minute eleventh hour game they played, Wike would have won the primary. Wike is PDP biggest factor. If Wike leaves PDP today, he is not leaving alone. Wike has capacity to tear PDP from top to bottom. But he is not going to do that. He is a party man. But Atiku has to learn to be humble.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, media aide to Atiku, Paul Ibe, said that the issue of whether or not the PDP presidential candidate asked Wike to be his running mate should not be the issue for now. Ibe stated that the concern of every well-meaning member of the opposition party should be how to wrest power from the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwith the conclusion of the nomination process, every well-meaning member, stakeholders and leader of the PDP should be preoccupied or should be concerned about how the party can move forward, united to be able to wrestle power from the APC. That should be the preoccupation.\n\n\u201cThis argument of who was offered what, should not be the subject for now. It does not serve the interest of the party and it will not serve the interest of Nigerians, who are anxiously looking on the leadership of the PDP be to able to save this party from the ruins of the APC.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ibe said that the former vice president has noted all the complaints by aggrieved members of the party, adding that all the issues would be resolved.\n\n2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice ... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice presidential candidate\n\n\u201cHis Excellency Atiku Abubakar heard them loud and clear. Even before the complaints were made public, His Excellency has started the process of uniting the party. The process of mediation, of engaging. First of all starting with those who contested with him. \u201cHe visited them. He had discussion with them. He has also been in touch with other leaders and stakeholders. It is a continuous engagement. It is not a one off thing. He has upped it since the end of nomination process that had produced grievances in some quarters. All of the issues would be resolved before the 2023 elections. You can be assured of that, \u201c he stated.\n\nHowever, the noose seems to be tightening around the PDP national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, as aggrieved members of the party are accusing him of alleged bias in the process leading to the emergence of the PDP presidential candidate and the running mate.\n\nCritics are quick to point to Ayu\u2019s visit to the Abuja residence of the Sokoto State governor, and his stance that the panel set up to shop for a vice presidential candidate did not in favour any person as evidence of his alleged bias.\n\nThe PDP chairman, a day after the national convention, had visited Tambuwal in company of former Jigawa State governor, Sule Lamido. In a video clip on the visit, Ayu was heard hailing the Sokoto governor as the hero of the convention. In the video clip, which was also shared online, Ayu was seen patting Tambuwal\u2019s back and saying, \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you. You are the hero of the convention.\u201d\n\nBut, the PDP chairman said that the allegation of bias does not hold water as the party gave every aspirant a level playing ground. Ayu, who spoke through his Special Assistant on Communication and Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said that his visit to Tambuwal\u2019s residence does not remove anything from the credibility and intergrity of the national convention.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhen Dr Ayu became the chairman of the party, he was clear about giving everyone a level playing field. At every forum, he emphasised that the NWC which he leads was going to be very impartial, so that the best candidate emerges in a very transparent manner that doesn\u2019t give room for contentions and misinterpretation. And to a large extent, that was what Dr Iyorchia Ayu did.\n\n\u201cIf you recall the day that our flag bearer was here to address the NWC on his aspiration. And the chairman told him clearly that we have been friends and we have come a long way, but I will not work for you, Mr Atiku Abubakar as an aspirant. But when you win the election, and become our flag bearer, I will market you. I will stand by you. Right now, you are just like any other aspirant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it that the national chairman was partisan. The convention was free, fair, credible and transparent.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t condemn him for describing someone who exercises his freedom (as hero of the convention). What the chairman is alleged to have said does not take away from the transparency, from the integrity and the credibility of the convention.\u201d\n\nImobo-Tswam further stated that it would be unfair for anyone to hold the national chairman responsible for Atiku\u2019s choice of running mate. He said that it was imperative to note that the terms of reference of the panel set to shop for a running mate was not to choose a particular person, but to make recommendations to the presidential candidate, who has the final say.\n\n\u201cI should think that the party asked the panel to recommend three names to the candidate so that he will now shop the person that suits him.\n\n\u201cIf candidate A name was binding, why send three names. People are being unfair to the national chairman, because he is not the candidate. Once a candidate emerges the issue of choosing his running mate, of course, he will consult the caucuses, but the final decision of who runs with him is personal to him. Atiku Abubakar is the candidate of the party. Only him have the final say on who runs with him. Not Dr Iyorchia Ayu.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Sunday Sun gathered that the aggrieved party leaders are unrelenting in their quest to sack Ayu as party chairman. Those behind the plot, it was gathered, had met severally in Abuja, last week, to perfect their plots. A party source disclosed that one of the meetings was held in Asokoro last Tuesday night.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cI can confirm to you that there are plots. Meetings are being held. Plans are ongoing to move against him. Once they get the required number, they will pass a vote of no confidence in him.\n\n\u201cMost of the NWC members are not happy the way he (Ayu) handled the vice presidential candidate issue. After eminent persons voted in favour of Wike. They want to implode the party. And it is not good for us.\u201d",

          "text": "By By Enyeribe Ejiogu, Olakunle Olafioye, Daniel Kanu (Lagos), John Adams (Minna), Paul Osuyi (Asaba), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Tony Osauzo and Ighomuaye Lucky (Benin), Sylvanus Viashima (Jalingo), Noah Ebije (Kaduna), Rose Ejembi (Makurdi), Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri) and Okey Sampson (Umuahia)\n\nThe dust raised by the call of the Zamfara State governor, Dr Bello Matawalle, on the residents of the state to acquire arms to defend themselves against \u201cbandits\u201d that have besieged communities across the state is still swirling and may not settle anytime soon.\n\nThe governor\u2019s call, a seeming last ditch effort, struck a chord that resonated in the mid of the people of Benue, who for long had been at the receiving end of the murderous bandits, who have turned the whole communities into fields of blood as they killed men, women, children and even slitting the tummies of pregnant women, as well as burning houses, destroying farmlands, sacking the communities and turning the residents into internal refugees.\n\nFor Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, Matawalle\u2019s call was essentially an adoption of the Benue option, when in 2019 he advised residents of the state to defend themselves against armed invaders.\n\nOrtom had at a recent interaction with journalists in Makurdi renewed the call on the people of the state to get arms and be ready to defend themselves against any form of violent hostilities.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe renewed killings and attack will not stop us from doing the right thing. We are not against anybody. But this intimidation must stop. I already told my people to arm themselves because the Bible also allows us to defend ourselves. And those who kill by the sword should die by the sword. Those who kill by AK-47 or whatever means, should also die by AK47.\n\n\u201cI have told my people, don\u2019t waste your time, don\u2019t wait for anybody to kill you, kill that person first. That\u2019s is my stand.\u201d\n\nAlso, both the President General of Tiv Socio-Cultural Organisation, Mzough-U-Tiv (MUT) Worldwide, Chief Iorbee Ihagh (rtd CP) as well as the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Benue State chapter, Rev. Akpen Leva have severally called on the people of the state to defend themselves against gunmen who have consistently invaded their territories.\n\nThey urged the people that rather than run away from their attackers who come to kill, maim and destroy their ancestral homes, they should adequately arm themselves enough to be able to face them instead.\n\nA security expert, Mr Paul Elimbi, characterised the directive of Matawalle to Zamfara people in this way: \u201cWhen a governor makes such statement, it means he has lost faith in the system which constitutionally has the duty and function to protect the people. That means the system has failed. Secondly, it means the world of crime is having an upper hand. It shows that the government is bereft of creativity and initiative to deal with the situation.\n\n\u201cThird, so many people will be sent to early graves because they are not well equipped to handle such situation due to government\u2019s helplessness. The governor is indirectly telling the people that he could not help them, therefore, they should help themselves. It means the government has failed. But when you tell the people to get their own weapons and protect themselves against criminal elements that to me, amounts to further encouraging lawlessness. The state governor, by such pronouncement is institutionalizing disorder and criminality. This goes to show that the government has lost its initiative and it\u2019s helpless.\u201d\n\nThough the position of the Edo State government is that it would not follow the example of Zamfara and Benue states, notable voices in the state have dismissed the state government\u2019s seeming display of the attitude of the ostrich, which pretends to hide its head in the sand.\n\nSpeaking in Benin, acting governor of Edo State, Comrade Philip Shaibu, reiterated that the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, had clarified that only the Federal Government has the authority to grant licences for firearms, adding that the matter is on the Exclusive List of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said that Nigeria is not the United States where every state can legislate on firearms, adding that until the National Assembly tinkers with the law the matter remains on the Exclusive List.\n\nShaibu, while noting that insecurity across the country was worrisome, said that the nation cannot become a place where every individual is allowed to carry arms, which at the end of the day would be difficult to control.\n\nHowever, Bishop Dr Osadolor Ochei, immediate past interim chairman, Edo Civil Society Organizations (EDOCSO), countered the view of the state government, saying that the call by the Zamfara State governor that Nigerians should buy guns to defend themselves was a welcome development, adding that even in the Bible people were asked to sell their garments to buy swords, to defend themselves.\n\nOchei explained: \u201cWell, insecurity in the country has overwhelmed the Federal Government and government has failed monumentally and the only answer to the problem is individuals and citizens of this country taking up arms to defend themselves. Life is sacred and it is given to man by God that nobody should take another man\u2019s life except by judgment of a competent court.\n\n\u201cNow that impunity is the order of the day, and some tribes and certain persons have taken it upon themselves that the authority to kill belongs to them, it is my own personal opinion that Nigerians should rise up to defend themselves as the governor of Zamfara said the other day.\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes a man to defend himself, it is a right that cannot be denied. Number one, as a bishop and a Christian, Jesus told us to have a sword and if you don\u2019t have, sell your garment to buy one. You don\u2019t use sword to open the Bible, it is for a day like this that we have in Nigeria, that if there is confrontation, the first right is to defend yourself so that nobody else will kill you.\n\n\u201cNow, if certain persons say they have the monopoly to own a gun without license, and they can brandish it anywhere, kill, kidnap, destroy property and nobody in government challenges them, I am saying that Nigerians should go and look for gun and buy. If you can\u2019t afford it, go and buy cutlass, go and buy axe, go and buy whatever even if it is blade, to defend yourself. I am saying Nigerians are entitled to have it for self-defence. I want to see how the president will arrest about 100 million of us that have guns and put us in correctional centres.\n\nAgain gunmen invade, bomb Kogi poli... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Again gunmen invade, bomb Kogi police station, kill one officer\n\n\u201cThe house he is going to build to arrest and keep Nigerians because we bought guns to defend ourselves, he should go and start building it now because the ones that are doing it, he has not built any and none of those so-called bandits or Boko Haram or ISWAP have been arrested and prosecuted. If you arrest any of them today, they will send message from Abuja, transfer the person arrested to Abuja and that is the end of the story.\n\n\u201cSo, the government has responsibility for securing of our lives and property, instead of protecting our lives and property, government is the one sponsoring killing, maiming, kidnapping and raping in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAnother respondent, Bevy Efe, said that Nigerians must rise up to defend themselves, noting that nobody has monopoly of violence.\n\nJust like Bishop Ochei, a community leader in Birnin Gwari emirate, Kaduna State, Alhaji Zubairu Idris Abdulra\u2019uf, welcomed the directive by the Zamfara State governor to his people, disclosing that already the people of his emirate have adopted that option.\n\nAbdulrra\u2019uf lamented that the incessant attacks on his people had completely paralysed economic activities in their rural communities and made travelling in the area so difficult or even impossible in some places.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have reached the point of no return. People are being pushed to the wall. Just recently, Randegi is one of the areas where these bandits go through to get to Zamfara State and Niger State.\n\n\u201cThe people of Randegi confronted the bandits who tried to overrun the farming community, and they succeeded in dislodging the bandits. So, I think our people are now ready, if the government cannot perform its constitutional function. When people are frustrated, they will look for the best option for themselves, which is to arm themselves if the government cannot protect them.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a situation where people can no longer work or even travel one kilometre from Birnin Gwari town to other areas and it is the same thing that we have in all the districts in Birnin Gwari. If something is not done, we are going to have food crisis. Birnin-Gwari used to produce at least 700 metric tons of assorted grains, but now people cannot access their farms. There are many cases, since the beginning of this rainy season, of people being abducted on their way to the farm and even the cattle they used for farming are being taken from them.\u201d\n\nThough the Kaduna State government has kept mute over Matawalle\u2019s call, a group, the Concerned Northern Forum (CNF) urged the Zamfara governor to re-examine his position on the issue of residents bearing arms for self-defence.\n\nChairman of the group, Abdulsalam Kazeem, expressed worry that arms bearing by citizens may lead to more problems.\n\nGiving reasons for the position of the group, Kazeem said: \u201cWe are not against self-defence, but we can\u2019t support the decision directing civilians to bear arms themselves, because we are all witnesses to the inability of developed countries with accurate data at all levels with such policies and their inability to stop the consequences of gun violence.\n\n\u201cWe as a Forum and one of the leading voices of our region sympathise with the government and people of Zamfara State over the current spate of insecurity and the untold hardship the said situation caused them despite their loyalty to constituted authorities.\n\n\u201cAccording to Fire Arms Act, private citizens are only licenced to acquire pump action and shotguns, so how can a farmer in Zamfara State defend him self against terrorists with GPMG, anti-aircraft and AK 47? Who will train the farmers after acquiring such arms, what is the capacity of our training ranges nationwide and who will be responsible for the training? And at what point will Zamfara State government retrieve all the said guns licensed to them? These are too many questions begging for answers.\u201d\n\nThe group, therefore, appealed to the Federal Government to deploy more security personnel to Zamfara State, \u201cin order to empower local vigilante groups as we believe it will help in local intelligence gathering and our security agencies should be properly empowered, which in return will bring about efficiency, effectiveness and timely results that will stand the challenge of time.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Colonel Dan Amuta (Rtd), who runs a private security agency, agreed with the position of Kazeem\u2019s CNF, arguing that the acquisition of weapons must be centrally controlled or it would lead to lawlessness.\n\nHe said that the call by Matawale was a mistake as things must follow the right process.\n\nHis words: \u201cThere is what we call centralized control. Issues that have bearing with arms and ammunition, weaponry must be centrally controlled. You cannot call out individuals to be armed because it will result to lawlessness.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the Governor of Zamfara to me is simply a mistake. It is out of place to call for everybody to be armed. That is not possible. At the federal level, government will never accept it.\u201d\n\nAlso another security expert, Clement Nssien, differed as he told Sunday Sun that the issue was beyond tolerance as the people\u2019s patience had expired.\n\nHe said there was no government in Nigeria any longer and the truth is for the people to defend themselves if they must be alive.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that we have no government in Nigeria any longer given what we are witnessing and the people must take their fate in their hands. Some people are talking legally and quoting the constitution while the people are dying. They argue that Matawale has no right for such action and I ask: is it when his citizens are all dead that the Federal Government will sit-up to its responsibility? The call for self-defence is inevitable now.\n\n\u201cI hear the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor saying that the AGF should tell Nigerians if Bello Matawale has the powers to give such order. Is it when all Nigerians are dead that the army, police and other security agencies Irabor is talking about will wake up to their job? I can tell you for free that this directive will be a precursor of what will happen in other parts of the country soon. The people are left with no other alternative, but to resort to self-help, nobody depends on the security forces/agencies any longer.\u201d\n\nIn his view, the Director General of the Institute of Security, Nigeria, ISN, at the University of Lagos, Adebayo Akinade, a lawyer, said that Matawale gave the order as a result of frustration at the moment.\n\n\u201cIf the Federal Government has failed to provide security for the citizenry, any other means is okay. So, the governor obviously gave the order in frustration. If the Federal Government had provided adequate security, there would be no need for Governor Matawalle\u2019s order. The order was the only option open to the governor in the circumstance he found himself. This is not the time to be talking about law because we are already in a bad and lawless situation. The Federal Government should be up and doing.\u201d\n\nWhile also reacting to the issue, Mrs Cynthia Nkemdi, a security consultant told Sunday Sun that what Matawale proposed was no longer new as most Nigerians are already obtaining arms legally and illegally for self-defense.\n\n\u201cI align myself to the position of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on this issue. The inability of the government to provide security had made the people conscious of the need for self-defence and to develop their private security plans. Even if Matawale did not say it, individuals are now obtaining guns themselves against the attacks of terrorists and bandits. The precarious security situation has left many with no choice than to acquire guns for self-protection and they are not making noise about it.\u201d\n\nIn Niger State, All Progressive Congress (APC) chieftain and former Commissioner for Information, Culture and Touris, Mr Jonathan Vatsa, threw his weight behind Matawalle, saying that the need for people to arm themselves for self-defence is long overdue.\n\nThe former state publicity secretary of the ruling party said that the security agents have failed in their primary responsibility, which is to protect the people as evidenced in the daily massacre of innocent Nigerians, especially in the northern parts of the country.\n\nVatsa said that the governor must have spoken out of frustration over the daily massacre of his people, stressing that no responsible government could watch the people being killed with reckless abandon, adding that the number of innocent Nigerians that have been killed by terrorists in the country since 2015 to date is more than the number of Nigerians that die in civil casualties.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the government has failed in its primary responsibility to the citizen. There is no security anywhere in the country, people are being killed without help from anywhere and you said they should not defend themselves. People are not safe on the road, in their houses or in their farms.\n\n\u201cNobody needs to tell you that you need to protect yourself. The governor does not need to announce it, it is high time for Nigerians to defend themselves against these agents of darkness taking over everywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cThese terrorists have practically changed the lifestyle of Nigerians. Children are not safe in the boarding schools, farmers can\u2019t go to their farms. People are being abducted without any attempt to rescue them by the government that is saying you cannot defend yourself.\n\n\u201cThe victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attacks are still with the terrorists in the bush for over three months now and many more others as if there is no government in the country. What exactly does the government want Nigerians to do, to fold their hands and allow themselves to be killed like animals?\n\n\u201cIf the government is against people defending themselves against these criminals then there is an agenda behind the whole insecurity in the country because the government cannot say it doesn\u2019t have solution to all these madness.\u201d\n\nVatsa cited the attack at the Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State as a clear example of why Nigerians should defend themselves, stressing: \u201cIf the terrorists knew that the worshippers were carrying guns in the church, they wouldn\u2019t have carried out the attack because it would have been fire for fire.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the orgy of killings by terrorists tagged bandits, Delta State government has expressed its commitment to ensure the security and safety of residents in the state.\n\nDespite pockets of attacks in parts of the state, the government assured that the situation would not be allowed to escalate to the level where residents would resort to self-help to protect themselves against criminal elements.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Sun in Asaba, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, Olisa Ifeajika, said that his boss would not even contemplate giving such advice to residents in Delta State, insisting that it was not constitutional.\n\nIfeajika stated that security situation in Delta would not be allowed to deteriorate to the level where those saddled with the responsibility of protecting lives would be overwhelmed and get frustrated with the system.\n\nHe said that the outcry by the Zamfara governor resulted from frustration, seeing that his efforts at addressing security challenges in that state were not yielding the desired results.\n\nIfeajika noted that the security situation was peculiar to Zamfara to have warranted such advice from the state chief executive.\n\nAccording to him, people have been talking about citizens bearing arms as insecurity keeps worsening in parts of the country, adding that the Zamfara governor only added his voice to it in desperate bid to draw focused attention of concerned authorities to the situation and save lives in that state.\n\nIfeajika stated that the advice also reinforced the call for state police so that state governments would be able to squarely deal with peculiar security threats in their areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Ebonyi State, Aliyu Garba, has affirmed that the Command would not support any directive to issue gun licences to citizens of the state for the purpose of self-defense.\n\nHe explained that despite the increasing level of insecurity that it would be counter-productive to give guns to citizens indiscriminately. He argued that such self-defense mechanism should not be contemplated not only in Ebonyi State, but in the entire country given the temperaments of many of the citizens.\n\nGarba opined that people of the state would be killing themselves daily if they were allowed to carry guns around.\n\nHe explained that the idea of gun licensing is not good for the Nigerian environment given the level of distrust, anger and bitterness in the country.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have not received such directive from the Ebonyi State government. It is not even a good idea because Ebonyi people will be killing themselves on daily basis if they are given guns for self-defense. People that are looking for something and they hadn\u2019t seen it. Now, the thing is at their beck and call? They will be killing themselves. Everyday, they are carrying cutlasses and killing themselves at any slightest provocation. What would happen when they are allowed to carry guns? Even the Americans are coming up with measures to stop their citizens from carrying guns and we are here talking about allowing people carry guns. You are giving African man gun for self-defense? I\u2019m telling you, just mere provocation, he would enter the room, carry it and fire.\u201d\n\nUpcountry in Taraba State, Governor Darius Ishaku differed from the Matawalle\u2019s position.\n\nHe said that rather than asking citizens to acquire weapons to defend themselves against terrorists, the Federal Government should support the various state governments to empower their local security establishments to tackle the menace more holistically.\n\nThe governor who spoke through his media aide, Mr Bala Dan Abu, recalled that the former Minister of Defense, General Theophilus Danjuma (rtd) had made the call earlier for the people to rise up and defend themselves since the security agencies had failed in their responsibility to protect lives and property of the people.\n\nHe, however, noted that security is too delicate to be left in the hands of the people and described the calls for citizens to arm themselves as desperate last resort as a result of how frustrating it could be for a leader to watch his people die needlessly.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we would rather insist that the Federal Government should support the various states to enable them empower their various security establishments to tackle the menace of terrorism.\n\n\u201cIn Taraba State, we have the Taraba Marshalls that was set up by the state government for this purpose. Unfortunately, the Federal Government spent a lot of time doing everything to frustrate the smooth take off of the security outfit. It is only now that we are putting it together to commence operation fully, but there is still the issue of funding.\n\n\u201cSo, I will rather ask the Federal Government to empower and support the states to arm their local security establishments to address their peculiar security challenges. The thing is that, even if you ask the people to arm themselves, how many people can actually afford to acquire the sophisticated weapons that these terrorists use to match their firepower,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, former military administrator of Delta State, Air Commodore Luke Ochulor (rtd), said that the call by Zamfara State governor on its citizens to take up arms and defend themselves would worsen the situation and breed anarchy.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou can\u2019t solve a problem with a problem, even the military wants to reduce the license of those who are having it. That\u2019s not the way to solve the problem, best way to solve the problem in Zamfara is to give a leeway to the military and encourage them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the traditional Prime Minster of Ndegwu community in Owerri West Local Government Area of Imo State who also doubles as the Chairman of Association of Imo State Indigenous Town Unions, Samson Ogbos, corroborated Ochulor\u2019s views.\n\nHe said: \u201cAllowing people over here to carry arms will degenerate to a state of lawlessness. It would be bastardised such that at the slightest provocation you will see a neighbour shooting his fellow neighbour; even some family members will shoot one another.\u201d\n\nIn Abia State, the position of government officials and opinion leaders leaders are that liberalizing the carrying of arms would not in any way curb insecurity in the state, arguing that it would rather escalate it.\n\nTheir belief was that liberalizing the possession of arms could make such weapons end up in wrong hands, and then used by such individuals to unleash mayhem on the society and the people would be worse for it.\n\nThough Abia State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Eze Chikamnanyo, could not be reached to speak on the government\u2019s position, a senior official of the Ministry told Sunday Sun that only the state governor could speak on the issue, given its sensitive nature.\n\nHe, however, suggested that the state government could strengthen her security outfits, including the Bakassi Boys, Homeland Security and Ebubeagu.\n\nUde Okoro, an official of the Landlord\u2019s Association in Abia did not think along the line of arming residents as a way of curbing insecurity in the state.\n\n\u201cAdvocating the arming of residents as a means of checkmating insecurity in the state, will not in any way be the panacea for curbing insecurity in Abia.\n\n\u201cLook at what happened during electioneering period in the past, when some politicians armed thugs to help them win election and after the elections, the thugs ended up using the said guns to terrorize the citizens.\n\n\u201cSo, if that was the case, then come to think of when everybody is allowed to have a gun, hell will be let loose, there will be anarchy everywhere\u201d, Okoro said.\n\nA community leader, Ibe Onyeaku, equally agreed with Okoro\u2019s view of liberalising arms should not be allowed, saying, \u201cNigeria has not got to the level where the advanced climes are operating, and joining them to liberalize carrying of arms, will spell doom for the state and the country.\u201d",

          "title": "Why Kwankwaso/Obi alliance talk is stalled \u2013Senator Rufai Hanga",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen\n\nSenator Rufai Hanga is one of the leading members of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Kano State. In this interview, he gave an insight into what may likely be the outcome of the 2023 presidential poll, postulating the possibility of a rerun.\n\nThe 2023 presidential contest is getting increasingly exciting by the day. Would you say that the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) genuinely represents the Third Force people have been yearning for?\n\nThat is the Third Force people have been expecting. You know I spoke about it a long time ago before that a Third Force might come and that when it comes it will be a miracle. To me, it is already a miracle. It is not a newly registered party, it was registered about 20 years ago and nobody ever heard about it. But the moment we adopted it in less than two months, it has spread to nooks and crannies of the country and it is still spreading and growing. We have so many things that assured us of winning the coming presidential election.\n\nHow would you then account for its acceptance in such a speedy manner?\n\nIt is because people are tired of APC and PDP. There is nothing you can tell responsible, well-meaning Nigerians who care about the situation in the country-insecurity, poverty, unemployment, collapse of education, economic downturn and so many other things \u2013 about APC and PDP that they will listen to you. People discarded the PDP because of its abysmal performance and embraced APC. Now, the APC has even performed worse than PDP. So, it is difficult to trust any of the two parties anymore. In the midst of this situation, definitely, people will want to experiment, especially knowing that the people who formed the NNPP are people of impeccable character. That is the reason people embraced it.\n\nIf NNPP has been registered over 20 years ago as you said, why has it remained underground?\n\nFulani group picks APC nomination f... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Fulani group picks APC nomination forms for Jonathan\n\nIt has been there for a long time like Accord Party and so many others. You know that some parties that had no appreciable showing had been deregistered by the INEC, but NNPP remained afloat because it managed to win a seat in Bauchi. Somebody won a seat in the Bauchi State House of Assembly on the platform of the NNPP and that is why it remains afloat. There are some other parties too that have some pockets of seats here and there, but they are not as popular as NNPP.\n\nWho were the brains behind its formation?\n\nThe brain behind it is one Chief from Anambra, Dr Boniface Okechukwu. He was the person who registered it. He is not a full-time politician; he is a businessman in Lagos. He came and handed over the party to us with Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as the National Leader and the presidential candidate, while he (Dr Okechukwu) is now the Chairman, Board of Trustees (BOT) of the party.\n\nHow would you convince the electorate that NNPP represents a clean break from the past since most of the leading members like you had one time or the other dined and wined with the two leading parties?\n\nThe difference is that most of the people that formed NNPP are the people that have been ostracised by the APC and PDP because they are not comfortable with the ideologies of the two parties. They have had disagreement with them on so many issues and so they had to part with them and form another party. Besides these people, we also have other like-minds, who have not been in politics before, but are now coming into the fold. There are lots of professors in the universities, some civil servants and businessmen who have been watching the happenings in the country. We encouraged them to come into politics and a lot of them have answered the call and they are coming to embrace the party. Most of them are fresh politicians who are coming together to salvage the situation and rescue the nation. So, it is not going to be business as usual.\n\nThere is a lot of rhetoric here. In specific terms, what are you going to do differently if you are given the opportunity to lead the country?\n\nWe are bringing on board integrity, we are bringing on board openness, level playing field, equal opportunity, fairness, equity and justice. That is why we adopted New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). We want a new Nigeria where people are equal, where there is fairness, where there is equity, where people will have a say in what affects them.\n\nYou mentioned integrity. But in governance, integrity is like a promissory note. You recall that President Muhammadu Buhari came on board in 2015 on the crest of integrity. With the current situation of things, do you think anybody can sway the voters with rhetoric of integrity?\n\nPeople embraced Buhari because they thought he can do it. But we are bringing on board people who have already done it and we are sure they will do it again. That is the difference. Even when Buhari had the opportunity to do it, he was not the main player; he was just a figure head. He was not the actual actor. People in NNPP are the actual actors and that is why we are sure we are bringing integrity because these are people with proven competence.\n\nCan you now boast that the party will have a stronghold in the Southeast since the founder is a man from Anambra as you have earlier mentioned?\n\nTo say the truth, the stronghold of the party is not in the Southeast. But it has its roots there and a good followership. The stronghold of the party now is mostly in the North. In the whole of the North, I don\u2019t think there is any state where we don\u2019t have a sizeable followership. I assure you; the party will either come first or second in the whole of the North. In Southern part, there are also states where we will come either first or second. I don\u2019t want to be too ambitious by saying we will come first everywhere in the South. But in the North, I think we will come first in most of the states.\n\nOne would have expected you to seize the opportunity of this auspicious moment to formalize a solid alliance with the Southeast using your fresh idea about a new Nigeria that is evolving as a vehicle. Why isn\u2019t it so?\n\nWe are talking with Peter Obi, but the talk is stalled by some little disagreement on who should be the presidential candidate and the running mate. Otherwise, it would have been consummated. We have issues, but not too serious. I hope we will later on agree. Peter Obi people want him to be the presidential candidate, and we want Kwankwaso to be the presidential candidate. Somebody who brings more food on the table is supposed to be the candidate. On our part, we think Kwankwaso will bring more food on the table because going by qualification and experience, Kwankwaso is more experienced. Peter Obi too is qualified educationally, but Kwankwaso is an Engineer and a PhD holder, who has worked in several capacities as a two-term governor in Kano State, as deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, as a member of constitutional conference, as an ambassador, as a minister of defence, and as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. In all of these positions, he has performed tremendously well. He succeeded in a lot of assignments he was given as an ambassador. In the constitutional conference, he interacted with a lot of Nigerians from all walks of life and he knows the pulse of the nation. The Senate is also a platform for all Nigerians. Peter Obi is not all that experienced when it comes to governance and he is even a lot younger than Kwankwao. That is why we say Peter Obi should be the running mate for sometimes to learn more under Kwankwaso and then takeover after Kwankwaso must have finished his terms. But simply because of sentiment about power shift, they don\u2019t want to agree. Peter Obi has just joined the Labour Party; he doesn\u2019t have the structure in the party. I don\u2019t think there is a state in the North where Labour Party has a gubernatorial candidate, where they have local government chairmen, where they have members of state and National Assembly. But we have them all over the place in the country. So, how can he come and ask Kwankwaso to come and be his running mate simply because of the sentiment about power shift to the Southeast? It is wrong, it is unfair, it is unjust. If only Peter Obi and his people will agree with us, we can go along together and have an alliance. But if they don\u2019t, there are many other people who are coming forward to be the running mate. We will choose a credible candidate among them. Certainly, Peter Obi is a man of integrity, very intelligent, sound in economy and business. He will be of help in the position of Vice President because he will be the chairman of Economic Council. If he can come down to be running mate, it will be fine. In a matter of days, you will hear from us because we have not finalized our discussion. We have a lot of credible people on the queue to take it.\n\nIt is also in the news that APC has approached your party for an alliance. How far have you gone on that too?\n\nWe are not engaged in any merger talk with either APC or PDP, but they have both approached us. They want our co-operation; they want us to go together. How is that possible? Let me give you an example, we have candidates for all positions in Kano, Jigawa, Katsina. But PDP does not have candidates for all positions in Kano; it does not have candidates for all positions in Jigawa and Katsina states because people are not interested in the tickets. They know they won\u2019t win. Even in Kano, people know they will waste their money if they pick the tickets of the PDP. Despite the propaganda that they are going to win the election, people didn\u2019t buy their forms. How do you expect us to go along with PDP when they don\u2019t have candidates? We can lay claim to the whole of the North and some pockets of states in the South. Even in the Southwest, we have a very strong support in Oyo and Ogun states. We have strong support in Delta, Akwa Ibom states and some other states in the South-south. None of these three parties can alone secure 2/3 majority votes. There will be a rerun. And that is where alliance will come into play to secure a simple majority required by the constitution. This is what we are counting on. The question of APC winning does not arise. It won\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t see APC winning anywhere in the North other than Borno and Yobe where they will write the votes.\n\nAre you saying that you still don\u2019t have confidence in the INEC despite the perceived improvement in its performance in the recent elections in Ekiti and Anambra states?\n\nThey don\u2019t do election in Borno and Yobe, they only write results there. The performance of INEC is improving, but there is nothing they can do in Borno and Yobe. There was Boko Haram in Borno and Yobe when we had the previous elections. More than 12 local governments were in the hands of Boko Haram. Yet, they produced impossible results in Borno. Where did they get the results? Who came out to vote? How would they have voted when people were there in IDP camps and Cameroun? So, they must have written the results.\n\nWith electronic transmission of results, do you think that is still possible?\n\nLet\u2019s wait and see.",

None of those facts alleged had any close relationship to the truth. The person behind these allegations is Daniel Igbokwe, who wants to reap where he did not sow. I am known as a big rice farmer in Ebonyi; so, how can they claim that I have no farm to train the beneficiaries. Please, disregard the petition, it is a fabrication.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "The Abia State chapter of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has said the Founding National Chairman of the party, Chief Chekwas Okorie, is no longer a member of the party.\n\nAPGA Chairman, Rev. Augustine Ehiemere made this known to journalists yesterday in Umuahia, while clarifying who the authentic national leadership of the party was.\n\nAccording to the state Chairman, Okorie \u201cwas expelled in 2003 for anti-party activities and embezzlement of party funds. And a few years after his expulsion, he floated the United Peoples Grand Alliance in 2012.\u201d\n\nEhiemere further noted Okorie later joined the All Progressives Congress, but did not last long in the party.\n\nThe APGA chieftain said that it was preposterous for Okorie to turn around to claim to be the party\u2019s Presidential flag bearer.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor record purposes, Chekwas Okorie is not a member of APGA let alone being its presidential candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has lost his political value and credibility as far as Nigerian politics is concerned.\n\n\u201cAll his efforts now is to see how he can eke a living by joining Chief Edozie Njoku to parade themselves as the National Chairman and Presidential Candidate of APGA, respectively.\n\n\u201cThey are both aware that their claims are false and fraudulent.\u201d\n\nEhiemere described Okorie and Njoku as \u201cpolitical impostors, who want to reap where they have not sown\u201d.\n\nHe said Chief Ike Oye and Prof. Peter Umeadi remained the authentic National Chairman and Presidential Candidate of the party, respectively.\n\n\u201cAPGA has only one presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, Prof. Peter Umeadi, who emerged from a special national convention of the party held in Abuja in June,\u201d he said.\n\nEhiemere said the name of Okorie, who hailed from Alayi in Bende Local Government Area of Abia, \u201cis not in the APGA\u2019s ward register\u201d.\n\nHe, therefore, warned the public to beware of Okorie and Njoku, alleging that they were being used by the enemies of APGA to cause confusion and distract Oye.\n\nHe expressed the party\u2019s unalloyed loyalty to Oye\u2019s chairmanship. He said his leadership had raised APGA\u2019s political profile, making it the first and only political party in the country to own a National Secretariat in Abuja.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Abia APGA passes a vote of confidence on the National Working Committee of our great party, led by Chief Victor Oye.\n\n\u201cThis is to appreciate the committee for its resilience, doggedness and astuteness in piloting the affairs of the party, which we hope to bring victory to us in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ehiemere and the party\u2019s Legal Adviser, Mr. Chukwuemeka Nwokoro, have described the alleged Supreme Court decision, declaring Njoku as the National Chairman of the party, as \u201cnon-existent\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo such Supreme Court decision exists anywhere.There is no such judgment by the apex court.\n\n\u201cIt all emanated from their fraudulent intentions to cause confusion in the party,\u201d Nwokoro said.\n\nHe challenged Njoku to institute a contempt suit against APGA, Oye and INEC, if he was sure of any such Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWhen the decision of a court is flouted or disobeyed, the option left to the litigant is to institute a case of contempt of court,\u201d Nwokoro said.",

          "text": "*Electoral umpire recognises Akpabio-backed APC faction in Akwa Ibom*Vote-buying may mar Osun governorship poll, say INEC, NSA\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nAs presidential candidates and other politicians seeking elective offices in the 2023 general election continue to claim that their certificates are missing, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disclosed that 216 requests have so far been received demanding the particulars of some of the candidates.\n\n\n\nThe electoral umpire and the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen Babagana Monguno (rtd) have also raised the alarm on the potential dangers of vote-buying in the forthcoming July 16 Osun State governorship election.\n\n\n\nAlso barring any last-minute changes, the name of the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio will be on the ballot as the senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Akwa Ibom North-West in next year\u2019s general election.\n\n\n\nThis is a sequel to the recognition of the Akpabio-backed Stephen Ntukepko-led leadership of the APC in Akwa Ibom State by INEC.\n\nAt a meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) held yesterday in Abuja to review security arrangements for the Osun State governorship election, the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated that the number of requests by Nigerians seeking a Certified True Copy (CTC) of the particulars of the candidates has risen to 216.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore I conclude, let me seize this opportunity to once again reassure all Nigerians who applied for Certified True Copies (CTCs) of documents arising from the recent party congresses, primaries and nomination of candidates that all requests are being attended to expeditiously despite the huge quantities of documents involved.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigerian election, especially the conduct of primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, is one of the most litigated in the world. As of yesterday evening (Friday, July 1, 2022), 216 requests have so far been processed involving the certification of over 1,650,000) pages of documents.\n\n\u201cIndeed, there are now far more cases challenging the breach of internal democracy within political parties than those involving the conduct of the main elections by INEC. We will continue to work round the clock, including the weekends, to ensure that we attend to all applications received at the headquarters of the commission promptly,\u201d Yakubu explained.\n\n\n\nAccording to the documents submitted to INEC, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in an affidavit submitted to INEC, claimed that he changed his name from Siddiq Abubakar as it appears on his West African School Certificate (WASC), to Atiku Abubakar.\n\nWhile Atiku was silent on the primary school he attended, he disclosed his General Certificate Education (GCE) results obtained in 1965 and a Higher Certificate (Master\u2019s degree) obtained in 2021.\n\n\n\nAlso, the presidential flagbearer of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Sani Yabagi, in an affidavit he submitted to INEC, said that the name on his degree and WASC is different from what he currently bears.\n\nIn the same manner, the Delta State governor and vice presidential candidate of the PDP, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa in an affidavit attached to his particulars, informed INEC that his WASC obtained in 1974 was missing.\n\n\n\nOkowa, however, attached a Higher School Certificate obtained in 1976.\n\nThe presidential candidate of the Young People\u2019s Party (YPP), Prince Abdul Malik Ado Ibrahim, in the affidavit sworn to at the Federal High Court of Justice, Maitama, Abuja, on June 3, 2022, claimed that his original BSc degree issued by American College of Los Angeles, dated 1988; High School Diploma issued to him by Langley High, Norwich, UK dated 1979 and official degree transcript was missing.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY had earlier reported that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu was silent on the primary and secondary schools he attended.\n\nMeanwhile, with less than two weeks to the governorship election in Osun State on July 16, Yakubu also raised concern over the dangers of vote-buying in the governorship election\n\n\n\n\u201cAgain, arising from the experience in recent elections, vote-buying remains a major area of concern.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the role played by the anti-corruption and security agencies in apprehending some of the perpetrators of this brazen assault on our democracy.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we are working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to ensure the prosecution of persons arrested in the recent Ekiti governorship election. Action will commence as soon as the EFCC completes its investigation. I appeal to all security agencies to continue to join hands with the Commission to tackle this menace.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe INEC chairman commended the relationship between INEC and security agencies in the Ekiti State governorship election.\n\nHe announced the readiness of INEC for the Osun State election, saying, \u201con our part, all the major activities that are supposed to be carried out at this stage have been successfully undertaken.\u201d\n\n\n\nYakubu added that the commission would keep a close watch on the security situation in Osun State.\n\nAlso, the NSA, Monguno has raised the alarm that the July 16 Osun State governorship election may be hijacked or sabotaged by politicians through buying of voters.\n\n\n\nMonguno who was represented by Sanusi Galadima from his office said: \u201cThe NSA also urged ICCES members to build on the successes recorded from the Ekiti election as some disgruntled politicians may attempt to sabotage the process for their selfish gains, through vote-buying and other forms of voter inducement as well as political thuggery.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also commended the INEC for the extension of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise.\n\nThe NSA said that records from the conduct of the last Ekiti State governorship election indicated an impressive performance by the INEC as well as the security agencies as there were no major incidents of security concern recorded during and after the election.\n\nElectoral Umpire Recognises Akpabio-backed APC Faction in Akwa Ibom\n\nMeanwhile, barring any last-minute changes, the name of the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Akpabio will be ballot as the senatorial candidate of the APC for the Akwa Ibom North-West election next year.\n\n\n\nThis is the sequel to the recognition of the Ntukepko-led leadership of the party in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in Akwa Ibom State, Mr Mike Igini, had stated that the APC cannot field any candidate in next year\u2019s general election following its alleged inability to conduct a valid primary election for the selection of its candidates in the state and national elections.\n\n\n\nAkpabio had participated in the APC\u2019s presidential primary and did not feature in any senatorial primary of the APC.\n\nHis name was however forwarded by the APC to INEC as its senatorial candidate in the February 2023 senatorial election, after he was said to have participated in a senatorial primary conducted by the Ntukepko-led faction, which the electoral body did not recognise.\n\n\n\nBut in a letter dated June 21, 2022, and signed by the Secretary to INEC, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony, the electoral umpire informed its REC in Akwa Ibom State that it would abide by a court judgment which declared Ntukepko as the authentic Chairman of the state chapter of the APC.\n\n\n\nThe letter marked: Ref: INEC/L&P/FHC/22/339/84, a copy of which was sighted by THISDAY reads, \u201cThis is to formally draw your attention to the subsisting Judgment/Order of the Federal High Court, Abuja (Suit No: FCH/ABJ/CS/1635/2021) which recognised Hon, Stephen Leo Ntukekpo as the Chairman of the APC in Awka Ibom State;\n\n\n\n\u201cThe commission is to comply with the content of the judgment, please.\u201d\n\nWhile Igini had claimed that the APC in Akwa Ibom State did not conduct any primary monitored by INEC in the state, the APC had claimed that it re-conducted its primary at a rescheduled date wherein it informed the commission.\n\nIn a letter dated June 15 and cited by THISDAY, the APC accordingly urged the commission to recognise its candidates in the forthcoming general elections in the state.\n\n\n\nThe letter signed by APC\u2019s National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore read in part, \u201cFollowing the judgment delivered in the above-mentioned suit which declared the Stephen Leo Ntukekpo-led state executive as the duly and democratically-elected members of the Akwa \u2013 Ibom State Executive Committee, our party which has always been law-abiding, elected to obey the court\u2019s judgment and swear \u2013 in Stephen Leo Ntukekpo as the State Chairman of the party in Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cOur party recently conducted its primary election to nominate the governorship candidate in Akwa Ibom State, wherein Mr. Akan Udofia emerged victorious as the candidate of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the news making the rounds both in print and electronic media is that the Resident Electoral Commissioner in Akwa Ibom State, Mr Mike Igini has been quoted as saying that our Party does not have a Governorship candidate in Akwa Ibom as no primary election took place to nominate our candidate.\n\n\u201cWe respectfully request that Mr Mike Igini should be called to order and refrain from making statements that are likely to cause political turmoil in Akwa Ibom State and put our party and your commission in a bad light.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr Chairman you are aware that political parties have exclusive rights to nominating candidates. We would therefore insist on exercising those rights.\n\n\u201cWe equally request that all rights and privileges should be accorded to the Stephen Leo Ntukekpo-led State Executive Committee in Akwa Ibom State as we do not recognise any other group or faction particularly as there is a court judgment validating the State Executives led by Stephen Leo Ntukekpo.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that you will give the concerns we have raised the much-needed attention they deserve in order not to bring your commission into disrepute and unnecessary embarrassment\u201d.\n\n\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo had in a judgment delivered on March 17, declared Ntukepko as the authentic Chairman of the APC in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nAn appeal filed against the judgment at the court of Appeal was also dismissed following its withdrawal by the APC.",

          "text": "Troops of the Nigerian military comprising the Navy and the Army have reportedly killed dozens of innocent citizens in the productive age bracket in Ogbaru communities of Anambra State.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that the wanton killings, it was gathered took place on Tuesday night, 28th and early hours of Wednesday, 29th June 2022 at Ossomala, Umunankwo and Obeagwa communities.\n\nThe deployment of the military personnel in the area had begun in the evening of Tuesday during which they claimed to be looking for unknown gunmen that recently laid the area under siege, according to sources.\n\nThe soldiers, according to information SaharaReporters obtained,later turned their guns on the defenceless and unarmed natives and others, while abandoning the forests where the locals said were the hideouts of the unknown gunmen located inside big river/swamp forest of Obene-Ochuche/Umuzu/Okija divided by Ulasi River.\n\nThe soldiers were said to have been mobilised from Ogbaru Naval Base and Onitsha 302 Artillery Regiment in over 20 trucks with arms and ammunition.

The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\n'Missing' Arms Funds\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nBuratai's History Of Graft\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

          "text": "It is two hours past noon and Samson had \u2018restless\u2019 written on his face. He was visibly upset too. As he paced about the vicinity of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in Ikeja, in search of a pen, beads of sweat rolled down his dark skin.\n\nSamson had come to find a solution to a problem that was about to crash his business and strain his relationships. But at that moment, the major obstacle in his way was the lack of a pen required to fill a form.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make calls,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really affecting me because I can\u2019t reach my people in case anything happens.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, the federal government launched the NIN-SIM linkage policy, which mandates subscribers to link their SIM cards with their national identity numbers, (NIN). The government had said the benefits include improving national security and reducing identity fraud and other online crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the multiple extension of deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage, implementation commenced on April 4, 2022 \u2014 and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) directed all telcos to bar outgoing calls on unlinked lines.\n\nAs expected, the impact was immediate as millions of Nigerians were blocked from making phone calls and sending text messages \u2014 including Samson.\n\nREGISTERED, LINKED BUT BARRED\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he had earlier linked his NIN with his Globacom and MTN lines but he recently discovered that the linking process failed for the former.\n\n\u201cI was using an MTN line and I linked the line with the NIN before my phone got stolen. Since then, I\u2019ve been using Glo, and it is Glo that has been blocked. I had gotten my NIN and I just discovered that it has not been linked,\u201d the 37-year-old marketer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting both business and my relationship with people, especially family. I\u2019m into marketing and I can\u2019t call my customers.\u201d\n\nSamuel Wisdom, another subscriber, told TheCable that he got his NIN last year and complied with the government\u2019s directive on NIN-SIM linkage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, according to him, his line was blocked on April 7, three days after the policy implementation started.\n\nWisdom said his network provider, Airtel, said his NIN was not verified and he was then directed to NIMC\u2019s office for a solution.\n\n\u201cI went there and they said it was not registered and that I\u2019d have to fill another form to register again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy with the situation. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m just blocked out. You can\u2019t call anyone \u2014 even if you\u2019re in a difficult place where you need help \u2014 and this is bad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNarrating his experience, Tobi Tobe, said three days before the government decided to implement the policy, he tried to link his line via MTN\u2019s USSD code, but discovered it had not been verified by NIMC.\n\nTobe said he had got the NIN since last year and was hoping that linking would be a smooth ride. It was not the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA media practitioner, Jerry Agada, said he lost around N1 million from being barred despite linking.\n\n\u201cI linked,\u201d Agada retorted when asked why he did not. \u201cThat was the prerequisite for buying the sim at the Glo office. You can imagine my shock when I discovered my line was barred.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Abiola Akindele, a fashion designer, complained about losing her clients, while Adanna Lemchi expressed fears about the negative impact the issue is having on her startup.\n\nDuring conversations with affected persons and agents, TheCable learnt that \u2018unverified NIN\u2019 is the most common problem confronting subscribers.\n\nFor instance, Asuquo Etukudo, who took to social media to vent about the situation, said he received his NIN in 2014, but when he tried to link it with his Airtel line, he was told that the number failed NIMC\u2019s verification.\n\nHence, the line was barred.\n\nThe first pix shows my NIN, I obtained in 2014. The second shows message from Airtel that the number couldn't be verified from your office. Therefore my line was barred. What's going on, please. pic.twitter.com/NWqspVIuao \u2014 Asuquo Etukudo (@akpama_mi) May 12, 2022\n\n\u201cI used that same number to link MTN, and to date, I don\u2019t have any issues with that network provider,\u201d Etukudo TheCable.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE LINE/ BANK-GENERATED NIN\n\nSome subscribers, who were barred from making calls after failed attempts to link their lines, said they found that their lines were either \u2018corporate lines\u2019 or the NIN was bank-generated.\n\nFor instance, a user of a six-year-old Globacom line said the company told her that the line was a \u2018corporate line\u2019 after it was barred.\n\n\u201cWhen they were saying \u2018link your NIN\u2019, I linked my Glo only for them to still block my line,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI went to Glo\u2019s office and they told me that my line is a corporate line, which I don\u2019t understand. They checked my record and saw that I had registered the line in my name. How did a line I registered in my own name become a corporate line?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a radio broadcaster, who spoke anonymously, said he learnt that his NIN was bank-generated.\n\nAsked why he did not comply with the government\u2019s policy, he said: \u201cI linked it, but it was not successful because of the bank-generated issue. It has affected my business in so many ways.\u201d\n\nTELCOS FEELING THE HIT\n\nPrior to the policy\u2019s implementation, the telecommunication sector had been staggering since 2020. The sector posted sluggish growth in 2021 largely due to the various policy decisions taken by the government.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed a decline in internet users by 7.99 percent to 141.9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 against 150.8 million in January 2021.\n\nBy implication, mobile telecom operators lost about nine million data subscribers in 2021.\n\nTheCable had reported that MTN lost about 5.1 million subscribers, dropping from 63.9 million to 58.8 million between January and December 2021. Also, Airtel Nigeria lost 2.5 million subscribers between January and December 2021, while 9mobile lost 1.13 million subscribers within the same period.\n\nGlobacom, on the other hand, lost about 470,000 subscribers within the same period, according to data on NCC\u2019s website.\n\nAjibola Olude, executive secretary, Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), said the directive, which affected about 70 million subscribers, signals a loss of revenue for telcos.\n\n\u201cOur members were not happy because at the end of the day, [it] is going to have a negative effect on their profitability which may translate to not meeting their projected revenue for the year,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the NIMC needs to scale up its capabilities, especially in the \u201carea of storage\u201d, so that the issues being reported can be addressed.\n\n\u2018UNFAIR BALANCE OF POWER\u2019\n\nBoye Adegoke, senior programme manager, Paradigm Initiative (PIN), described the restriction on outgoing calls from unlinked lines as an unfair expression of balance of power.\n\nHe said it is a question of whether having NIN should be a prerequisite for being able to own a SIM card in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government has not done enough in terms of providing the requisite regulatory framework to guide the collection, or issuance of NIN.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a data protection law. Government is not keeping to its side of the bargain but it is using state power to coerce people into keeping to their own side of the bargain,\u201d Adegoke said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfair expression of balance of power. While citizens are left with little or no options in terms of getting the government to do what it is supposed to do in regards to making sure that there\u2019s a law around data protection in Nigeria, it is compelling citizens to [do] whatever it wants citizens to do and going to the extent of using punitive enforcement to achieve that by barring calls of those who have not registered.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s even worse when you now consider the fact that there\u2019re people who want to register but have not been able to due to no fault of theirs.\n\n\u201cSometimes logistical challenge on the part of NIMC, sometimes infrastructural issues, sometimes due to the nature of their work, and that\u2019s what makes it even more shameful.\u201d\n\nAdegoke added that NIN should not be the precondition for accessing basic and essential services.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, Kayode Adegoke, head of corporate communications, NIMC, did not respond to requests for comments on the issues raised.",

          "text": "It is two hours past noon and Samson had \u2018restless\u2019 written on his face. He was visibly upset too. As he paced about the vicinity of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in Ikeja, in search of a pen, beads of sweat rolled down his dark skin.\n\nSamson had come to find a solution to a problem that was about to crash his business and strain his relationships. But at that moment, the major obstacle in his way was the lack of a pen required to fill a form.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make calls,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really affecting me because I can\u2019t reach my people in case anything happens.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, the federal government launched the NIN-SIM linkage policy, which mandates subscribers to link their SIM cards with their national identity numbers, (NIN). The government had said the benefits include improving national security and reducing identity fraud and other online crimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the multiple extension of deadlines for the NIN-SIM linkage, implementation commenced on April 4, 2022 \u2014 and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) directed all telcos to bar outgoing calls on unlinked lines.\n\nAs expected, the impact was immediate as millions of Nigerians were blocked from making phone calls and sending text messages \u2014 including Samson.\n\nREGISTERED, LINKED BUT BARRED\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said he had earlier linked his NIN with his Globacom and MTN lines but he recently discovered that the linking process failed for the former.\n\n\u201cI was using an MTN line and I linked the line with the NIN before my phone got stolen. Since then, I\u2019ve been using Glo, and it is Glo that has been blocked. I had gotten my NIN and I just discovered that it has not been linked,\u201d the 37-year-old marketer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting both business and my relationship with people, especially family. I\u2019m into marketing and I can\u2019t call my customers.\u201d\n\nSamuel Wisdom, another subscriber, told TheCable that he got his NIN last year and complied with the government\u2019s directive on NIN-SIM linkage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, according to him, his line was blocked on April 7, three days after the policy implementation started.\n\nWisdom said his network provider, Airtel, said his NIN was not verified and he was then directed to NIMC\u2019s office for a solution.\n\n\u201cI went there and they said it was not registered and that I\u2019d have to fill another form to register again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy with the situation. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m just blocked out. You can\u2019t call anyone \u2014 even if you\u2019re in a difficult place where you need help \u2014 and this is bad.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNarrating his experience, Tobi Tobe, said three days before the government decided to implement the policy, he tried to link his line via MTN\u2019s USSD code, but discovered it had not been verified by NIMC.\n\nTobe said he had got the NIN since last year and was hoping that linking would be a smooth ride. It was not the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA media practitioner, Jerry Agada, said he lost around N1 million from being barred despite linking.\n\n\u201cI linked,\u201d Agada retorted when asked why he did not. \u201cThat was the prerequisite for buying the sim at the Glo office. You can imagine my shock when I discovered my line was barred.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, Abiola Akindele, a fashion designer, complained about losing her clients, while Adanna Lemchi expressed fears about the negative impact the issue is having on her startup.\n\nDuring conversations with affected persons and agents, TheCable learnt that \u2018unverified NIN\u2019 is the most common problem confronting subscribers.\n\nFor instance, Asuquo Etukudo, who took to social media to vent about the situation, said he received his NIN in 2014, but when he tried to link it with his Airtel line, he was told that the number failed NIMC\u2019s verification.\n\nHence, the line was barred.\n\nThe first pix shows my NIN, I obtained in 2014. The second shows message from Airtel that the number couldn't be verified from your office. Therefore my line was barred. What's going on, please. pic.twitter.com/NWqspVIuao \u2014 Asuquo Etukudo (@akpama_mi) May 12, 2022\n\n\u201cI used that same number to link MTN, and to date, I don\u2019t have any issues with that network provider,\u201d Etukudo TheCable.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE LINE/ BANK-GENERATED NIN\n\nSome subscribers, who were barred from making calls after failed attempts to link their lines, said they found that their lines were either \u2018corporate lines\u2019 or the NIN was bank-generated.\n\nFor instance, a user of a six-year-old Globacom line said the company told her that the line was a \u2018corporate line\u2019 after it was barred.\n\n\u201cWhen they were saying \u2018link your NIN\u2019, I linked my Glo only for them to still block my line,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI went to Glo\u2019s office and they told me that my line is a corporate line, which I don\u2019t understand. They checked my record and saw that I had registered the line in my name. How did a line I registered in my own name become a corporate line?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a radio broadcaster, who spoke anonymously, said he learnt that his NIN was bank-generated.\n\nAsked why he did not comply with the government\u2019s policy, he said: \u201cI linked it, but it was not successful because of the bank-generated issue. It has affected my business in so many ways.\u201d\n\nTELCOS FEELING THE HIT\n\nPrior to the policy\u2019s implementation, the telecommunication sector had been staggering since 2020. The sector posted sluggish growth in 2021 largely due to the various policy decisions taken by the government.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed a decline in internet users by 7.99 percent to 141.9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 against 150.8 million in January 2021.\n\nBy implication, mobile telecom operators lost about nine million data subscribers in 2021.\n\nTheCable had reported that MTN lost about 5.1 million subscribers, dropping from 63.9 million to 58.8 million between January and December 2021. Also, Airtel Nigeria lost 2.5 million subscribers between January and December 2021, while 9mobile lost 1.13 million subscribers within the same period.\n\nGlobacom, on the other hand, lost about 470,000 subscribers within the same period, according to data on NCC\u2019s website.\n\nAjibola Olude, executive secretary, Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), said the directive, which affected about 70 million subscribers, signals a loss of revenue for telcos.\n\n\u201cOur members were not happy because at the end of the day, [it] is going to have a negative effect on their profitability which may translate to not meeting their projected revenue for the year,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the NIMC needs to scale up its capabilities, especially in the \u201carea of storage\u201d, so that the issues being reported can be addressed.\n\n\u2018UNFAIR BALANCE OF POWER\u2019\n\nBoye Adegoke, senior programme manager, Paradigm Initiative (PIN), described the restriction on outgoing calls from unlinked lines as an unfair expression of balance of power.\n\nHe said it is a question of whether having NIN should be a prerequisite for being able to own a SIM card in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the government has not done enough in terms of providing the requisite regulatory framework to guide the collection, or issuance of NIN.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a data protection law. Government is not keeping to its side of the bargain but it is using state power to coerce people into keeping to their own side of the bargain,\u201d Adegoke said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfair expression of balance of power. While citizens are left with little or no options in terms of getting the government to do what it is supposed to do in regards to making sure that there\u2019s a law around data protection in Nigeria, it is compelling citizens to [do] whatever it wants citizens to do and going to the extent of using punitive enforcement to achieve that by barring calls of those who have not registered.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s even worse when you now consider the fact that there\u2019re people who want to register but have not been able to due to no fault of theirs.\n\n\u201cSometimes logistical challenge on the part of NIMC, sometimes infrastructural issues, sometimes due to the nature of their work, and that\u2019s what makes it even more shameful.\u201d\n\nAdegoke added that NIN should not be the precondition for accessing basic and essential services.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, Kayode Adegoke, head of corporate communications, NIMC, did not respond to requests for comments on the issues raised.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

Most of the people from there believe that presidency has to go there (South East).\n\n\u201cIf now I decide to be vice presidential candidate to anybody in this country; NNPP will collapse, because the party is based on what we have built in the last 30 years.\n\n\u201cI served for 17 years as a civil servant; we are talking of 47 years of very serious hard work that is what is rarely holding NNPP now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe national leader of the NNPP said he was not against presidency going to any part of the country but it must be done based on \u201cstrategy, political calculation and equation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the South-East are good in business and are well talented but they should learn politics.\n\n\u201cIn politics they are at the bottom line,\u201d Mr Kwankwaso said.\n\nHe stated that the zone lost out on the presidential and vice presidential candidates of both All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but now has a chance with the NNPP.\n\nHe stated that those saying \u201ceven if my friend (Peter Obi) wants to accept vice presidential candidate, some people in the South-East will not accept, that is not strategic.\u201d\n\nHe said Bola Tinubu was strategic to have supported the APC in 2015 and \u201ctoday he is the presidential candidate of the APC.\u201d\n\nMr Kwankwaso said the best option for the South East was for the zone to partner with NNPP, \u201cthis is a golden opportunity, if they lose it, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nOn the choice of his running mate, Mr Kwankwaso said \u201cwe have options in the NNPP in the South to pick a good vice president and one of them is the Labour Party man (Peter Obi) you are talking about.\u201d\n\nOn the chances of NNPP in 2023 elections, Mr Kwankwaso said his party had the structure, organisation and population across the country to contest and win elections.\n\nHe said if elected president in 2023, his vision would be to create opportunities for the youths of Nigeria to get employed, achieved their dreams and be empowered educationally and economically.",

I am talking about internal rancour amongst us. In one, two, three weeks, we will be able to resolve what the issues are. The issues are not about the governorship candidate. I need to sit with them and say, can we move forward.\u201d\n\nReacting to the decision of the Rivers State government to prosecute him over the alleged sales of the state assets, the former Rivers governor declared that neither the police nor any of the anti-graft agencies has invited him for interrogation.\n\nHe said: \u201cI hope that the governor has good lawyers. The Supreme Court said in their judgement that he has powers to set up a panel and the job of the panel is to gather information. That after gathering the information, they should pass the information to either ICPC, Police or EFCC. The police have not invited me; ICPC has not invited me and EFCC has not invited me.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there is what we call fair hearing. At that point when they will invite me, it is called a fair hearing because they will hear my own side of the story. You have not heard my own side of the story and you went to court to do what? Something must be giving you confidence.\n\n\u201cIt is not about being served by the court. The Supreme Court said before you go ahead, you have to send it to the investigating authorities and it is when they finish the investigation that they will decide whether the matter will come to court or not. You have not done any of those things and you are in court. So, what will you be telling the court?\n\n\u201cTwo, everything that was done was done transparently. There was an agency called the Public Procurement Agency and all those things passed through.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about an issue that is before the court. Let the court decide. Tonye Cole did not act in his personal capacity. He represented Sahara Energy. You know this is political because they are afraid.\u201d\n\nHe urged APC members to go and work for the party\u2019s victory, stressing that the election is a contest and one person must emerge victorious.\n\nThe former presidential aspirant defended the Minister-designate, Udi Odum, who is the leader of Abual/Odual local government area, correcting the impression that he was an unpopular candidate.",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call

this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr.

          "title": "Strike: Use Part Of Presidency, NASS Allocations To Meet ASUU\u2019s Demands, SERAP Tells Buhari",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201curgently recover missing N105.7bn of public funds from ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to fund the country\u2019s public tertiary institutions, improve the welfare of staff members, and ensure that the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) return to class without further delay.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cPending the recovery of the missing public funds, we urge you to redirect some of the presidency\u2019s budget of N3.6 billion on feeding and travels, and the N134 billion allocated to the National Assembly in the 2022 budget to meet the demands by ASUU.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201csend to the National Assembly a fresh supplementary appropriation bill, which reflects the proposed redirected budget, for its approval.\n\nIn the letter dated 2 July, 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cMeeting the demands by ASUU would confront the persistent and widening inequality in educational opportunity, and promote equal protection for poor Nigerian children.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Police Rescue Children Allegedly Being Held By Church In Ondo, Make Arrests\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe apparent failure by your government to agree with the reasonable demands by ASUU, implement the good faith agreement with the union and to satisfactorily resolve the issues has kept poor Nigerian children at home while the children of the country\u2019s politicians attend private schools.\u201d\n\nThe ASUU accused the government of poor commitment to the payment of academic earned allowance (EAA); poor funding, the continued use of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System and refusal to adopt the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS), among others.\n\nSERAP said, \u201cMeeting ASUU demands would also ensure protection against the harms of discrimination and educational deprivation.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cThe poor treatment of Nigerian children in the country\u2019s public tertiary institutions is inconsistent and incompatible with the Nigerian Constitution and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWidening inequalities in the area of education bear all the more dramatic consequences given the importance of education, as an empowering right, in giving the possibility to all to explore and realise their potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cInequalities in education have a rolling effect, leading to even more and continued inequalities in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from being a right in itself, the right to education is also an enabling right. Education creates the \u2018voice\u2019 through which rights can be claimed and protected, and without education people lack the capacity to achieve valuable functioning as part of the living.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people have access to education they can develop the skills, capacity and confidence to secure other rights. Education gives people the ability to access information detailing the range of rights that they hold, and government\u2019s obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within seven days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovering the missing N105.7bn of public funds and redirecting the funds, as well as some parts of the presidency and National Assembly budgets to meet the demands by ASUU would end the protracted negotiations between ASUU and the Federal Government and improve access of poor children to education.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovering the missing N105.7bn of public funds and redirecting the funds, as well as some parts of the presidency and National Assembly budgets to meet the demands by ASUU would also be in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed spending of taxpayers\u2019 and public funds would also be consistent with constitutional responsibilities and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecovering the missing N105.7bn of public funds and redirecting the funds, as well as some parts of the presidency and National Assembly would be entirely consistent with your constitutional oath of office, and with the letter and spirit of the Nigerian Constitution, as it would promote equal opportunities for poor children who rely on public schools and have no opportunity for university education elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that Nigeria\u2019s public tertiary institutions have continued to experience a steady decline. The quality of public education offered is low and standards have continued to drop. The learning environment does not promote effective learning.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic school facilities are in a state of extreme disrepair, requiring major rehabilitation. Basic teaching and learning resources are generally not available, leaving many lecturers and other staff members profoundly demoralized.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure to end the ASUU strike has hugely contributed to denying poor Nigerian children access to quality education, opportunities and development. The enjoyment of the right to education for millions of poor children remains a distant goal.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder international law, states are required to progressively implement socio-economic rights including the right to quality education commensurate with the level of resources available. Gross misallocation of resources to the detriment of the enjoyment of the right to quality education can constitute a human rights violation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA violation of the right to education will occur when there is insufficient expenditure or misallocation of public resources which results in the non-enjoyment of access to education by poor Nigerian children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure to meet the reasonable demands by ASUU cannot be justified especially given the failure and/or refusal by the Federal Government to recover trillions of Naira reportedly missing in ministries, departments and agencies, and the huge funds allocated to the presidency and the National Assembly in the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, N105.7bn of public funds are missing, as documented by the Auditor-General of the Federation in his annual audited report for 2018. Also, while the presidency has budgeted N3.6 billion for feeding and travels, N134 billion has been allocated to the National Assembly in the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, ASUU and other university workers\u2019 unions have been on strike for several months. The unions\u2019 demands, among other things, include better funding for the nation\u2019s public tertiary institutions and improved welfare for their members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile your government has reportedly released N34 billion for the payment of minimum wage consequential adjustments from 2019, ASUU has maintained that until its core demands are met, it will not suspend the strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn protest of the continuous use of IPPIS and refusal by the Federal Government to implement the renegotiated 2009 agreement that was completed in May 2021, ASUU resumed nationwide strike on February 14.\u201d",
          "summary": "The quality of public education offered is low and standards have continued to drop.\nThe learning environment does not promote effective learning.\u201d\u201cPublic school facilities are in a state of extreme disrepair, requiring major rehabilitation.\nBasic teaching and learning resources are generally not available, leaving many lecturers and other staff members profoundly demoralized.\u201d\u201cThe failure to end the ASUU strike has hugely contributed to denying poor Nigerian children access to quality education, opportunities and development.\nThe enjoyment of the right to education for millions of poor children remains a distant goal.\u201d\u201cUnder international law, states are required to progressively implement socio-economic rights including the right to quality education commensurate with the level of resources available.\nAlso, while the presidency has budgeted N3.6 billion for feeding and travels, N134 billion has been allocated to the National Assembly in the 2022 budget.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, ASUU and other university workers\u2019 unions have been on strike for several months.",

He was arrested at the screening point before boarding a Qatar Airways flight enroute Doha to Sharjah, with his trip expected to terminate in Dubai, UAE.\n\nThe 39-year-old from Ijebu South LGA, Ogun State, was placed under excretion observation after body scan result confirmed drug ingestion.

A parent walked up to a police station on Friday evening and she said some of her children left home since last week but knows where they were. Policemen followed her to the place and they found out that it was a church and attempt to talk to the pastor and invite him over proved abortive and members who were around turned violent by attacking policemen who were there.\n\n\u201cHowever, at the end of the day, we realised that the church has been keeping the members in an underground room. Basically, what we heard was that the assistant pastor, Josiah, claimed rapture was going to take place by April but later said it has been changed till September. So, he encouraged most of them to stay behind.\n\n\u201cHe also brainwashed the children to obey only their parent in the Lord. Aside from that, we also realised that some of these children left home to be in the church since January. Some even left school for that purpose,\u201d the PPRO noted.\n\nShe added that the suspects would be charged to court upon completion of investigation.\n\nWhile reacting, the 45-year-old Assistant Pastor of the Church, Josiah Peter, said he never hypnotised, brainwashed the church members or disconnected any children from their biological parents.\n\nHe said: \u201cI preach to them, what the Bible teaches. We have been in the church on the basis of God\u2019s instruction through our pastor, Anifowose David. He instructed us to camp for seven days. I am not aware of kids who have failed to write examinations or adults who choose not to work again because of rapture.\u201d\n\nOne of the victims simply identified as Priscilla, who has refused to continue her education, said she decided to seek God before education.\n\nPriscilla who was in 400-level at the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, added that she decided to leave her parents because their preaching was wrong.\n\nFidelis David in Akure",

We must therefore conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018The ocean is key to the global economy, with an estimated 40 million people projected to be employed by ocean-based industries by 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our oceans and seas are repositories of tremendous wealth, in terms of natural capital, ecosystem services, living and non-living resources. We are conscious of the fact that our maritime and aquatic resources are critical for the livelihoods of our people; hence, our commitment to the Africa Union 2063 Agenda and the attainment of United Nations SDG 14.\u201d\n\nThe president also stressed the need for more scientific partnerships and knowledge sharing to protect humanity\u2019s common ocean heritage.\n\nHis words: \u2018\u2018The science tells us that to stop the downward spiral we are witnessing in the ocean, we must fully and highly protect at least 30 per cent of the global ocean by 2030, and dramatically strengthen the management of human activities in the other 70 per cent.\n\n\u2018\u2018This must be reflected in the text we negotiate here as well as in upcoming negotiations planned in December 2022 at the upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) of the Conference of Parties (COP).\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is a member of the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People and the Blue Leaders Campaign.\n\n\u2018\u2018The global community needs to agree to the effective protection of 30 per cent of the global ocean by 2030 at the CBD COP in December, and a robust high seas treaty that doesn\u2019t simply endorse the status quo, but the one that ensures all nations manage their activities in the high seas to prevent significant effects on the ocean.\n\n\u2018\u2018These two steps will go a long way in restoring the health and resilience of our oceans.\u2019\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari has congratulated the Federal Ministry of Transportation, the NPA, and all stakeholders in the maritime industry for the successful berthing of the first ship at Lekki Deep Seaport in Lagos.\n\nThe vessel, ZHEN HUA 28, delivered three Ship to Shores (STS) and 10 Rubber Tyre Gantries (RTG) cranes that will help in the evacuation of cargoes from vessels to the shore.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, commended the staff and management in the nation\u2019s maritime sector who are working round the clock to make the operationalisation of Lekki Deep sea port before the end of the year a reality, reassuring them of his commitment to sustain investments in these new assets.\n\nHe recalled that his approval of four new seaports in the country, including the Lekki Deep Seaport, was hinged on growing the economy, creating massive job opportunities, foreign investment inflows, and trade facilitation.\n\nPresident Buhari recognised that the nation\u2019s maritime and aquatic resources are critical to the livelihoods of Nigerians and the Government will spare no effort in successfully harnessing the potential of the sector\n\nBuhari Back in Abuja after Five-day State Visit to Portugal\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari last night returned toAbuja after a five-day state visit to Lisbon, capital of Portugal.\n\nThe president, whose official aircraft, NAF1 touched down at the presidential wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja at about 5pm, also participated in the 2022 United Nations Ocean Conference, which held in Lisbon during his stay in the country.\n\nPresident Buhari was on arrival by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mohammed Bello; Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba; among other top government officials.\n\nWhile in Lisbon, President Buhari led the Nigerian entourage to the signing of several agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoU).\n\nThe MoUs signed include Political Consultations; Diplomatic Training, Research and the Exchange of Information and Documentation; Cooperation in the Field of Culture; and Cooperation in the Field of Women and Girls Development, Empowerment and Gender Affairs; Youth; and Sports.\n\nAt a business forum organised during the visit, at which some of the MoUs were finalised between the two countries\u2019 investment promotion agencies and chambers of commerce, President Buhari had described the progress in signing the agreements \u2018\u2018as excellent foundations for increased bilateral trade.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president also met with some representatives of Nigerian residents of Portugal, assuring them that the 2023 elections would be credible and peace, even as he admonishing them against inciting political crisis back home, through the use of the social media.\n\nPresident Buhari was accompanied to Portugal by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed; Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo; Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare.\n\nOthers are National Security Adviser, Maj-Gen Babagana Monguno (rtd); Director General, National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ambassador Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar and Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) Hon.

          "text": "The Court of Appeal sitting in Lagos has upheld the appeal filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), against the Lagos Hotel Owners Association of Nigeria.\n\nThe court set aside the Federal High Court judgment in favour of the Lagos Hotel Owners Association of Nigeria.\n\nJustice Rilwanu Aikawa of the Federal High Court on October 3, 2019, declared that the FIRS lacked the powers to collect VAT from the association\u2019s members.\n\nIn 2009, the Lagos State Government enacted the Hotel Occupancy and Restaurant Consumption Law of Lagos State (Consumption Tax Law).\n\nThe Consumption Tax Law imposes a Consumption Tax of five per cent on the value of goods and services consumed in hotels, restaurants and event centres within Lagos State.\n\nThus, consumers of goods and services in hotels, restaurants and event centres suffer both Consumption Tax and VAT on the same tax base, amounting to double taxation.\n\nFollowing this development, the Registered Trustees of Hotel Owners and Managers Association of Lagos (HOMA) sued the AG in Lagos State and FIRS in suit No. FHC/L/CS/360/2018.\n\nThe association sought a declaration that the Consumption Tax Law of Lagos State was inoperable and of no effect, because the VAT Act has fully covered the field on the subject of Consumption Tax.\n\nThe lower court presided over by Justice Rilwanu Aikawa ruled in favour of the Lagos State Government upholding the powers of the state government to charge and collect Consumption Tax.\n\nIn reaching this decision, the court relied on the 1999 Constitution and held that Consumption Tax on goods and services consumed in hotels, restaurants and event centres is a residual matter, which is within the exclusive legislative competence of a state government.\n\nThe lower court upheld the powers of the Lagos State Government to charge and collect Consumption Tax from hotels, restaurants and event centres within the state.\n\nIt also restrained the federal government from collecting VAT on goods consumed in hotels, restaurants and event centres.\n\nAccording to the court, Consumption Tax on hotels, restaurants and event centres is in the purview of the state government based on the 1999 Constitution and the Taxes and Levies (Approved List for Collection) Act (Taxes and Levies Act).\n\nIt said the provisions of the VAT Act in respect of the consumption of goods and services in hotels, restaurants and event centres are inconsistent with the Constitution and the Taxes and Levies Act and are therefore void.\n\nThe court further held that under the Taxes and Levies Act, Consumption Tax arising from transactions involving the sale of goods and services in hotels, restaurants or event centres is to be collected by the state government.\n\nThe court also stated that since the Taxes and Levies Act (as amended in 2015) was enacted after the VAT Act of 1993, its provisions have tacitly repealed any provisions of the VAT Act concerning hotels, restaurants and event centres and should thus prevail.\n\nIt, therefore, restrained the FIRS from collecting VAT on transactions relating to the consumption of goods and services in hotels, restaurants and event places in Lagos.\n\nDispleased with the verdict, FIRS proceeded to the Court of Appeal and subsequently secured a stay of execution pending the outcome of the appeal filed.\n\nBut in a judgment on Friday, the appellate court set aside the Federal High Court\u2019s judgment. It also struck out a counter-claim filed by the Lagos State Government against the FIRS.\n\nHowever, there is also an ongoing legal tussle between FIRS and some state governments on the issue of VAT collection.\n\nBut no date has been fixed for the hearing of the case at the Supreme Court.\n\nWale Igbitade",
