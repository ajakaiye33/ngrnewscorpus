          "text": "Lara Adejoro and Amarachi Okeh\n\nHaving lupus \u2013 a long-term autoimmune disease \u2013 can be quite exhausting, as a result of the huge cost of management and fear of organ damage. Women living with the incurable disease share their experiences. LARA ADEJORO and AMARACHI OKEH report:\n\nWhen 21-year-old Deborah (not real name) began experiencing severe recurring joint pain in 2018, little did she know that it was a sign of an incurable disease knocking at her door.\n\nNo one in her family, including her parents, could figure out what the severe joint pain was all about. Her parents kept treating her for malaria and typhoid.\n\nAfter several visits to different hospitals, Deborah was finally diagnosed with systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE), at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.\n\nSince then, life has not been easy for her, as the condition, which comes with seasons of flares and remissions, currently has no cure, according to experts.\n\nAccording to experts, lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when the body\u2019s immune system attacks its tissues and organs.\n\nThey also described lupus as a disease with 1000 faces because it has an extremely variable course.\n\nInflammation caused by lupus can affect different body systems and organs \u2014 including the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs.\n\nSharing her ordeal with PUNCH HealthWise, Deborah said, \u201cIt started in 2018 with mostly joint pain and then swelling in my fingers; then it led to weakness and loss of appetite. I was even limping when it started.\n\n\u201cAt first, I went to the school clinic and they said it was typhoid, malaria, low immunity, and all that. They treated malaria. They gave me drugs for about a week. \u201cAll those symptoms went away and then resurfaced.\n\n\u201cI also went to a private hospital and the same thing was diagnosed. Not until I got to Alimosho General Hospital, where I was treated and then referred to LASUTH.\u201d\n\nIt was at LASUTH that rheumatologists diagnosed Deborah with SLE\n\nThe undergraduate, who is currently battling a kidney problem as a result of a flare, said the condition has changed her physical appearance.\n\n\u201cMy body has changed, my face is puffy, I have suffered hair loss, and my stomach is bloated.\n\n\u201cThen, there\u2019s the leg swelling. Emotionally, I have been having depression, anxiety, and worry.\n\n\u201cIt has also affected my social life; my academics \u2013 I have missed a semester already due to the flare. This is the second semester and I have still not been able to resume. So, it has affected me a whole lot,\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking on the financial impact of the disease, the 21-year-old lady, said, \u201cIt\u2019s like hell for me and my parents. It\u2019s been difficult getting the money for treatment because I am not the only child; we are five in the family. We have to take care of others.\n\n\u201cThe prices of drugs are high. At first, where I was getting them from, the cost was double; until someone told me somewhere else to go which was half the initial price. Sometimes, they\u2019re so scarce and difficult to get,\u201d she said\n\nShe said she spends not less than N60, 000 monthly on medication\n\nDeborah used to think she was under a spiritual attack prior to her diagnosis but meeting people who are also living with this incurable disease has helped her to know that she is not alone.\n\n\u201cAt first, I thought it was a spiritual thing. We kept going from one church to another seeking solutions but I have accepted it now since I am not the only one. I have seen other cases.\u201d\n\nAlso battling with this chronic disease is a 44-year-old mother of one, Mojisola Oginni.\n\nOginni said she started having hip pains in 2006 for which she was treated at an orthopaedic hospital.\n\nAfter being tossed about by different doctors and diagnoses, she was finally diagnosed with SLE in 2011.\n\n\u201cI was sick to the extent that I could not talk. I was having serious chest pain that I couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\n\u201cThey treated malaria for like four to five times before malaria could leave my body. I had joint pain, neck pain, and shoulder pain.\n\n\u201cIt was at Air Force Hospital that I was diagnosed then referred to LASUTH in 2011 for treatment.\u201d\n\nThough SLE is characterised by episodes of flares and remissions, Oginni said she has been lucky because she rarely develops severe flares.\n\nThe lady who works in a microfinance bank said, \u201cI\u2019m somehow lucky that I don\u2019t really have severe flares. Apart from when it was diagnosed, I don\u2019t really have flare seasons because I am a strong person. Sometimes, I may be having pain and you would not know.\u201d\n\nDespite the chronic disease, Oginni\u2019s resolve remains strong, and according to her, \u201cLupus is my friend, I don\u2019t have flares.\u201d\n\nLike Deborah, finances for the medication remain a challenge for the mother of one\n\n\u201cIt is money-consuming. You would spend money. The drugs alone are expensive. The work I do is very serious. In a normal situation, I am not supposed to work in the sun but because I need something to do and I don\u2019t want to be a beggar.\n\n\u201cI need to buy drugs so I need to do the job,\u201d Oginni said.\n\nOginni spends more than N50,000 monthly on medications\n\nHer supportive husband has been her rock since her diagnosis while they were still dating. Together, she and her husband are fighting the disease.\n\nAnother SLE patient, Ms. Favour Michael, recounting her symptoms prior to diagnosis more than 25 years ago, said she experienced all the symptoms of lupus.\n\n\u201cI was just going through one thing or the other. Everything that could happen \u2013 encephalitis, neurological and dermatological issues \u2013 I suffered all of them. There was nothing I didn\u2019t suffer from.\u201d\n\nShe described lupus as a disease that deceives people\n\nThe retired banker said, \u201cThis lupus is something that deceives people. You can wake up one morning and see that you are very fine but the next 20 to 30 minutes, you\u2019d just feel somehow and you are wondering \u2018but when I woke up this morning I was feeling okay\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd then you go to the hospital and it\u2019s something else entirely they are saying,\u201d she said.\n\nContinuing, Michael said, \u201cWhen you are having flares it presents itself in different ways. It could be your kidney or the heart. So, if you are having a kidney problem at that time \u2013 which on several occasions I have had \u2013 the money you will spend for that period will not be the same when you are out of it.\n\n\u201cLupus is a disease that you\u2019d tell yourself that \u2018I am going to have hope no matter what.\n\n\u201cIt is what I call hope in adversity. Most people see it as a death sentence but I see that there\u2019s hope no matter the adversity.\u201d\n\nA Consultant Rheumatologist at LASUTH, Dr. Hakeem Olaosebikan said \u201cLupus mimics other diseases such as infection and cancers, and therefore, this may lead to late diagnosis and misdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cLate diagnosis means the disease is already advanced and organ damage may have occurred. Organ damage in lupus is rarely reversible and wrong diagnosis means wrong treatment and this may lead to more complications.\u201d\n\nOlaosebikan, who is also a lecturer at the Lagos State University College of Medicine, further said the symptoms of lupus are \u201crecurrent malaria-typhoid illness. Our patients often present with progressive fatigue, joint pain, painful joint swelling and low blood level.\u201d\n\nOther symptoms he listed are recurrent hair loss, sores in the mouth and throat, as well as rashes in the face.\n\n\u201cSymptoms of kidney, brain, lungs and heart involvement are common in those that present late to the hospital,\u201d he further said.\n\nA professor of Medicine and Consultant Rheumatologist at LASUTH, Prof. Femi Adelowo said lupus is a condition many doctors may not be familiar with, but which is managed by specialists called rheumatologists.\n\nWhile the cause of lupus remains a mystery, it has some predisposing factors\n\nAdelowo said, \u201cWe honestly do not know for certain (the cause) but there are various hypotheses/theories. It may be a mix of predisposition (genetic); environmental such as sunlight, infections, drugs; or abnormal immune system. But then, certain suggestions have been made.\u201d\n\nThe don said the risk factors for the autoimmune disease include race (Black or Hispanic), family history, female gender, use of contraceptives, excessive sunlight, and certain cosmetics.\n\n\u201cWhile it can affect all age groups including children, it mostly picks on women of child-bearing age, with an average of 34 years.\n\nIn a yet-to-be-reported study, the number of SLE patients documented in various rheumatology clinics in Nigeria was close to 1000 patients in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to the daily medications, a Consultant Dermatologist at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Erere Otrofanowei, advised patients with lupus to avoid ultraviolet (light), wear light-coloured long-sleeve clothes, and use Sun Protection Factor creams.\n\nOtrofanowei said that precautionary measures, such as sun avoidance, using sunscreen, and wearing sun-protective clothing would assist in preventing aggravated symptoms of the disease.\n\nWhile there is no cure yet for lupus, Adelowo said that \u201cresearch is going on currently to find a cure.\n\n\u201cBy cure, we mean a magic bullet drug that you can take, and that is it. No more doctor\u2019s visits or drugs.\n\n\u201cHowever, it can be well managed if diagnosis and presentation are made early and if the affected person takes her/his drugs and attends the clinic regularly.\n\n\u201cAlso, those affected should avoid alternate medicines. They should rest especially when the sun is out. They should also exercise and eat a balanced diet.\u201d\n\nFoundations, such as Meblevi Lupus Foundation owned by Safinat Emengo, are providing a sense of community and rendering support to lupus patients\n\n\u201cThe foundation is very important to people living with lupus because it gives warriors a sense of calm and belonging, knowing that someone else can relate to their pain and are willing to help as well,\u201d the founder said.\n\n\u201cSome people with lupus don\u2019t even want to talk about it because they feel no one truly understands.\n\n\u201cBut with a foundation like ours, you get to meet different people who are dealing with lupus. We have support groups where you can speak to like-minded people when you feel down. Also, you can learn how to manage lupus by knowing all the dos and don\u2019ts.\n\nEmengo, who has lived with lupus for more than 20 years, further said the foundation has helped some lupus patients with free and subsidised medications, access to professionals who can manage lupus, as well as creating awareness about the disease.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Stock\n\n*\u2026targets oil installations, politicians\n\n*PANDEF asks militants to stay action\n\n*Violence only language FG understands \u2013 NDYM\n\nBy Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South; Egufe Yafugborhi and Chioma Onuegbu\n\nLEADERS of the Niger-Delta, last night, counseled militants who threatened to resume hostilities in the region over failed promises by the Federal Government to stop their plans and follow the path of peace, saying violence was no longer fashionable in conflict resolution.\n\nThe leaders spoke through the Pan Niger-Delta Forum, the mouthpiece of monarchs, leaders and stakeholders of the coastal states of Niger-Delta, against the backdrop of the threat by Niger-Delta Avengers, NDA, to attack targeted oil installations and political actors perceived to have colluded with the Federal Government to undermine the people of the oil-rich region.\n\nMeanwhile, a body of youth groups in the region, Niger Delta Youth Movement, NDYM, threw its weight behind the decision of the militant group to resume attacks on oil installations, saying violence was the language the Federal Government listens to.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, PANDEF, Hon Ken Robinson, who spoke to Sunday Vanguard, also said the regional group was making efforts to authenticate the genuineness of the militant group that issued the threat.\n\nA group claiming to be NDA, the feared militant group that practically crippled the nation\u2019s economy about four years ago, had, in a post on its website, titled, \u2018We are back with Operation Humble\u2019, at the weekend, stated: \u201cThis operation shall be coded Operation Humble aimed at bringing down targeted oil installations in the Niger Delta region capable of humbling the economy into permanent recession.\u201d\n\nRejecting a restart of violence in the region, PANDEF said: \u201cBut, our general thought to our young people is that we cannot take the path of violence any longer. Otherwise we expose our communities, our people, even our young people themselves to unnecessary harm.\n\n\u201cCommunities will be destroyed in the name of looking for supposed militants. And innocent persons, our young people will be killed in a way that they don\u2019t act against the bandits and the terrorists in the North-East and the North-West. We see what they are doing in the South-East.\n\n\u201cSo, as leaders of the region, we are appealing to the young people. In the face of all these provocations, let us still look for non-violent ways to express our dissatisfaction and our disaffection.\n\n\u201cThat is the right way and what we will continue to do while we continue to call on government, federal and even the states to begin to also take aspirations of the people more seriously.\u201d\n\nAuthenticity\n\nOn the authenticity of the group, Robinson stated: \u201cI can categorically state that, in 2016, we intervened and the aggrieved youths listened to us under Niger Delta Avengers (NDA).\n\n\u201cWe will try to confirm the authenticity of this release, whether it is an authentic group or some persons who are just making claims. We have people in the Niger Delta now who have become laptop militants. We are aware of that.\n\n\u201cSo, we will ascertain authenticity of this group, but the fact remains that, after four years, nothing much has been done by the Federal Government (FG) (in the Niger Delta). We visited Mr. President on November 1, 2016 and presented to a 16-point demand that cuts across critical issues across the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cOf course you are also aware that following our visit and presentation of demands, the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osibanjo, then as Acting President, undertook a visit to all states in the region and interacted with the people during which the demands were reemphasized.\n\n\u201cThe Acting President, at that time, made very far-reaching pronouncements, including relocation of International Oil Companies (IOCs) headquarters to the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cOut of the 16 demands, as we speak, over four years after, we have the Ffederal Government attending only, as it were, to one and a half. That is Ogoni clean-up and the Maritime University, Okerenkoko.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Maritime University was a joint item involving the establishment of the Maritime University, Okerenkoko and upgrade of the Maritime Academy in Oron to a university.\n\n\u201cThat has been the situation and, of course, we acknowledge that people are angry, people dissatisfied. There\u2019s disaffection in the region and people are worried.\u201d\n\nPanic had gripped the oil industry, yesterday morning, as the NDA said it had exhausted the last iota of patience with the Federal Government and the high command decided, last Friday night, to wake up the government that had been sleeping on its responsibilities.\n\nThe frightening post read in part: \u201cThis mission is also targeted at political actors who are collaborating with the Nigerian Government to undermine the interest of the Niger Delta people.\u201d\n\n\u201cConclusively, we wish to state unequivocally and in simple terms that we are back with Operation Humble; with the aim of humbling the economy into permanent recession and political players from the Niger Delta extraction to political retirement.\n\n\u201cOur Strike Teams 01 \u2013 09 and all other formations are to regroup and remain on red alert awaiting further command.\n\n\u201cThere will no going back until the Nigerian economy is humbled into recession never to rise again,\u201d it added.\n\nThe group announced it had \u201clost total confidence on all socio-cultural groups like PANDEF, elders of Niger Delta and the bunch of so called ex-agitators frolicking with the government at our detriment.\u201d\n\nDeaf ears\n\nIt went on: \u201cThere is no doubt that the Nigerian government has continued to pay deaf ears to our demands and the rising challenges in the country because the pipelines that crisscrosses our lands her left untouched, allowing dollars to flow into the federal treasury on a daily basis for mismanagement.\n\n\u201cWe shall spare no single oil installation within our range of strategic targets marked for destruction in the coming days and we bet the Nigerian government will be humbled to return to the drawing board and chart an all-inclusive course by the time we are done with our action plan.\n\n\u201cMembers of our strike teams across the Niger Delta are commanded to be on red alert awaiting precise strike plans as mapped by the high command of the NDA.\n\n\u201cThe high command of the NDA has promoted and appointed one of our finest operatives, Field Commander Tu-ere aka Queen of the Creeks to the rank of Brigadier General.\n\n\u201cShe is an experienced field agent who before now was the head of the counterintelligence unit of the NDA, using her connections with top government and security officials to deliver on her assignment.\n\n\u201cShe was part of the our elite Strike Teams that attacked and took down the Chevron Valve platform on the 4th of May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line on the 3rd of June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline on the 11th of July, 2016.\n\n\u201cBrig. Gen. Tu-ere is the first female to ever attain this level and it is solely out of merit, and is placed in charge by the High Command of the NDA to execute operation humble to the later.\n\n\u201cAs a gender friendly organization, we are using this avenue to encourage other female operatives within the rank and file of the NDA to be inspired by the rising profile of the Queen of the Creeks and never to deter in delivering on our mission of liberate our people and God given resources from the shackles of the oppressive Nigerian government. We advise other female operatives to emulate her and be dedicated to our mission at all times.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying that the failed country called Nigeria which has fed fat on our God- given wealth is at the brink of total disintegration owing to the security and related challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cRanging from terrorism and banditry in the North to the secessionist gongs of the Oduduwa people of the Southwest and IPOB of the Southeast it is obvious that peace in the Niger Delta and by extension the South-South geopolitical region is the very thin piece still binding this country together.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening that despite being the economic backbone and having resolved to maintain the peaceful environment for the smooth operations of the oil multinationals whose proceeds the country cling unto for economic survival the Niger Delta and the South -South remain the most under developed with our needs and interests undermined by the failed Nigerian State.\n\n\u201cWe decided to suspend our famous Operation Red Economy\u201a which bled the Nigerian economy into recession about four years ago not because we are lazy but for the love we have for our people and out of respect for the voice of the elders of the Niger Delta region, who beckoned on us to give peace a chance and avail the government time to act on our demands at the time.\u201d\n\nLanguage\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Vanguard also on the threat, National President of NDYM, Comrade Joe Jackson, said it was unfortunate that agitation and violence had remained the only language the Federal Government of Nigeria understands, especially when it concerns issues affecting oil producing areas of the country.\n\n\u201cWe will want to align with the Niger Delta Avengers, the only language the Federal government understands is violence and agitation. Those issues are like recurring decimal. We have protested against gas flaring in our communities, because of environmental and health hazards,\u201dJackson stated.\n\n\u201cAlso look at the Ogoni clean-up which the federal government initiated, but till date nothing serious has been done about that, but you hear of billions of naira being earmarked. When will the federal government be sincere to the plight of the Niger Delta people?\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a disappointment that our representatives at the National Assembly as well as the Ministers have remained mute over the plight of the region. For instance on the demand for the upward review from 2.5 per cent to 10 per cent appropriated to host oil communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\n\u201cThey know that 2.5 per cent is not adequate, it is not enough to take care of the environmental and health hazards, pollution suffered by oil communities, but they will not say it. Why can\u2019t they say let us review these laws for the benefit of our people.\n\n\u201cIt is sad and unpatriotic that it is only when there is an attack(s) on oil installations that the Federal Government will now listen or react. Since that is the only language that they understand we will support, urge the Avengers to go ahead.\u201d\n\nJackson alleged that lack of attention from the Federal Government to the plight of the Niger Delta people was a deliberate attempt to subdue the people and their area.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In whose interest is it if we all accept this as a crime of passion?\n\nThe culprit, Chidinma Adaora Ojukwu, an innocent looking, soft spoken 21-year-old University of Lagos female undergraduate, spoke to the assembled press in a calm and measured tone, stating that basically, they had a drug-fuelled sex tryst that got out of hand when he tried to rape her, hitting her head against the wall and she grabbed a knife and stabbed him twice.\n\nShe also stated that she stole his money afterwards, using his ATM card and pin number that he had freely given her prior, asking her to take any amount she wanted but that she had declined, telling him that it was not what she wanted.\n\nShe also admitted to \u2018helping\u2019 herself with some money from his account after killing him and that she only stole N380,000 as opposed to N5m that was transferred from his account, and when asked why she stole from him, she answered that she needed the money for her school fees.\n\nThe Police have since also released a statement saying amongst other things, that the suspect CONSPIRED WITH OTHERS, NOW AT LARGE, and allegedly murdered one Michael Usifo Ataga. The short service apartment where the alleged murder was committed was secretly booked by the suspect on the 13th of June 2021 and that she left the apartment after the deed had been done on the 15th of June 2021.\n\nA fake driver\u2019s license bearing Mary Johnson with the suspect\u2019s photograph, was found amongst her belongings at her home, as well as a blood-stained cloth, ostensibly worn on the day of the murder.\n\nThe suspect confessed to using a kitchen knife to stab the deceased and that she took away the evidence, the blood-stained knife and discarded it in a dustbin by her house. She also admitted to stealing his iPhone.\n\nThe owner/manager of the service apartment said that the suspect called to book using a USA WhatsApp number and claimed that she had just arrived in the country and was at the airport and needed a place quiet to quarantine and that her passport was held at the airport because of Covid.\n\nAfter taking the apartment, the suspect called the Manager/Owner and security guard a few times and all the time, she made sure to block her number, including after committing the murder, to extend her stay and ask them not to disturb the room, and again to enquire from her if the deceased\u2019s vehicle had been taken away, unaware that the said Owner/Manager was already helping the Police.\n\nDays after the incident, no one could describe her because according to the Owner/Manager and all her staff, she always wore face masks. The Security guard at the premises stated that the suspect had come to the gate to receive delivery from a delivery man who later told him after the suspect had taken her delivery, that it was drugs.\n\nAll parties involved in this ugly incident have now spoken, barring Usifo Ataga, who is no more. The dead cannot talk, so it is with Usifo. Who will speak for Usifo Ataga? I pray the facts of the case speak for him, especially as we consider that no amount of chicanery, sophistry, blatant lies and/or conjectures can defeat the evidence of solid facts.\n\nWhat are the facts that we know? Usifo died a horrific death. He was not stabbed 2 or even 5 times; he was stabbed multiple times. His hands were bound tightly, and the marks were still all over his wrists, accompanied with evidence of torture and assault even as his corpse lay in the morgue.\n\nAnd no one in the entire building heard his screams because he was gagged. Let that sink in: he was bound, gagged and tortured! The now-viral video of the room with the deceased lying on the floor, shows a room with blood-stained walls and floor, evidence of a ferocious struggle. One person could never have carried these out!\n\nShe claims that Usifo Ataga tried to rape her. How preposterous can one really get? The truth is that the allegation of an attempted rape is such an easy and convenient one for any woman alone in a room with a man to make.\n\nEven if both of them are alive, without CCTV, how does the man conclusively prove that he didn\u2019t make such an attempt? The credibility of those involved and circumstances around the case must come into play in search of the truth.\n\nA man you claim to have been sleeping with and that you were so eager to sleep with him that you eagerly booked an apartment yourself and came to expressly sleep with him, not for a few hours but for days on end, and that he had already slept with you twice, tried to rape you and hit your head against the wall with no evidence of head bruises, even as you left the apartment that same day? Come on, the story doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nThis is the same woman it has now come to the fore that at least on one occasion, 3 to 4 years ago, was arrested for blackmailing a married man and using an innocent security man\u2019s bank account to collect the money. She must have been at most, 18 years old then, if not younger! She is clearly a pathological liar, remorseless, calm and assured, and didn\u2019t start today.\n\nShe said they did drugs. The toxicology reports are not out yet, but if any drug is found in Usifo\u2019s system, then it makes this dastardly act even worse, he must have been surreptitiously drugged!\n\nIn this day of bank transfers, whoever gives you their Bank card and pin number, when they can easily transfer any amount to you, if indeed he gave her his card and said take anything you want, as she claimed? Did he also give her his BVN? How did she obtain it?\n\nUsifo Ataga\u2019s company had some substantial amount of money in an Escrow account, and the first attempt was to try and move the money. Was this done before or after Usifo Ataga had been killed? Then someone sent in instructions trying to change his Banking security details, and that flagged up the account and the account was promptly blocked.\n\nShe claimed that she wanted money for school fees, did she need a billion Naira for her school fees? The fact was that because these funds were in an Escrow account, torture Usifo Ataga all you wanted then, he simply could not, and was not able to move even a dime from the money even if he wanted to!\n\nThen, his money in another account was now moved to his account that they had his ATM card and then went on siphoning his funds. The speed and sophistication of these dealings were alarming.\n\nThe facts in a nutshell tell us that this incident was neither an accident nor a drug-fuelled sexcapade gone wrong! It was a premeditated, well-set-up conspiracy to murder. One person, however strong could not have tied and gagged Usifo Ataga and then carried out all that was done, talkless of this woman.\n\nThe police who have more evidence than I have stated here, have explicitly stated as such. Those still pandering to these salacious slants of these social media stories are just unnecessarily muddying the waters. This is as clear a case of conspiratorial homicide as you will ever get given the circumstances.\n\nAnd just as Abel\u2019s blood cried out for vengeance from the ground, as the good Scripture says, and in the absence of anyone speaking for Usifo Ataga, may Usifo\u2019s blood shed so callously all over that apartment floor and walls by cowards, speak volumes on his behalf.\n\n*Aniemena, a friend of the deceased, writes from Lagos\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDelta Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, has urged Nigerians not to compromise the country\u2019s unity as its strength lay in citizens\u2019 collective bond.\n\nOkowa made the call in his remark at a state banquet in honour of members of Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures at their 2021 Second Quarter General Meeting in Asaba, on Saturday.\n\nHe said that the country was facing serious challenges that required leaders to preach hope to the people and ensure that the unity of the nation was not breached.\n\nREAD ALSO:Nigerian collaboration, dream come true \u2013 Zimbabwean Wayne F.O.G\n\nHe stated that there was need for dialogue on how to ensure fairness and equity in the governance of the country.\n\nAccording to Okowa, there is need for leaders to give hope to the people because if the leaders begin to lose hope in the nation, the followers will be in trouble.\n\nHe stated that at critical times as was currently prevailing in the country, people in sensitive positions, including Speakers of legislatures, were required to truly help to build the nation.\n\n\u201cIn very trying times such as this, we must ensure that we continue to give hope to our people and that we continue to do the very little that we can even in our various constituencies because a little hope can encourage those who would have felt helpless.\n\n\u201cWe need to continue to pray for our country, Nigeria and we need to realise that the unity of this country is important to us all and that everything that ought to be done we will continue to stay focused in doing those things that will keep this country united.\n\n\u201cBut, I also believe that for everyone of us in government, as we continue to preach unity, we must be sincere about it; we must ensure that there is fairness and equity and we must stay committed to the original principles that brought us together.\n\n\u201cWe are one people in this country and I believe that the strength of Nigeria lies in our collective responsibility because in that truly lies our strength.\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that ought to be discussed, but we are not discussing yet; there is a need for a true dialogue even when people tend to misconstrue it when we speak about dialogue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about coming to quarrel, it\u2019s about protecting the inside of us so that we can become greater brothers for the future and I think that it\u2019s important we understand that when we speak that it\u2019s not about division but about unity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how we can begin to love ourselves and about how we can become more participatory in the totality of the governance of this nation and it is in the best interest of this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor remarked that Nigerians loved the country and we wished to remain united, and advised that the things that will make us stronger, \u201cwe need to discuss them so that we can stay together and build a nation that our children can be proud of.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue as a nation where everybody, particularly the professionals, are thinking about going outside the country; it cannot continue to be so.\n\n\u201cWe are in tough times but leaders must stand up to think for the people and as you return to your various states, please carry along with you the message of hope that it is well with this country and there is great hope for the future.\u201d\n\nChairman, Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures, Rt Hon. Abubakar Suleiman, commended Governor Okowa for his passion in the development of Delta.\n\n\u201cI congratulate Deltans for the kind of Governor God gave to them because we have gone round and have seen a lot of developmental projects across the state.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised because he is a legislator and a parliamentarian and because a state where the Governor respects the other arms of government, particularly the legislature, will definitely benefit from the partnership between both arms of government.\n\n\u201cWe went round and we have seen a lot of your projects and we saw developments everywhere. When resources are matched with the resolve to work for the people, the result is development.\n\n\u201cWe will make your keynote speech a template and a model of executive-legislature relations in the country. We appreciate you for all that you have done to make our stay memorable,\u201d he said.\n\nIn separate remarks, Speakers of Houses of Assembly of Enugu, Kogi, Ogun, Katsina and Taraba all commended Governor Okowa for his outstanding accomplishments in Delta and urged him to continue in his service to the state and country.\n\nThey stressed that the Governor had exemplified and demonstrated that the principles of separation of power could be sustained without one man lording it over others.\n\n\u201cYou are indeed a role model and we have seen vision in you and we know that God will reward you for your great services to your state and country,\u201d they said.\n\nThe host Speaker and Deputy Chairman of the Conference, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, thanked Governor Okowa for agreeing to host the conference.\n\nHe stated that the Assembly was committed to partnering him to build a Stronger Delta.\n\nHe commended his brother Speakers for coming to Delta and urged them to remain committed to the growth and development of the country.",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nThe Federal Government says it will continue to engage in fisheries subsidies negotiations, in order to achieve balanced and equitable outcomes from the forthcoming WTO\u2019s 12th Ministerial Conference (MC-12) on fisheries subsidies.\n\nOtunba Adeniyi Adebayo, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, said this at a virtual meeting of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Ministers of Trade on Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) will be convened by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3, 2021, in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe WTO\u2019s Ministerial Conference, which is held every two years, is the highest decision-making body of the WTO and attended by trade ministers and other senior officials from the organisation\u2019s 164 members.\n\nThe minister noted that the sustainable development of the fisheries sector was central to Nigeria\u2019s quest for economic diversification and sustained growth.\n\nAccording to the minister, it is of critical fundamental importance that the outcomes of the MC-12 are consistent with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.6 and our mandate.\n\nSDG 14.6 targets to prohibit certain forms of fisheries\u2019 subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, as well as eliminate subsidies which contribute to Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\nHe said that given that sustainable development of the sector was a viable route to Nigeria\u2019s socioeconomic development, it expected MC-12 outcomes on fisheries subsidies to result in substantial reduction of overfishing and unsustainable fishing practices.\n\nAdebayo thanked Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General, World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the Chair of the Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations, Amb. Santiago Wills of Colombia, for their efforts at advancing the negotiations.\n\nHe recalled that the contribution of the fisheries sector to Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 0.84 per cent and 1.09 per cent in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\u201cNigeria, which produces less than a million-metric tonne of fish annually is a net importer of fish. Marine catches contribute about 38 per cent of our annual output. The rest is made up of inland waters catches and aquaculture.\n\n\u201cOver 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total domestic production is generated by artisanal small-scale fishermen that support the livelihoods of over 24 million Nigerians. 73 per cent of those involved in fisheries in Nigeria are women,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe explained that the country, with a continental coastline of 853km and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) area of 179,839 sq. kms, contained diverse species of fish, contributing to food and livelihood security of Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, he noted that illegal fishing, overfishing and other unsustainable fishing related activities, incentivised by heavy subsidies posed a major threat to sustainable development of Nigeria\u2019s fisheries sector.\n\nHe advised that the outcomes should also reflect the \u201cmutual supportiveness of trade and environment\u201d by addressing simultaneously the three pillars of sustainable development as envisaged in the Hong Kong and Doha Ministerial Declarations.\n\nAdebayo further noted that such outcomes should contain effective Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) that allow for sustainable development of the fisheries sector of developing countries.\n\nThe minister described S&DT as an integral part of the sustainability agenda of the WTO, adding that it was also crucial to achieving an acceptable balance of rights and obligations among WTO members.\n\n\u201cI am of the view that these S&DT provisions would not only undermine our rights to sustainable exploitation of marine resources in our EEZ, guaranteed by the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, but would also undermine efforts to address our food and livelihood security difficulties.\n\n\u201cNigeria expects carve-out for developing countries under all pillars in respect of fishing and fishing related activities of low income, resource-poor fishermen within their EEZ, with no preconditions.\n\n\u201cAs well as exemptions of developing countries, with less than two per cent share of annual global marine capture, from some obligations of the disciplines,\u201d he said.

          "text": "Following the timetable recently released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Osun State Governorship Election, lead actors in the politics of the state have commenced massive mobilisation to determine the likely candidates of the leading political parties, reports Associate Editor, Sam Egburonu\n\nOsun State\u2019s politics has received fresh breath following the recent timetable released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Osun State Governorship Election scheduled for July 16, 2022.\n\nOur investigation during the week shows that some of the political leaders in the state did not waste time at all after INEC\u2019s announcement before reaching out to the field coordinators of their political structures to commence mobilisation.\n\nINEC has fixed date for the conduct of the 2022 governorship election in the state for July 16, 2022. The commission\u2019s statement, signed by Rose Oriaran-Anthony, INEC Secretary, said notice of elections and every other build up would begin on February 15, 2022.\n\nShe added that collection of Form EC9 (formerly CF001) and EC9B (formerly CF002) for the election by political parties on INEC website would be on February 16, 2022, adding that February 16 to March 12, 2022 is fixed for political parties to conduct their primaries and resolve disputes that may arise from them.\n\nAccording to the commission, \u201cThe tenure of the Governor of Osun State will expire on the 26th November 2022. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 178 (1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and Section 25 (7) and (8) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended), the earliest date for the Election into the office of the Governor, Osun State, shall be the 28 June, 2022 and the latest date for the Election shall be 27 October, 2022.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of the provisions of Section 178 (2) of the Constitution and Section 25 (8) of the Electoral Act, Election into the office of a. State Governors shall hold not earlier than 150 days and not later than 30 days before the expiration of the term of office of the last holder of the office.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is by virtue of Section 30 (1) of the Electoral Act, expected to issue Notice of the Election not later than 90 days before the date of the Election.\n\n\u201cThis is in exercise of the powers conferred on INEC by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1959 (as amended) and the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and of all other powers enabling it in that behalf,\u201d the notice read in parts\u201d, part of the statement read.\n\nIt also listed March 25, 2022, as the date for the publication of personal particulars (EC9) and April 8 as the last day for the withdrawal/replacement of candidates by political parties.\n\nThe notice also stated April 17, 2020, as the date for the official commencement of campaigns by parties.\n\nBattle of the Lords kicks off\n\nIn the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, the battle of the political lords has already become a public issue. Barely days after INEC announced the governorship election date, some party stakeholders rang the opening bell when they gave a hint that Senator Ademola Adeleke, the party\u2019s former governorship candidate during the 2018 election, may be adopted as the party\u2019s candidate in the 2022 election.\n\nThe PDP Director of Media and Publicity in the state, Oladele Bamiji, who made this disclosure on a radio programme, however said the adoption of Adeleke will not stop any other aspirant from contesting the primaries.\n\nAccording to him, every interested aspirant is free to come and test the primaries in the state. Recalling the 2018 PDP primary in the state where, according to him, Adeleke performed excellently to emerge the party\u2019s candidate, he denied the allegation that the party is planning to sponsor a sole candidate for the election.\n\nIn his words, \u201cAdemola Adeleke emerged as the PDP flagbearer in the 2018 election even though he was not the favourite to win the party primaries.\n\n\u201cThe reason for the Adeleke candidacy is not far-fetched. He was victorious in 2018 until it was stolen from Abuja.\n\n\u201cEvery aspirant must face the people in the primaries and it is possible for another aspirant to win\u201d.\n\nAs would be expected, this suggestion has sparked off a heated debate as supporters of businessman cum politician, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, expressed shock at the suggestion of the party sponsoring a sole candidate.\n\nIt would be recalled that the two political leaders were also rivals during the last primaries leading to the last governorship election in the state. At the end of the election, Ogunbiyi rejected the outcome of the party\u2019s primary, and alleged that the election was rigged in favour of Adeleke. He alleged that \u201csome infractions compromised the integrity of the exercise and made the results clearly unacceptable.\u201d According to him, such infractions include \u201cnon-adherence to the clear provisions of the electoral guidelines and unfortunate manipulation of the accreditation, voting, sorting and counting of the votes cast by delegates at the primaries.\u201d\n\nAlthough the two political leaders fought deeply, the two camps later reunited towards the 2018 governorship election. It was however alleged that the reconciliation followed some negotiations and agreed secret pact. However, since Adeleke lost the governor\u2019s seat to the candidate of APC, there has been uneasy calm in the camp of the two political gladiators. With the announcement of the timetable for the 2022 elections, especially with the suggestion that Adeleke may be adopted as the sole candidate, the battle line has been redrawn.\n\nFor example, Osun State federal lawmaker, representing Ede/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, Hon Bamidele Salam, re-ignited the fire when he repeated the suggestion of the party\u2019s leaders that seemed to suggest that Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi may not stand a chance of clinching the governorship ticket of the party in 2022.\n\nHe was quoted as saying: \u201cI know Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi very well; he is a brother that I respect so much, but you know that when we talk about politics, we talk about the name, influence, and networking. Ogunbiyi is nowhere near the Adelekes. I give him due honour; he is a very good and capable man but he can also be very useful in other areas but certainly not as the governor this time around.\u201d\n\nReacting to this assessment of their political leader, the political campaign group of Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi during the week berated the Osun Federal lawmaker, Hon Bamidele Salam, for what they described as \u201cdampening of the quest of businessman cum politician to contest election on the platform of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) in 2022.\u201d\n\nA statement signed by the Director of Strategy, Idera de Movement, Kunle Omolere, said that Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi is eminently qualified and possesses the required qualities to lead the PDP to victory.\n\nHe said that \u201cdesperate attempts at blowing off Ogunbiyi\u2019s candle would not brighten Ademola Adeleke\u2019s chances in the 2022 governorship election.\n\n\u201cOgunbiyi is better placed and, given his track record of service to humanity and growth, having stimulated several businesses from nothing to stardom will make a good governor if saddled with the lofty responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful and rather ridiculous seeing Bamidele and other supporters of the absentee aspirant banking on irrelevancies, guilt and manipulation to push his ambition instead of rolling out the unique selling points of the man, if he has any, apart from his good dancing steps.\n\n\u201cPDP delegates and the general public have seen through and know the aspirant who will not make a good governor if given the chance. They know the aspirant with the improbable academic record.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWill Oyetola, Aregbesola\u2019s supporters agree on APC ticket?\n\nIn the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), there is fear that the forthcoming primary election may not be an easy exercise as many believe that it may provide an opportunity for the current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola and the incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola to settle their alleged old scores.\n\nParty insiders in the state, who expressed this fear, alleged that although Aregbesola is the immediate past governor of the state, who handed over to Oyetola, there has been no love lost between the two since 2018 when Aregbesola left office and handed over to Oyetola.\n\nNotwithstanding that the two leaders had on several occasions denied having any rift between them, close observers allege that their actions and body language, also reflected by their supporters and loyalists, confirm that they are hardly on one page, especially on how APC affairs would be administered in the state.\n\nAn top stakeholder in the state, who is a party chieftain in the state, told The Nation in confidence that the matter had been brought to the party leaders in the Southwest zone and at the national level. \u201cThis matter has been reported to our leaders in the Southwest zone and in Abuja. But unfortunately, the two leaders do not agree at all. This has affected our party here in Osun. I can therefore confirm to you that as we approach a fresh primary election, there is fear within the party that supporters of the two leaders will use this opportunity to wage a political war. How this will pan out is yet to be seen,\u201d he said.\n\nIt would be recalled that it was Aregbesola, then as the outgoing governor that campaigned for Oyetola, who served as his Chief of Staff till 2018 and assisted him to emerge as governor. But after Oyetola emerged as the governor, some of his aides alleged that Aregbesola, the minister, wanted to remain the leader, calling the shots in Osun State APC. The governor\u2019s aides said such an arrangement did not go down well with Oyetola.\n\nSo, as the ruling party prepares for the forthcoming primary election, The Nation learnt from some insiders that Governor Oyetola\u2019s bid to fly the party\u2019s flag for a second term may not go unchallenged. As our source puts it, \u201cOrdinarily, we expect Governor Oyetola to be given an automatic ticket to contest for a second term. But following the disagreement between the governor\u2019s supporters and former governor Aregbesola\u2019s supporters, everyone expects a possible formidable opponent. So, if this happens, the primary election may be contentious,\u201d he said.\n\nNotwithstanding the intrigues already playing out amongst the top political leaders, some possible aspirants, aside Adeleke and Ogunbiyi have been mentioned in the media. They include,\n\nAlhaji Fatai Akinbade, 65, the 2018 African Democratic Congress (ADC) governorship candidate; Senator Olasunkanmi Akinlabi, 64, a former Minister of Youth Development, who aspired for the PDP Governorship Ticket in 2014 and 2018 respectively, but lost at both attempt; Prince Ayoade Adewopo, the Convener of \u201cAyombo Si Ipinle Osun Movement\u201d.\n\nWith the INEC\u2019s announcement, it is expected that more aspirants will emerge and the battle will heat up.",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt/Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\nMandate South-South governors to set up common security outfit to fight banditry\n\nMilitant group Avengers returns, threatens attacks on oil facilities, politicians\n\nThe South South geo-political zone has raised the ante in the agitation for the restructuring of the country, handing down a three-month ultimatum to the federal authorities to start the process of giving Nigeria a new lease of life.\n\nNiger Delta leaders emerged from a meeting in Port Harcourt late Friday asking the federal government to convene a national dialogue for the purpose of charting a new course for the country.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) announced its return to the creeks ahead of launching what it called Operation Humble to destroy targeted oil installations in the region.\n\nThe Niger Delta leaders, in a communiqu\u00e9 at the end of a South-South zonal conference in Port Harcourt, said the dialogue they are advocating should draw its membership from all ethnic groups to chart a new course for the country.\n\nThe conference had as its theme, \u201cRestructuring: imperatives for sustainable development, unity and security.\u201d\n\nThey spoke of an urgent need for the devolution of powers to the states and vowed to resist oppressive and repressive tendencies against the Niger Delta region and its people.\n\nThey appealed to the Federal Government to stop selling their resources to the Chinese and others.\n\nThe stakeholders, who came from the nine states of the region, threatened to actualise their freedom if nothing happened at the expiration of the ultimatum.\n\nThe communique was read by prominent Niger Delta activist and President of Agape Birthrights Development Initiative, Ms. Ann Kio-Brigss.\n\nThe communique: \u201cWe the people of the Niger Delta hereby give the Government of Nigeria a three months window within which to cordially address our concerns towards re-federalising the polity, by convening a national dialogue of the representatives of the ethnic groups in Nigeria to chart a new course for the country.\n\n\u201cAt the expiration of this three months window, we the people of the Niger Delta will commence the process that will guarantee our freedom and progress.\n\n\u201cOur people should mobilise all human resources to see that fiscal federalism and devolution of powers are included in the constitution. There should be internal justice amongst us- charity begins at home.\n\n\u201cWe the people of the Niger Delta hereby reaffirm their commonality, unity and oneness despite our multi-ethnic diversities.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people, who are the breadwinners of Nigeria, demand to be heard and fairly treated with equity by the oppressive Nigerian state, and by extension, the insensitive Nigerian political class, as the only basis for peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cWe the people of the Niger Delta demand restructuring, with the states as the federating units and devolution of more powers to the states.\n\n\u201cWe the ethnic nationalities of the South-South affirm the right of peoples to self-determination and to fully control their resource to stop and put an end to further deprivation and despoliation of their environment which they have suffered in the last 60 years.\n\n\u201cThe people of the Niger Delta will take all lawful measures to develop an agenda for freedom and liberation and development of the region.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta ethnic nationalities hereby demand that the governors of the South-South immediately set up security outfits in their respective states and network with each other in the region to protect our territories against terrorists, criminals, land grabbers and other criminals who often operate as bandits and kidnappers.\n\n\u201cNiger Deltans demand that the governors of the South-South region immediately set up community based defence forces in all local government areas of the South-South.\n\n\u201cThe ethnic nationalities of the Niger Delta demand the Federal Government of Nigeria to immediately discontinue the selective appointments, posting and deployment of mainly non- Middle-Belt and Southern Nigerian security officials to the Niger Delta to oppress our people.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta demands equal representation, control and headship of all relevant security and military organisations in the country. The Niger Delta demands and expresses the desire for a provision in the Nigerian constitution for the exercise of the inalienable right to self- determination through a referendum in line with international laws.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta demands total ownership rights to lands, natural resources, seas and waters by communities wherever such are located in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta has resolved to put an end to all oppressive and repressive tendencies by the Nigerian State against our region and warns that we shall no longer tolerate same from other nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people demand immediate environmental remediation and clean-up of Niger-Delta which has been deliberately devastated by crude oil exploration and exploitation.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta governors should as a matter of extreme urgency take the issue of food security as to prevent the starvation of our people in the event of any food blockade.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta governors are to ensure protection of the flora/fauna and take interest in general environmental protection, including endowments above or beneath the soil for sustainable development.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta people demand that the federal government desists from selling out our resources to the Chinese or Sukuk promoting countries, to secure any project.\n\nThe Niger Delta People demand their enjoyment of the right to own and bear arms for self defence as law-abiding citizens. The selective grant of firearms licences is hereby condemned and denounced. This is necessary considering the present state of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe people of Niger Delta demand the establishment of State Police in their respective states.\u201d\n\nThe Port Harcourt meeting came 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) and promised to follow the lead of the National Assembly to implement the wishes of Nigerians on restructuring.\n\nBuhari said he would not hesitate to endorse any move by the National Assembly on restructuring.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part,\u201d he told the Professor Benjamin Okaba-led delegation of the INC.\n\nOnly penultimate Saturday, the President had branded agitators of restructuring and secession as mischievously dangerous and na\u00efve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are telling us to dissolve a system and call for an obscure conference to come and discuss how we can move forward as a nation, that can never be done and no country will agree to that,\u201d Buhari had said in a message to the launch of the Kudirat Abiola Sabon Gari Peace Foundation in Zaria, Kaduna State.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose who are discussing restructuring, my question is that what are you going to restructure?\n\n\u201cIf you ask many Nigerians what are they going to restructure, you will find out that they have nothing to talk about.\n\n\u201cSome of them have not even studied the 1999 Constitution. The 1999 Constitution is almost 70 to 80 per cent 1979 Constitution.\u201d\n\nNiger Delta Avengers returns with Operation Humble to cripple economy\n\nIn a separate statement, the Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) said it was staging a return to the creeks to launch Operation Humble designed to destroy targeted oil installations in the region.\n\nThe statement was posted on NDA\u2019s website.\n\nIt threatened to hit political actors collaborating with the Federal Government to \u201cundermine the interest of the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\nStakeholders had warned the Federal Government and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, of the consequences of reneging on their pledge to constitute a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) by the end of June.\n\nThe month ends on Wednesday.\n\nThe NDA said that it suspended its Operation Red Economy\u201a which bled the Nigerian economy into recession about four years ago not because it was lazy but for the love it had for the people and out of respect for the voice of the elders of the Niger Delta region.\n\nAlthough NDA made no mention of the NDDC board issue in its latest statement, it hinged its decision on the underdevelopment of the region and the undermining of the collective interests of the people of the region.\n\nThe NDA, after a meeting of its high command, said it had lost confidence in all socio-cultural groups like the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), the elders and \u201cthe bunch of so-called ex-agitators frolicking with the government at our detriment\u201d.\n\nIt said: \u201cThis operation shall be coded Operation Humble aimed at bringing down targeted oil installations in the Niger Delta capable of humbling the economy into permanent recession. This mission is also targeted at political actors who are collaborating with the Nigerian government to undermine the interest of the Niger Delta people.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Nigerian government has continued to pay deaf ears to our demands and the rising challenges in the country because the pipelines that crisscrosses our lands are left untouched, allowing dollars to flow into the federal treasury on a daily basis for mismanagement.\n\n\u201cWe shall spare no single oil installation within our range of strategic targets marked for destruction in the coming days and we bet the Nigerian Government will be humbled to return to the drawing board and chart an all inclusive course by the time we are done with our action plan.\n\n\u201cMembers of our strike teams across the Niger Delta are commanded to be on red alert awaiting precise strike plans as mapped by the high command of the NDA.\n\n\u201cThe high command of the NDA has promoted and appointed one of our finest operatives, Field Commander Tu-ere aka Queen of the Creeks to the rank of Brigadier General. She is an experienced field agent who before now was the head of the counter intelligence unit of the NDA, using her connections with top government and security officials to deliver on her assignment\u201d.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cShe was part of our elite Strike Teams that attacked and took down the Chevron Valve platform on the 4th of May, 2016; the Shell Forcados 48-inch Export line on the 3rd of June, 2016; and the Exxon Mobil Qua Iboe 48 Crude Oil Pipeline on the 11th of July, 2016.\n\n\u201cBrig. Gen. Tu-ere is the first female to ever attain this level and it is solely out of merit, and is placed in charge by the High Command of the NDA to execute operation humble to the letter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs a gender friendly organisation, we are using this avenue to encourage other female operatives within the rank and file of the NDA to be inspired by the rising profile of the Queen of the Creeks and never to deter in delivering on our mission of liberate our people and God given resources from the shackles of the oppressive Nigerian Government. We advise other female operatives to emulate her and be dedicated to our mission at all times.\n\n\u201cConclusively, we wish to state unequivocally and in simple terms that we are back with operation Humble; with the aim of humbling the economy into permanent recession and political players from the Niger Delta extraction to political retirement.\n\n\u201cOur Strike Teams 01 \u2013 09 and all other formations are to regroup and remain on red alert awaiting further command.\u201d\n\nNavy: we\u2019re not aware of any threat to attack oil facilities\n\nContacted on Saturday over the Niger Delta Avengers\u2019 threat, the Nigerian Navy said it was not aware of any such statement.\n\nBut it said it was battle ready for groups threatening to carry out attacks on critical oil installations in the Niger Delta region or any other part of the country.\n\nThe Director of Information Nigerian Navy, Commodore Suleiman Dahun, told The Nation that the Navy was well positioned to protect all oil installations in the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any such threat, but you can be rest assured that the Navy is positioned to deal with any threat to peace and order,\u201d Dahun said on the phone.\n\nNiger Delta Affairs Minister Godswill Akpabio said on Tuesday that Nigeria could not afford to have crisis in the South South now on account of its economic importance to the nation.\n\nAkpabio told reporters after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, that he was doing his best to ensure peace, especially in the Niger Delta, because of its strategic economic importance.\n\nHe also said he had fast-tracked action on the constitution of the NDDC board and that the names of nominees would soon be forwarded to the National Assembly.\n\nAkpabio, however, said the ongoing field forensic audit to the commission must be completed as the outcome would serve as a guide to the board\u2019s operations.\n\nAccording to him, the audit report should be turned in by the end of next month.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nThe Senator Andy Uba Campaign Organization has congratulated members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State for a successful governorship primary held across the 21 LGAs despite initial logistical issues.\n\nHe noted that there was delayed movement of materials to wards for accreditation and voting.\n\nThis came as Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, Saturday evening, called for the postponement of the exercise to Tuesday, June 29, due to the hiccups experienced across the State.\n\nDirector-General of the campaign organization, Chief Paul Chukwuma in a statement in Awka, praised the doggedness of APC members who remained patient all through the process.\n\nOn the call for the postponement of the primary by Ngige, the Campaign Organization faulted him wondering why the leader of the party in the State will call for a shift of an election that had ended successfully just because the outcome was not going in favour of his preferred candidate.\n\nAccording to the Campaign organ, this stand by Dr. Chris Ngige lends credence to the rumours going round that he is in cohort with the ruling APGA to support a weak aspirant to emerge as APC candidate in order to pave way for the APGA governorship candidate to have a smooth run.\n\nChukwuma, also berated those aspirants that alleged irregularities in the primary election for raising false alarms. He noted that all the aspirants were given everything they needed by the Primary Election Committee but some were angry that they could not hijack the whole process hence the resort to blackmail and cheap propaganda.\n\nOn the purported outburst of the Publicity Secretary of APC in Anambra State, Okelo Madukaife against the conduct of the primary, the campaign organization cautioned party officials against taking positions that were inimical to the party\u2019s unity.\n\nThe statement called on well-meaning members of the APC to maintain confidence in the Gov.

          "title": "I like smart, God-fearing men \u2013Jemeriye Adeniji, singer",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nUS-based Nigerian singer/songwriter, Jemeriye Adeniji has performed across the globe. Recently, she played at the 70th birthday shindig of Mrs Nike Okundaye, proprietress of Nike Arts Gallery, which held at Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nAdeniji, whose Ewa Global Initiative showcases the beauty of Africa, in this interview dwells on her kind of man, among other issues. Enjoy it.\n\nWhat is the difference between being an artiste in the US and an artiste in Nigeria?\n\nI live in Pennsylvania. So, between the United States and Nigeria, we have some similarities and we have some differences. Music in Nigeria is different from music in the US. Their experiences and struggles are pretty different from each other. If you are not sure of yourself, or you are confused of your art, you\u2019ll get lost in the American system. For music, the more original you are, the better for you. The more original you are, the more they appreciate you. Americans celebrate what makes you tick; they embrace you when you are real. We have access to some things (in America) that we don\u2019t have access to here in Nigeria. As an artiste, you don\u2019t need to be a millionaire to own a stage. If you are good and you know what you do, you will be celebrated and appreciated when you stay true to your art. You will be seen and noticed. It is not about \u2018man know man\u2019 as it is here. Americans appreciate originality and sometimes you can have access to grants that could take your work to different level if you have good network.\n\nYou dress all covered up unlike most American artistes, what informed your style of dressing?\n\nFor me, you dress the way you want to be addressed. Dressing for me depends on how I feel. I want some respect and if I feel like dressing up, I dress up.\n\nWhat would you say about female artistes who show cleavages?\n\nThe truth is sex sells. Sometimes the struggle is real. Some of them believe if they are not dressed like that they won\u2019t be noticed or even heard. If your art has to do with the way you dress, be creative about it. Keep some decency to yourself, if you can. I don\u2019t want to knock anybody\u2019s hustles because I don\u2019t know what works for you. If exposing your body has helped you get to where you are going, merry Christmas and good luck. I don\u2019t like to knock anybody\u2019s hustles; it\u2019s a big market. If you think what you do is pleasant, keep it up. Like I said, I don\u2019t want to knock anybody\u2019s hustle.\n\nWhat\u2019s your kind of guy?\n\nI like smart men. Not too smart, though, not the type that wants to be in my nose that I can\u2019t even breathe. I like a man who is smart and disciplined. I like a God-fearing man, a man who appreciates and feels confident in his own woman and also in himself. I don\u2019t like a man who tries to control me and judge everything I do, and act like he owns me. As an artiste, you will not get to wherever you want with a man who is so domineering and possessive. I like a God-fearing man and a man who is understanding.\n\nDo you prefer a black or white man as a spouse?\n\nBlack is very sweet. White is sweet too. I\u2019m about the heart. If my heart connects with you, I can be younger or older; it doesn\u2019t matter to me. As far as you have a good heart, you care for me and I care for you too. Love has no colour, no age. Only you know what you feel. Others can say whatever they want.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Agitations: Nigeria\u2019s break up real \u2013Prophet Olagunju",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nThe division among Yoruba leaders over the quest for the independence of Yoruba nation will not affect the realization of the agenda. Prophet Wale Olagunju of Divine Seed of God Chapel Ministries, Ojoo, Ibadan, who made this known said despite the confusion over the seeming rivalry between the two Yoruba leaders, Pa Ayo Adebanjo, Afenifere leader and Prof Banji Akintoye, leader of Ilana Omo Oodua, the dream for an independent Yoruba nation, remains the ultimate target of both groups.\n\nThe popular seer insisted in this interview that the Igbo, like the Yoruba, are also determined to leave Nigeria, maintaining that nothing will hinder their desire for an independent Biafra nation.\n\nHe also spoke on other major national issues.\n\nYou have been speaking about the break up of the Nigerian nation since 2002. Considering the agitations by the Yoruba and the Igbo, would you say this has a link to your prophecy?\n\nThe break up is real. You know God is not a man that He should lie. God has been revealing this to me since 2002 as you may have read it severally. I stand by that prophecy. One million Buharis cannot stop it. The misery of this break up was what the Lord revealed to me many years back that the man that God will use to achieve this purpose will emerge in 2015. So, definitely it is this Buhari. The Yoruba are determined to leave Nigeria and nobody can stop them, they are going. Another important thing behind the break up is the APC government. Why are they marginalising the Igbo? What is their offence? Why are they killing them on daily basis? To me their offence is simply because they want Biafra nation. You don\u2019t trust them. The northern elements do not trust the Igbo, they don\u2019t trust Yoruba, you don\u2019t want them to rule Nigeria and yet you are saying they should not go. Do you marry someone by force? To me only an irresponsible person will say the Igbo and the Yoruba should not go. Every generation has their own battle to fight before getting freedom just like the biblical Israelites. So, this generation must fight their own battle. Now is the time for the Yoruba to rise up.\n\nProf Banji Akintoye and Pa Ayo Adebanjo who are believed to be the leaders of the Yoruba are not on the same page as far as the agenda for an independent Yoruba nation is concerned. Don\u2019t you think this will create confusion which will may make the realization of the Yoruba agenda a tall dream?\n\nThere is nothing like rivalry between Pa Adebanjo and Emeritus Professor Akintoye. First and foremost, Pa Adebanjo is the leader of Afenifere while Emeritus Professor Akintoye is the leader of Ilana Omo Oodua. So, everything is in order. There cannot be any confusion, each of them is pursuing his own agenda and ultimately they will arrive at same junction.\n\nOn Senator Bola Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition come 2023, don\u2019t you see this in contrast wth the Yoruba agitation?\n\nYes, you are right. It shows that Tinubu is working against the interest of the Yoruba race. He is pursuing his own personal agenda at the expense of the entire Yoruba race and he will fail woefully. The picture of Tinubu in the heart of every Yoruba now is that of a traitor, the Yoruba will never support him and neither will the Igbo. If Tinubu is truly a Yoruba leader which he claimed to be, he should always be found allying with the Yoruba agenda. For someone who claimed to be fighting the course of his kinsmen and stylishly pursuing a different mission is not good. I make bold to say it, Tinubu is a traitor. Tinubu should learn from history, nobody has ever betrayed the cause of Yoruba and succeeded in life. Tinubu should readily see himself as failure which he is. We should not limit ourselves to Tinubu alone, we need to think about other people who claimed to be leading the Yoruba and are found in conspiracy with Tinubu, the majority of Yoruba people are seeing them as traitors and truly they are.\n\nThe death of Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua was recently announced; how did you receive the news?\n\nIt was a sad news, though the Lord had revealed it to me long time ago which I predicted. That does not mean I should be rejoicing over his death. I have read a lot of uncomplimentary remarks about his death, that does not concern me, my belief is that everyone of us shall give up the ghost one day and shall definitely give account of whatever we do in the flesh. So, those who are saying all sorts of things about Temitope Balogun Joshua after his demise are all wasting their time and saliva as they are not in position to judge him. My prayer is that God will forgive them.\n\nWe now seem to be in the era of civil protests in Nigeria. what is your take on this?\n\nWell, I am not in support of Buhari-must-Go protest, but I am in full support of that of Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye for self-determination. I am not in support of Buhari must go protest even though it is in order, because it can never achieve any meaningful result. It is my belief that people need to learn from EndSARS protest. I don\u2019t understand what the current protest is aiming at. Are they saying Buhari should go or they want to force him to resign? It is a mere waste of time, resources and energy. They cannot force Buhari to resign. Buhari will not resign, in a country where tribalism reigns supreme, the northern people will stand solidly behind him. It will result in loss of lives and It is an impossible mission. The people organizing the protests should avoid losing innocent lives to security operatives who may counter their protests. What I advise Nigerians to do is just to stay indoors and pray fervently unto God just like the Israelites who cried to the Almighty God who heard their prayers. Nigeria is now in soup and, in fact, the hottest part of soup in the hand of General Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nYou know Nigeria is now in the hands of myopic leaders who are only out to loot. You discover now that they move from APC to PDP or from PDP to APC, to wherever they feel they will be able to make enough loot. This is rampant among the Southerners. Call me anything, I am not bothered, I fell in love with General Babangida\u2019s two party system with Option A4 and I believe it is the best for Nigeria. With that system, you don\u2019t have the opportunity to decamp and rejoin another party. Today, when I look at the situation in our country, I feel so bad. Look at what these politicians have done in the last 20 years, they have bastardized everything. I now begin to think if this is the same Buhari of 1983 now hobnobbing with looters of our treasuries. So, how do you want me to be praying for Nigeria under this situation. What I am doing now is what God has instructed me to do, to set up a Directorate of Divine Intercessory for the Yoruba nation, of which I am the director. You\u2019ll discover that Yoruba people need prayer in the face of this calamity, if we want to avoid it, we must pray. What is happening in the country today is a very terrible situation which requires urgent prayers failing which the entity called Nigeria may not survive.\n\nPresident Buhari and Nigeria are currently in the news for Twitter ban. What is your own view on Twitter ban by Nigeria?\n\nNigerians using twitter have never committed any offence to warrant the ban placed on them by their president. The Twitter management or whatever name you call them has the right to remove whatever they feel is not right for the world to see, after all they removed a post by the former United States President, Donald Trump and he did not as a result of that place any ban on US citizens from using Twitter. The ban Is wrong and uncalled for. For President Buhari to be threatening any Nigerian who uses Twitter with legal action is totally uncalled for, grossly immature and must be condemned by all.\n\nWhat do you make of the call by the self-acclaimed freedom fighter, Sunday Adeyemo popular called Sunday Igboho who has again called on the Fulani herdsmen to live the Southwest?\n\nThe fact of the case is that Alhaji Abdulai Yerima, the Arewa Consultative Youth President started this by calling on the Igbo to leave the North and nobody queried him for it. To me, Sunday Igboho is a Yoruba militant leader who never carried a gun. He saw that his people are being massacred on daily basis without the government doing anything about it. So, how does that become an offence? The Federal Government does not see anything bad in the herdsmen who are using three weapons: Juju, AK 47 as well as their trust in the Federal Government\u2019s backing; to fight other ethnic groups, but they are busy pursuing Sunday Igboho for fighting the course of his people. The action of the Federal Government is only helping in propagating the course of Sunday Igboho and the entire Yoruba race. The Yoruba people now see him as their saviour. What I think Sunday Igboho needs to do is to watch his tongue and should stop insulting Yoruba elders.\n\nWhat is your advice for the people and government of Nigeria?\n\nFirst and foremost, I am confused as to what advice I can give President Buhari who happens to be a chronic unrepentant tribalist. But not withstanding I will advise him to dissolve his present cabinet which consists of people with no idea on how to move Nigeria forward. He needs to inject fresh blood into his government. Let him scout for people with fresh and brilliant ideas, that can help to move the country forward. My advice to the Yoruba and Igbo is to seek the face of God in holiness and pray fervently unto God of Abraham who saved the Israelites from the hand of Pharaoh and the task masters to put an end to the marginalization and killing of Yoruba and Igbo and to take them to the Promised Land because the killing is getting out of proportion.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenator Abdullahi Adamu is representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District in the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nIn this interview, he indicted state governors for not doing enough to police their domains. He also lampooned them for frustrating restructuring. He spoke on other national issues: What do you make out of this current situation in the country?\n\nIt is the first time since I have come of age that somebody will just get up and say anything about the government and go scot free. A lot of people today sabotage this government by the day. Even people who are under oath are sabotaging this government today. So, what do you expect? Those who are willing and lurking by the corner to do bad have now got the leverage. They have now got people who are even in government who are not showing satisfaction, loyalty, patriotism. How do you expect somebody who has such tendencies to go along, just waiting for an opportunity? These are some of the issues that together have placed us where we are today. And nobody can single-handedly, no matter what power you give him, can get us out of this mess. It has to be all of us Nigerians to get us back on track. This is not to say that Buhari\u2019s government is blameless. I am not suggesting that at all. What I am saying is that we are contributing more to creating problem for the government than what we are doing to solving the problem of the government. This government is our government. It was elected. No matter what we say. The National Assembly has PDP, APGA there and the YPP, APC are there, so everybody is there. There are people from every part of this country in the National Assembly and also in the executive. Take a look at the federal cabinet. Every state in this country has a minister. Some even have two. The idea is that, they are supposed to bring value and add to Buhari\u2019s capacity. Where are they? What are they saying today? Is there anything in this country that says a minister cannot talk? If a governor can talk, a minister cannot talk? What are we are doing? Everybody just fold his hands and Buhari unfortunately for us, is not the talking type. If he were to open up, you will wish you are down the drain. But God has given him the capacity to absorb. It is part of the characteristics of a leader. Yes, there are certain things that have happened. Yes, also he was supposed to react and respond to, but we have people who are not patient. You saw a problem today and you want a solution today. I don\u2019t want to sound like I am justifying what you may see as failure, but I am giving my own thoughts as to why I think we are where we are and why I think most Nigerians who have the responsibility are not living up to their billing. If I am in government, you expect something from me. I am also part of government. I cannot exonerate myself. Most of us that say we are educated, even if you went to a missionary school, there was a contribution of this government in educating you. So, there is a contribution the public have made in preparing you to be where you are today and as a patriotic citizen, one would expect some level of concern, and the concern would not be genuine if you become a critic. Even a critic can be positively critical, but where it is just a matter of picking whatever you want to pick and then throw it out without caring about the implication, it is not good. It is just bad.\n\nRecently, there have been different groups with agitations here and there. The Southern Governors met in Asaba. They called it the Asaba Accord. In that accord, they called for many things, including the ban on open grazing, call for structuring. Why do you think these agitations are popping up now?\n\nThey are sounding like a broken record. You know what a broken record does? It cracks. I expected them to be more educated people with responsibility of governance. Each of those governors is under an oath for loyalty, for preservation of the sovereignty of this country. That means everyone of them is duty bound to stay away from any act or words that have the tendency of being perceived as being separatists. I was a governor for eight years. I know what the Governors\u2019 Forum is. I headed it for five years of my right years. Before that, I was chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum. So, the secretariat you see and the bureaucracy I set them up during my time. Those that took over from us we began to have a situation. This is because we are in a democracy and people will come from a zone and bring a shopping list to the president. There are people in the cabinet and the National Economic Council, National Council of States. They will get themselves out and come and talk for their states or their zone only. They hold meetings almost every year or twice. They have a meeting of all stakeholders, ranging from private citizens, captains of industry, who have made a mark, who are respected in some parts of the country. They hold meetings publicly and come out with a communique. Among them, are people who have served this government and they will make pronouncement against what the government is doing. Before the Asaba Accord, there was a meeting of all the state governors. About 36 of them were there. Less than a week of that meeting, some people came out and claimed Southern Governors Forum. There is nothing wrong with regional bodies. But these governors know the constitution and they know that every Nigerian has the right of movement and association. A right to pursue legitimate goals. These governors are saying no cattle or open grazing. What is the alternative? Have they provided any? If Northern governors come together and take a position, what will happen? What right have you to tell Nigerians not to move freely? If northern groups say no southern business in the area, how will that end up? There are killings of northerners going on in the South. If the North decides to retaliate, we will call it geniocde. What is happening to us? We only know about problems, but not solutions. People are openly calling for a break up of the country.\n\nPeople have attributed some of the agitations in the country to the leadership style of President Muhammadu Buhari. Do you agree?It is too wide a statement. When you\u2019re talking of somebody\u2019s leadership qualities, you don\u2019t just pass a judgment. We have the misfortune of combining situation with Boko Haram and other insecurity challenges. It is unfortunate. We must get one fact very clear. This thing didn\u2019t start with Buhari. Yes, there are a few cases and increase in insecurity. I cannot deny that. That will be unfair. But the major problem is the failure of state administrations to take up the issue of security seriously. Just like Buhari, every governor has taken an oath to protect the lives and property of the citizens. They get money from the Federation Account and also generate revenues from their states. These are the facts. We agree that the central government needs to handle the issue, but states have to play complementary roles in tackling the issues too. Go and take an inventory of the number of states paying salaries today. This is not just about Buhari. States are not paying salaries even with the Paris Club refunds and others they\u2019ve gotten. If you\u2019ve small problems from the various states, overtime, they aggregate and they become big problems. Suddenly, they refer to the problems as Buhari\u2019s problems. Every state governor has a responsibility to provide for their people. Nobody said Buhari was an angel. Nobody also said because Buhari is now president, every state governor should abandon his responsibility.\n\nWhy are these agitations on the rise?\n\nSome of these agitations are induced. Few years ago, were they talking about break up of the country? Why now? Political leaders are in support of what their people are doing. They cannot speak up and challenge them. They just lament. They want the president to handle it. They are talking about restructuring. What is new there? When you and I know that we passed a law in the National Assembly. We tried to free state assemblies, judiciary too. Is Buhari responsible for that? Local governments were created by law. We have tried to free them. Governors are opposed to it. Is Buhari responsible too? How long have we had this aberration? They operate a joint account with local governments. But do these funds go to them directly? I was a governor. Local givenments used to get their funds directly. We created some development areas. We followed the law. Not a dime was taken. Now, local governments can\u2019t execute projects. They don\u2019t see any money. Local governments don\u2019t even get their money. These issues are affecting our democracy. We want to give Buhari a bad name.\n\nEfforts were made by the National Assembly to free up the Local government and assemblies. Even the state judiciary as part of moves to restrcutire\u2026\n\nThat was part of restructuring. What is even this restructuring? Those saying they want us to take a look at the Exclusive Legislative List. We don\u2019t have to fight over restructuring. We have two chambers that can handle that. They were elected. This is our job. If you\u2019re dissatisfied with the issues in Nigeria, you can bring these issues to the National Assembly. They don\u2019t want that. They want to blame the president. There is nowhere the president can alter the constitution. He can\u201dt even give an order for that to be done. And these agitators are educated people. Take the issues to us and Buhari will assent to it. We keep saying that Nigerians didn\u2019t write the constitution. Was it Buhari that wrote it? Why is everybody calling Buhari? It\u2019s sickening. There is a limit. Not that we can\u2019t talk. We have the capacity to do more. But what we won\u2019t take likely is for any part of this country to think that they have a louder voice. That is not true. When the North starts talking, maybe there will be sense. If we want this country to stay on, we will. I speak as a Nigerian of northern extraction. I will defend that as long as I live. Those who want to leave can go. We will continue to exist as one Nigeria. Let\u2019s see where they will go. Seperatists are taking laws into their hands and we are tolerating them. They shout about human rights. We need to stop. It won\u2019t do us any good. No country has survived two civil wars. Army generals have told me that. We must watch out and guide against another war. We should be careful about what we say. These agitators can go. But we will remain.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Buhari: Drug Trafficking, Abuse Pose More Threat than Insurgency, Banditry",
          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The President Muhammadu Buhari-led government has for two years been funding IPI Solutions, a software engineering firm owned by Adamu Garba to produce Crowwe, a platform, that would help the government silence existing social media platforms in the country.\n\nAccording to People's Gazette, more than two years after the Buhari regime invested public funds into Garba\u2019s application, there is little hope, however, that taxpayers would see a bang for the buck.\n\nPeople's Gazette obtained bank documents that carried a transfer of funds from the Central Bank of Nigeria to Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, a software engineering firm run by Mr Garba.\n\nThe company developed and deployed the Crowwe social media app.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria on May 21, 2019, transferred N136.8million to Garba\u2019s IPI Solutions, documents said, marking one of several transfers that sources said the Buhari regime paid to Garba in the course of building the Crowwe app.\n\n\n\nAlthough a major beneficiary of the social media storm that weakened the Goodluck Jonathan administration and amplified the opposition\u2019s messages ahead of the 2015 presidential election, Buhari has relentlessly railed against the negative influence of social media since coming to power.\n\nAfter realising the enormous control that social media has in shaping public opinion, even amongst citizens with little education or financial ability to be on the Internet, Buhari started introducing different tactics to regulate online speech.\n\nA few months after assuming office in 2015, members of his ruling APC pushed a so-called social media bill that civil liberties campaigners said was too offensive to be accepted in a democratic system.\n\nThe bill was summarily defeated, but the government pushed at least two other similar bills, including one that proposed death penalty for online speech, that were defeated under the Bukola Saraki-led parliament.\n\nBut shortly after narrowly securing a second term, Buhari agreed with his aides that it was necessary to control social media, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nSeveral ways to ensure that the government\u2019s message dominated the public space with little to no pushback from citizens were suggested.\n\n\u201cIt was while the government was trying to find ways to control the media space that Adamu Garba\u2019s company was picked as one of the promising businesses that could proffer solutions,\u201d an administration official told People.\n\n\u201cThe seriousness of controlling social media cannot be overplayed.\u201d\n\nGarba earned instant name recognition in 2018 after showing interest in running for president against Buhari.\n\nHe summarily abandoned his campaign and became a recognisable voice in support of the president.\n\nThe regime provided hundreds of millions to Garba\u2019s firm in anticipation that its Crowwe platform would make a sufficient dent on the appeal of Facebook and Twitter, officials briefed on the matter said.\n\nBut two years after funding began and several months after Crowwe was introduced to the public, the app has not appealed to Nigerians on the scale expected by both the regime and its developers.\n\nOnly a few thousand users have signed up, and even then the app has been riddled with complaints around its functionality.\n\nAs part of efforts to give life to Crowwe, Garba sought to push Twitter out of Nigeria, filing a lawsuit against the platform in the wake of last October\u2019s historic #EndSARS campaign.\n\nMore than any other social media rivals, Garba saw Twitter\u2019s presence in Nigeria as an existential threat to his own platform and assumed its exit would push Nigerians to his own platform by default.\n\nBut his expectation was again dashed this month when his platform failed to pick up despite the government\u2019s ban on Twitter. Instead, Garba found his Crowwe app removed from Google Play Store a week after the Twitter ban following a deluge of complaints from users.\n\nHe said the app was taken down to upload, but failed to explain why it was only Crowwe that required being taken down before an update could be pushed to enhance user experience.\n\nThe app was largely unusable that Buhari, his administration officials and supporters had to move to Indian platform Koo following their exit from Twitter earlier this month.\n\nIn his reaction, Garba said, \"We do projects and receive payments from the Central Bank.

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "How technology is helping this AC technician scale his business",
          "text": "Have you ever walked into a room and immediately started sweating bullets? Have you spent time in a room with air-conditioners that blow hot air?\n\nThen you would quite understand why I was happy when last year, after a lot of convincing and back and forth, my mom finally agreed to get two air-conditioners installed in the house. But, unfortunately, it gets incredibly hot in the dry season even though there are huge windows everywhere. So we contacted a former neighbour that sells used ACs, paid three-quarters of the money, and had him deliver them to the house.\n\nAfter the delivery and installation by Udoka, a very cheerful and outspoken \u201cAC installer\u201d, trouble started. The ACs were not cooling. Udoka was called back several times, the gas was filled and refilled, one split AC exchanged for a standing one, a total of four technicians worked on the cooling units, one AC unit almost caught on fire.\n\nSeveral months later, my parents had spent more than \u20a6250,000 ($524.1)* on ACs that never worked. They are still in the house, an immutable reminder of wasted money and time, and perhaps, another reason to be continually disappointed in Nigerian artisans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s why when we were asked to pitch possible stories for an article, the event \u201cWorld Refrigeration Day\u201d caught my attention. I was increasingly interested when I saw that this year\u2019s theme was \u201cCooling Champions: Cool Careers for a Better World.\u201d\n\nI was immediately transported back to the emotions I felt during the AC installation and repair saga. But, rather than focus on my frustrations, I began to ask questions. What would it take to start a career in the refrigeration industry? How much would it cost? What kind of tools and technology make the work easier?\n\nWorld Refrigeration Day\n\nSince 2019, World Refrigeration Day is celebrated every June 26. It is an international awareness campaign established by the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat to raise the profile of the refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump sector. It focuses on the significant role that the industry and its technology play in modern life and society.\n\nIt was the idea of refrigeration consultant, Stephen Gill, former President of the Institute of Refrigeration in the UK. It quickly caught on in its first year, with more than 800 physical events held in 153 countries around the globe.\n\nAccording to the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat, more than 15 million people are employed worldwide in the refrigeration sector, while the total number of refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump systems in operation worldwide is around 5 billion.\n\nQuite impressive statistics, but I was curious about how much of it Nigeria\u2019s economy accounts for, especially for the average AC or refrigerator technician.\n\nI spent some time with Emmanuel to try to answer this, and you\u2019ll find details below.\n\nThe learning process\n\nEmmanuel of Ipese Oluwa Technologies\n\nEmmanuel is an AC technician who runs Ipese Oluwa Technologies, a business in the student town of Ile-Ife, Osun State. The young entrepreneur graduated from the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, as a Physicist in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like many OAU alumni before him, he saw a problem and decided to solve it. Before leaving school, he was already working as a cable TV installer. However, customers began to ask if he could repair ACs. Seeing the business opportunity, he decided to learn.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has 78 approved and accredited Vocational Enterprises Institutions (VEIs), with the latest getting approval in 2019. However, only two teach Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Practice, with a two or three-year study option. Some of these institutions give scholarships in conjunction with partners, but the rest require payment.\n\nInterestingly, Emmanuel didn\u2019t go down this route. Instead, he chose to learn from technicians in Ile-Ife and Benin City, Edo State. In 2014, he undertook the course for one and a half years and paid roughly \u20a6170,000 ($1062.5)** to learn but claims to have understood the basics in two weeks.\n\nApart from the traditional training, Emmanuel uses YouTube and Google as additional learning tools. For him, they are even more helpful than the conventional training.\n\n\u201cI learn so many things. I watch clips with different styles. It is very helpful,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter watching several hours of AC installation and work tools videos on YouTube myself, I am inclined to agree. But, interestingly, Nigerians are yet to join the DIY video trend.\n\nTools of the trade\n\nSource: United National Environment Programme (UNEP)\n\nAn AC technician requires several important tools to get his work done \u2014 wrenches, pipe bending tools, manifold gauge, pliers, a pen and paper, protective equipment, and so on.\n\nFor Emmanuel, though, certain tools that would make his work easier include a vacuum pump, a drill and a Hi-Lift Jack. A vacuum pump is an essential tool used to repair cooling units to clean the compressor by removing unwanted air and water vapour.\n\nA drill is used to puncture the wall for the AC\u2019s pipes and wall brackets. A handheld drill would be a step up from the chisel and hammer Emmanuel currently uses. The videos I watched showed how technicians use it to create very clean-cut holes \u2014 a far cry from the ragged holes crude tools form.\n\nThis is important because, apart from aesthetics, you don\u2019t want air leaking out from spaces in the room.\n\nWhen it comes to quotes, he gives prices based on the type of building where the cooling unit is to be installed. This is because it takes a lot of effort to move the AC up the house using a ladder, a situation that can be avoided by using a lift that guarantees a safe and hassle-free operation.\n\nAll of these cost quite a bit of money. But these are not the only tools Emmanuel employs.\n\nLeveraging the Internet\n\nThe AC technician reveals that he uses websites like Jiji and Facebook for advertising his products and services.\n\nAccording to him, he has received referrals from those ads.\n\nI find this quite interesting because while searching Google for a cooling technician in the Ile-Ife area, his was the only name that immediately came up. Others were located in Osogbo (1 hour 22 minutes away), Ibadan (1 hour 29 minutes away), and Lagos (3 hours 53 minutes away).\n\nI would later to find others, but that involved a search on Instagram, Google, Olist and Facebook.\n\nAir-conditioning units\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nInevitably, our discussion veered into types of ACs, the most popular, and the best ones to use.\n\nIn Nigeria, the climate is tropical, semi-arid in the far north, and progressively rainier as you move southward. In the north, the temperatures become extreme depending on the season. When it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s scorching. When it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing.\n\nThe south has more temperate weather, but the country is quite hot. A fact most Nigerians can attest to.\n\nPresently, the market for single-split air-conditioners in Nigeria is set at approximately 560,000 units annually. LG leads the pack with an 11% market share, Samsung has 9%, Panasonic and Midea have 8%, Gree and Chigo have 7%, Daikin 5%, while Haier Thermocool and Hisense have 3%. The remaining market share belongs to lesser-known brands like Royal.\n\n86% of these cooling units are assembled in the country, with 14% of them imported. This is because, unlike the automotive sector, for example, Nigeria encourages local assembly of the cooling units by setting a lower import duty (5%) for completely knocked down units, compared to assembled units (20%)\n\nEmmanuel says most customers prefer to buy new units with brands like Hisense, Royal, and Midea as the most patronised due to their relative cheapness. Prices range from the \u20a6100,000s ($243.01) to the \u20a6500,000s ($1215.07). However, he resisted my pressure and declined to name the best brand.\n\n\u201cWhat might be my best might be different for you,\u201d he said.\n\nI certainly wished we had decided to buy new ACs right then.\n\nCool careers for a better world\n\nAccording to Numbeo, the average monthly net salary in Nigeria is \u20a671,945.53 ($174.84).\n\nWhen asked if he would be willing to switch jobs, Emmanuel said no. According to him, he earns more money working as an artisan than most salary earners. So in one sitting, he could make more than most people.\n\nMoney aside, he views his work with enthusiasm. His eagerness to answer questions and willingness to learn things that he previously did not know, and his dedication to attempting his best work, all shine through as we converse.\n\nHappy World Refrigeration Day as we all take a moment to appreciate the cooling technicians who keep our homes and work areas cool and serene enough for comfortable living.\n\nWe should also appreciate the man who invented the modern air-conditioner, Willis Carrier.\n\n*Black market rates, December 2020\n\n**Dollar equivalent in 2014",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "A Nigerian Secondary School to start accepting cryptocurrency\n\nNew Oxford Science Academy, a private secondary school in Kano State, Nigeria, has announced it will be accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payments for school fees despite the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) banning financial institutions from providing cryptocurrency-related services.\n\nAccording to a report from Kano Focus, a news outlet in the state, the proprietor of the school, Sabi\u2019u Musa Haruna, will allow students to pay their tuition fees in cryptocurrency. The Proprietor said this while addressing journalists in Kano, stating that the school management took the decision after consulting parents and guardians. He urged the Nigerian government to embrace and regulate cryptocurrency in the interview.\n\nRead Also: What makes Nigeria the No.2 Cryptocurrency Market?\n\nSabi\u2019u Musa Haruna stated, \u201cWe have decided to accept cryptocurrency as school fees because the world today is tilting towards the system. We believe one day; digital money will gain more acceptance than paper money.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the decision was aimed at easing the strain of payment of school fees for parents, citing that countries like El Salvador and Tanzania had expanded payment options for cryptocurrency users. He did not give specifics as to which tokens the school will accept for payment, however.\n\nNDDC Forensic Audit Report ready by July\n\nThe NDDC has been plagued by a series of scandals which has seen the removal of the acting managing director, Daniel Pondei and approval of an interim administrator for the commission, Effiong Okon Akwa.\n\nAt the House of Reps investigative panel set up to probe the corruption allegations against Akpabio and members of the Interim Management Committee of the NDDC last year, Godswill Akpabio, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, accused members of the National Assembly of being the beneficiaries of most of the contracts from the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\nGodswill Akpabio has therefore stated that the final forensic audit report of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will be ready by July. The Minister disclosed this in an interview with State House correspondents on Tuesday, at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, according to a report by the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nThe forensic audit of NDDC is on course and it is progressing very well and I am happy with the progress made so far. And I am very certain that by the end of July, which is just a month and a few weeks away, the final result will be given to the president for implementation.\n\nAnd in terms of the composition of the board of the NDDC, of course, we have fast-tracked the process and the National Assembly will soon get the list.\n\nJAMB suspends the use of USSD code to check UTME results and gives new instructions\n\nIn the coming week, \u2018JAMBITES\u2019 would be expected to visit JAMB\u2019s website to access their results. The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) announced the suspension of the use of the USSD code to check the just-released results of the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).\n\nRead Also: UTME results: JAMB suspends USSD code, redirects candidates\n\nThis is as a result of the current challenges being experienced with the use of the USSD code by the candidates.\n\nThis was made known by JAMB in a statement issued by the Spokesman of the Board, Dr Fabian Benjamin, on Saturday, June 26, 2021.\n\nThe statement from Benjamin reads, \u201cIt has come to the attention of the Board that the result checking on USSD code 55019 is saddled with some challenges. Consequently, the Board hereby directs all candidates to visit JAMB portal to check for their 2021 UTME result.\n\n\u201cCandidates can check their results from anywhere there is internet access, checking by USSD code 55019 is suspended.\u201d\n\nDangote Fertilizer to begin export to US and Brazil in the coming week\n\nDangote Group has concluded plans to begin the export of its first shipment of fertilizer from its new fertilizer plant at the Lekki Free Zone in Lagos, to the US and Brazil. Initial shipment from one of the world\u2019s biggest fertilizer plant, which has the capacity to produce 3 million tonnes of urea and ammonia per year, is expected to start in late June or early July.\n\nThe billionaire chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, said this while speaking at a virtual economic forum hosted in Qatar on Tuesday, June 22, 2021, according to Reuters.\n\nAliko Dangote said that the new fertilizer plant will export its first shipment in late June or early July, to Louisiana, while the majority of exports from the plant are expected to go to Brazil, adding that it will also be able to supply all the major markets in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHe said, \u201cApart from meeting the domestic demand, we are going to be able to earn quite a lot of money exporting the goods to the South American countries.\u201d\n\nA lot of Nigerians believe that the fertilizer plant will help solve the problem of low crop yield in the country, which is partly due to insufficient access to fertilizer.\n\nCan anything halt this oil price Rally?\n\nOil prices were up on Monday, driven by the prospect of strong demand during the summer driving season and a pause in talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal that could indicate a delay in the supply of Iranian oil to the market.\n\nAccording to two OPEC+ sources on Tuesday, the organization is considering a gradual increase in supply from August, but no decision has been made yet on the actual volumes.\n\nOil prices gained for the third consecutive session on Friday, as demand growth is expected to outstrip supply on the prospect that OPEC+ producers will be cautious in returning more output to the market from August. Brent had a weekly growth of 3.91%.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish on signs of demand growth.\n\nGold rises amidst personal consumption expenditure data\n\nGold was bullish on Saturday as investors digested mixed signals from U.S. Federal Reserve officials on interest rate hikes earlier last week and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data released on Saturday.\n\nA key measure of U.S. inflation rose sharply again in May and showed prices rising at the fastest annual pace since 2008, which means that consumers will pay more for goods and services over the summer as the economy recovers from the pandemic.\n\nThe PCE prices index climbed 0.4% in May to mark a third straight big increase. Economists polled by Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal had a forecast of +0.5%. Over the past year, consumer prices have shot up 3.9%, reflecting the biggest gain since 2008 when oil prices hit a record high of $150 a barrel.\n\nWith the increase in the PCE index, senior officials of the Federal Reserve (FED) have downplayed the increase. Fed leaders insist prices will ease next year as the economy returns to normal, most people go back to work and widespread shortages of labour and supplies fade away.\n\nThe core PCE price index moved up 0.5% in May. That nudged the increase over the past 12 months to 3.4% from 3.1%. Although, the PCE is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President, Joe Biden reached a deal with a bipartisan group of senators to provide $579 billion in infrastructure investments, which also boosted investor sentiment on the yellow metal.\n\nOn the data front, 411,000 filed for initial jobless claims in the U.S. during the previous week as the labour market is steadily rebounding from COVID-19, thanks to a reopening economy. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted 380,000 claims but the actual was greater than the forecast by 31,000.\n\nOn Friday, the Bank of England handed down its policy decision. The central bank said inflation would exceed 3% in the coming months, but expected that the surge would be transitory and would not impact the current stimulus policy. Gold appreciated by 0.37% while Silver also inched up by 0.23% W-o-W\n\nOutlook\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, as the dollar continues to pressure the bullion.\n\nNBS economic data release calendar for the week\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\nMonday 28 th June 2021: Internally Generated Revenue at State Level (2020)\n\nJune 2021: Internally Generated Revenue at State Level (2020) Wednesday 30th June 2021: Prison Statistics (2020)\n\nCurrency market outlook\n\nThe currency market returned to its bearish trend this week both at the official window and unofficial market.\n\nIt depreciated against the US dollar, British Pound and Euro by -2.06%, -0.42%, -0.33%respectively closing at $1/N495, \u00a31/N718 and \u20ac1/N605 at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira depreciated week-on-week by +0.16% and +0.19% at the NAFEX window. The Naira closed the week at $/N411.67 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.\n\nOutlook\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney market outlook\n\nFinancial system liquidity opened the previous week at N75.53bn which pushed funding rates lower at the start of the week.\n\nAt the close of the trading session this week, funding rates rose. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 22.00% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 23.00% indicating a Week-on-Week (W-o-W) rise of +17.33% for OBB and +19.48% for O/N rates.\n\nOutlook\n\nFunding rates are expected to trend in double digits in the coming week.\n\nTreasury bills market outlook\n\nThe Treasury Bills Market started last week on a quiet note and a similar sentiment was sustained till the close of the week. However, the market was bearish at the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T.bills rose significantly by +8.59% to 6.90% while OMO bills rose by +0.81% W-o-W to close at 9.74%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill rose significantly by +6.12%.\n\nOutlook\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond markets outlook\n\nThe Bond market started the previous week on a relatively quiet note as market participants traded on a cautious basis ahead of the Bond auction mid-week.\n\nAt the close of the week, the overall market was bullish with buying interest seen across the board. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.83% for the week which fell W-o-W by -0.41%.\n\nSuccessful bids for the 16.2884% FGN MAR 2027, 12.5000% FGN MAR 2035 & 12.98% FGN MAR 2050 were allotted at the Marginal Rates of 12.7400%, 13.5000%, and 13.7000%, respectively.\n\nHowever, the original coupon rates of 16.2884% for the 16.2884% FGN MAR 2027, 12.5000% for the 12.5000% FGN MAR 2035, and 12.9800% for the 12.9800% FGN MAR 2050 was maintained.\n\nThe Eurobond market started the previous week on a relatively weak note as sentiment remains soft given the change in policy stance by the US FED. Selling was seen across the board particularly on the mid to long end of the curve.\n\nOutlook\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian capital market outlook\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the previous week on a negative note with a decline of -2.56%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N516.32bn thus, year-to-date return moderated to -6.49%, while the market capitalization settled at N19.6 trillion.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was mixed this week as the NSEAFRHDYI was the highest gainer for the week with +1.71% while NSE-IND recorded the highest decline with -3.33%. NSE Consumer Goods, NSE Banking, and NSE-Oil and Gas closed the week positive with +0.57%, +0.92%, and +0.12% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 24 gainers led by HONYFLOUR as against 10 losers led by NPFMCRFBK.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains, however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nThe movement of yields in the fixed income market could also influence the movement in the market.\n\nThe Nigerian economy in retrospect\n\nThe Federal Government on Thursday said it was investing $1bn on the construction of three flagship projects namely: the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge, and Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\nThe Minister of State for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu who disclosed this at an event earlier in the week, added that over N15tn would be required to bridge the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit.\n\nMinister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo announced on Thursday that the Federal Government has paid the sum of N24.8 billion as stipends to 413,630 beneficiaries under the Special Public Works Programme. According to the Minister, the scheme which enlisted a total of 774000 beneficiaries each of whom would get N60,000 each, is meant to reflate the economy especially as all Local Government Areas will benefit.\n\nAccording to data from NBS, domestic debt accounted for 62.33% of Nigeria\u2019s public debt portfolio as of Q1 2021. The domestic debt portfolio accounted for N20.64trn out of the total public debt stock of N33trn, while external debt was N12.47trn. Meanwhile, further disaggregation of Nigeria\u2019s domestic public debt showed that the Federal Government\u2019s domestic debt stock was put at N16.51trn while the domestic debt of States and FCT domestic debt stock was given as N4.12trn.\n\nThe World Bank has said Nigeria can mobilize revenue of up to N600bn annually by increasing \u2018sin taxes\u2019 especially the excise duties on tobacco and alcohol just as recommended in the Multilateral Organisation\u2019s \u2018Resilience through Reform\u2019 report. According to a senior official of the bank, Nigeria\u2019s excise duty rates on tobacco and alcohol are one of the lowest in Africa and a rise in the excise duty on such items would not impact most of the population.\n\nThe minister of finance, Budget, and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed declared on Wednesday that Nigeria planned to take more loans to fund infrastructure. Ahmed mentioned that the country was grappling with constrained revenue and as such needed to borrow more.\n\nThe minister argued that the debt-to-GDP ratio at 29 % allowed for more debt. Meanwhile, the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, differed on the nation\u2019s debt-to-gross Domestic Product ratio saying that the debt to GDP ratio had risen to 35 percent.\n\nOil dealers in Nigeria under the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Suleja/Abuja Unit started a strike on Monday following disagreements between it and the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR). The IPMAN said it was against the DPR\u2019s request for daily stock of products supplied by the dealers patronizing the Suleja depot in Niger State, describing it as unethical. The Head, Public Affairs, DPR, Paul Osu, argued that the request was a statutory regulatory requirement for a licensed retail outlet, which enables DPR to provide accurate petroleum products consumption data for the country.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a two-day National LPG sensitization and awareness campaign in Abuja on Tuesday, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo said effective implementation of the National LPG Expansion Plan (NLEIP) would move Nigerians away from using cooking fuel that is harmful to health and the environment to cleaner and more efficient energy. The FG noted its plan to upscale the 5 percent LPG domestic usage to 90 percent in 10 years.\n\nThe minister of state for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, during the shareholder\u2019s agreement on the construction of Brass Petroleum Products Terminal Limited (BPPT) on Tuesday, noted that residents of riverine areas had perpetually bought refined petroleum products at exorbitant prices because of the huge cost of transporting products to those locations. He believed BPPT limited located at Okpoama, Brass Local Government Area, Bayelsa State, will resolve these problems for the region.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Wednesday said it was collaborating with law enforcement agencies and other relevant downstream and upstream stakeholders to curb the menace of petroleum products smuggling and crude oil theft",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has unveiled plans for the Benin City Cultural District, which will house the Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA).\n\nObaseki disclosed this at the 2021 National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) Retreat for management staff and curators held in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor said an international town planning group is in the state undertaking Urban and Regional planning of Edo, which will redesign Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn this plan, we have included the carving out of a large area as a Cultural District and the Museum will be located in the Cultural District. If we host 5,000 visitors every year as a result of the attraction to the Museum, the state will benefit from it.\n\nWe are already working on this and have put up an Urban renewal plan for this purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cEMOWAA will be part of the national museum complex and the home for the comprehensive display of the Benin Art collection across the world. The artworks are global works and represent Africa, Nigeria and Edo globally; we should not lose them. We insist on the return of these artifacts to their original home, Benin City.\n\n\u201cWe should build something that is iconic and represents the extent of the prowess of the Benin empire. EMOWAA must be a research institution as there is a lot more to research and find out about the Benin Empire. There will be several important buildings in the museum complex and the museum will be a complex that will deal with the different aspects of the cultural life of Edo people.\u201d\n\nObaseki said culture is one of the viable platforms to leapfrog the state\u2019s development moving into the future, noting, \u201cCulture is a plank for the regeneration of our people.\n\n\u201cThe state government in collaboration with the Federal Government and the Royal Palace are in conversation on the return of the Benin artifacts sited in museums and collections across the world.\u201d\n\nObaseki thanked the British Government and the British Museum for alerting that there might be more works to be retrieved and also for the grant provided to undertake archaeological surveys and research to find the works that currently exist in Edo State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI assure you that by working with other European Governments, we have reached an advanced stage in getting the resources to start the first phase of preparing for the return and acceptance of these works. We are going to commence the construction of the pavilion where the returned works will be stored in the city center.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA), which is a complex and will be made up of several pieces will include the pavilion, the National Museum, Royal collections, Urhokpota Hall, restoration of a part of the Benin Moat, all of which will make visitors have the full experience of the Benin culture that span for more than six to seven centuries.\n\n\u201cThis is a training point for us as a state as we build a museum where the world will come and see original pieces which used to adorn European museums. This is a great project, which we look forward to.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended the creation of the Digital Benin project, which is a project documenting all works taken out of this city in every private or public museum globally.\n\nThe Director General of NCMM, Prof. Abba Isa Tijani, commended the governor for his love, determination, courage and commitment in ensuring the return of the artifacts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have 52 museums across the country and 65 monuments and sites. The issue of training and retraining is really a big problem for us in the commission.\n\n\u201cWhen I took over, I said the best way is to partner with the private sector and our partners outside the country. They have been able to now come to our aid in terms of capacity building.\n\n\u201cThe Edo Museum of West African Arts (EMOWAA) is a big opportunity for us to be at the forefront of promoting and establishing this museum. We have curators who are experienced; they just need slight training at the international level so that the standard that we want to set up at the EMOWAA will be maintained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Matt Hancock resigned as Britain\u2019s Health Secretary Saturday, one day after he apologized for breaching COVID-19 regulations.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe married politician was pictured kissing and embracing his adviser, with whom British tabloid The Sun alleged he is having an affair. The newspaper reported that the images were from May 6, two weeks before cross-household contact was allowed indoors in England.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to see the Prime Minister to resign as Secretary of State for Health and Social care. Those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve got to resign,\u201d Hancock said in a video posted on his Twitter page.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve done to protect the NHS at the peak, to deliver that vaccine rollout -one of the fastest in the world and I look forward to supporting the government and the Prime Minister from the backbenches,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he apologized writing, \u201cI want to reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance and apologise to my family and loved ones for putting them through this.\u201d\n\nThe Sun\u2019s report had sparked accusations of apparent cronyism, an allegation that the health secretary has faced previously for awarding a contract to a former neighbor for COVID-19 test kits.\n\nHancock has been under pressure for months over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Britain, but had managed to cling onto his role.\n\nHe was accused by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings of botching the country\u2019s coronavirus testing program, as well as lying about the dire situation in care homes and the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Hancock has denied the claims.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo date, more than 128,000 people have died in the United Kingdom from COVID-19 \u2013 the highest death toll in Europe. One of the biggest early failures of the UK\u2019s response to COVID-19 was in building a test-and-trace system. The British government has also been criticized for neglecting care homes, allowing many facilities to go without sufficient PPE, testing and clear guidelines.\n\nCummings delivered a damning account of the government\u2019s coronavirus response in a marathon seven-hour hearing before members of parliament in Westminster last month, accusing Downing Street and Hancock of misleading the British public.\n\nThe divisive figure, who quit his post last November amid the UK\u2019s deadly second wave of the pandemic, doubled down on his criticisms of Hancock last week.\n\n\u201cAs the PM said himself, Hancock\u2019s performance on testing, procurement, PPE [personal protective equipment], care homes etc was \u2018totally hopeless,\u2019\u201d Cummings said in a tweet, sharing a screenshot of what appears to be a WhatsApp exchange with Johnson just days after the UK went into its first full lockdown amid a worsening outbreak.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the same day that Johnson and Hancock both tested positive for the coronavirus, Cummings said he texted the prime minister to tell him the pace of coronavirus testing was too slow and that the health minister had misled government about his ability to speed it up.\n\nIn another text message a month later, on April 27, when National Health Service staff were running out of critical masks and gowns, Johnson said the PPE shortages were \u201ca disaster,\u201d and suggested taking Hancock off procurement of the equipment entirely.\n\nAsked last week by Sky News whether he was indeed hopeless, Hancock said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Johnson has not commented on the WhatsApp messages, and his official spokesman said the Prime Minister does not plan to engage with every allegation that is made.\n\nThe chaos around Hancock had already reached such a scale that it even drew the attention of the Queen.\n\nThe Queen alluded to the health secretary\u2019s woes on Wednesday in her first in-person audience with the prime minister in 15 months, informing Johnson that she had been speaking to \u201cyour secretary of state for health, poor man.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the comment was a reaction to the heavy burden of managing the country\u2019s coronavirus response, or an acknowledgment of the criticism Hancock has received from Cummings.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "title": "Opinion: In Support Of Ban On Open Grazing In Southern Nigeria \u2013 By SUNDAY EZE",
          "text": "Open grazing of cattle is a grave source of conflict between farmers and the herders throughout the country. The rate at which the clashes regularly occur is very alarming and indeed unsettling. This ever rising conflict has become a notorious national tragedy which has failed to draw the deserved urgent attention of those in authority. Many local farmers and herders alike have lost their lives while crops worth millions of Naira have gone down the drain as a result. Therefore, the expediency of banning cattle grazing openly in Southern Nigeria cannot be overemphasised. It was reported by International Crisis Group that; \u201cthe surge of attacks and counter-attacks has exacted heavy humanitarian and economic tolls, with potentially serious political and security repercussions. The humanitarian impact is particularly grave. From September 2017 through June 2018, farmer-herder violence left at least 1,500 people dead, many more wounded and about 300,000 displaced \u2013 an estimated 176,000 in Benue, about 100,000 in Nasarawa, over 100,000 in Plateau, about 19,000 in Taraba and an unknown number in Adamawa.\u201d The major factor feulling the killings according to group are also; \u201cclimate-induced degradation of pasture and increasing violence in the country\u2019s far north, which have forced herders south; the expansion of farms and settlements that swallow up grazing reserves and block traditional migration routes; and the damage to farmers\u2019 crops wrought by herders\u2019 indiscriminate grazing.\u201d According to Amnesty International, \u201cthe Nigerian authorities\u2019 failure to investigate communal clashes and bring perpetrators to justice has fuelled a bloody escalation in the conflict between farmers and herders across the country, resulting in at least 3,641 deaths in the past three years and the displacement of thousands more. In a new report, \u201cHarvest of Death: Three Years of Bloody Clashes Between Farmers and Herders\u201d, Amnesty International found that 57 per cent of the 3,641 recorded deaths occurred in 2018. Security forces were often positioned close to the attacks, which lasted hours and sometimes days, yet were slow to act. In some cases, security forces had prior warning of an imminent raid but did nothing to stop or prevent the killings, looting and burning of homes.\u201d The losses in both human and material resources and the dangers it poses to greater peace, unity and corporate existence of Nigeria should have been a reason for government to take drastic measures aimed at peace building and ensuring return to normalcy. Apart from banditry, kidnapping, Boko Haram, the killings and arson carried out by unknown gun men, there is no state in Nigeria at the moment not contending with one farmers/herders crisis or the other. The conflicts have overwhelmed many state governments. As a result, they frquently run to the federal government at the centre for help and in turn come back downcast and empty handed. The governors are the supposed chief security officers of their states but it is only effective on paper. Commisioners of police and other heads of security agencies do not take instructions from them. The rising frustration in safeguarding the lives and properties of citizens in the states is glaring and disturbing too. Citizens now see their governors as accomplices to their daily insurmountable tragedy.\n\nThere is an indication that the federal government is working at cross purposes with the states on finding a lasting solution to the issue of farmers/herders clashes. While all the Southern State Governors rose from a meeting in Asaba recently and declared total ban on open grazing in the entire region, the federal government is insisting on providing grazing routes for the cattle. A statements from Garba Shehu \u2013 the Senior Special Adiviser to the president on media claiming that; \u201cthe southern governors\u2019 proposed plan to enforce the ban on open grazing is of \u201cquestionable legality\u201d and a show of power,\u201d was a pointer to the federal government\u2019s position. Also, with the recent directive of President Buhari to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the federation Abubakar Malami to dig out gazzettes on grazing routes; it is clear that government\u2019s position is an invitation to anarchy. While many have rightly asserted that the Land Use Act of 1978 has rendered the Grazing Reserve Law of 1965 promulgated for the Northern Nigeria ineffective or completely dead; it is yet to be understood how the federal government which has no legal right to matters related to land administration will force its policies down the throats of state governments. From 2015 \u2013 date, the number of deaths related to farmers/herders conflict has proved to be alarming and on the increase too. Therefore, every right thinking, peace-loving individual and government should embrace the ban on open grazing and buy in to ranching. There is no gain repeating the fact that ranching and sedentary tendering of cattles and other animals are more healthier and productive all over the world. It is also less cumbersome for the herders. Basic amenities like schools, hospitals, houses, water and electricity are made available which are a far cry from what is obtainable in the bushes. It then beggars reason why, some people including a federal arm of government should support an archaic tradition of animal husbandry. This was even when it was obviously identified as a source of internal conflagration. It is most baffling that those who champion the sustenance of open grazing are living in choice cities enjoying the good things life could offer with their families while they deviously encourage others to live in the bush, trek and accompany cows from Sokoto to Bayelsa and back in the name of a traditional farming culture. Some of them have recently asked government to provide alternative to open grazing. One is at loss why a private business should ask the government for ideas or logistics on how to improve on and sustain its business. There are many known crops, fish and poultry farmers across the country. At no time did they pose any threat to their communities or compel government to do their bidding in order to sustain their personal businesses. Even if they do, they understood their roles and limitations to their demands. The question is why should it be only the cattle herders trying to box the entire nation into a corner to ensure their business flourishes against others? People have concluded that the federal government has in its body language given tacit support to the contentious activities of herders. Another vital point to note was that; many politicians and policy makers from all the regions own cows. Prohibiting their cows from roaming the streets will incurs heavy financial burden as it means denying them of free grasses, water etc.\n\nBut the interest of a few should not override that of the nation. They should not be allowed to perpetually put the country under undue pressure with their personal businesses. The right thing is right and should be done in the interest of peace. It is not enough to make an ordinary pronouncement and issue a communique at the end of a meeting. The collective decision of all the southern state governors should be backed up by an Act of the State Houses of Assembly. A state like Ekiti has an existing Anti-Open Grazing Act before 2015 while Abia and Bayelsa recently took a cue from Ekiti. Others states should make haste and follow suit by sending an anti-open grazing bill to their various state houses of assembly. Moreover, for states home and dry with anti open grazing law, the beauty of every law is a reflection of its effective implementation. Our country do not make the desired progress on account of the fact that politics, religion, tribalism and ethnicity are deliberately injected into every national policies and issues. One is constrained to disagree with positions and unwarranted claims that calls to end open grazing is an attack on the traditional animal husbandry culture of the north and means of livelihoods of the herders. The two Miyetti Allah organisations (Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Aaaociation and Miyetti Alalh Katul Kore) should for once tell the herders the truth. Southern state governors should also take a deliberate step further by enlightening the herders on the rewards for an end to open grazing. Nobody takes pride in suffering. The herders too won\u2019t. Every well meaning and peace loving Nigerian should queue behind the decision of the southern state governors on banning open grazing. This is the only route to the return of lasting peace between farmers/herders conflicts in Nigeria.\n\nSunday Onyemaechi Eze, a Media and Communication Specialist is the publisher: thenewinsightng.blogspot.com.

          "text": "By Nimot Sulaimon\n\nBuhari Media Organisation says that only hypocrites will condemn the Kano-Maradi rail but keep mute over the Enugu-Bamenda highway.\n\nAs the motivation and philosophy behind the Kano- Maradi rail project are the same as that of the 403-kilometre highway linking Enugu to Bamenda in Cameroon.\n\nAccording to the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) in a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, it would be sheer hypocrisy for anyone to condemn the rail project but remain silent on the highway project in the South.\n\n\u201cWe find it strange that many people, including opposition elements who saw everything wrong with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval of a rail project linking three States in Northern Nigeria to a border town in the Niger Republic, are unusually silent about the government\u2019s decision to stick with the 2007 agreement with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Cameroon.\n\n\u201cBut for us, the same economic factors that the Buhari administration took into consideration in committing itself to the $1.96bn standard gauge rail project are not different from the decision to link one of the major cities in Southern Nigeria to a city in Cameroon.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the 387-km railway line is to run through Kano, Jigawa and Katsina States which are significant trade hubs with massive markets including Dawanau which is believed to have an annual trade volume of $2.5bn, to Maradi which is the major transport and agriculture hub of Niger\u2019s south-central region. \u201cIt is also important to note that 11 out of the 12 stations on the route are in Nigeria with the terminal point at the border town of Maradi which is 622 kilometres from Niamey, the capital of Niger while the highway into Cameroon will terminate within 300 kilometres of Yaounde, the capital city. \u201cThe Enugu to Bamenda highway will drive a lot of economic activities in several Nigerian communities in the South, up to the border with Cameroon, but it is only the rail project that has the potential of opening up a vibrant export route into our landlocked neighbours, especially as it is to be linked to the Lagos-Kano rail line which already has an extension to the Apapa Ports via the Lagos-Ibadan rail line.\n\n\u201cSo we make bold to affirm that the economic considerations for the two projects are similar and both will add a lot of value to commercial activities along the corridors\u201d.\n\nBMO also took a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which was critical of the Kano-Maradi rail project.\n\n\u201cOf all the criticisms that trailed the project, the one that many discerning Nigerians found hard to live with was that of PDP which through its media handlers described it as wasteful.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is the same party under the Goodluck Jonathan administration that conceived the idea of linking Nigeria to Niger and in fact had a more elaborate plan that would have began in Zaria, in Kaduna State and terminate in Niamey which is almost 700km from Maradi where the current project is ending.\n\n\u201cSo on President Buhari\u2019s watch, Nigeria is making considerable investments on two major cross-border infrastructure projects and the administration deserves credit for remaining committed to actualising them even if it did not originally conceive them.\n\n\u201cAnd as the President said in one of his recent TV interviews, it\u2019s all about economics though some sceptics opted to ignore his justification of the Kano-Maradi project\u201d.\n\nBMO reassured Nigerians that the President will keep to the terms of his vow to improve on the country\u2019s infrastructure, regardless of dwindling oil revenue.",

          "text": "\u2026Farmers unable to go to farms due to banditry \u2013 el-Rufa\u2019i \u2026Food calamity looms unless\u2026- CAN \u202612.83m citizens in crisis levels \u2013 FOA, ActionAid \u2026We\u2019re finding it difficult to cope \u2013 Nigerians \u2026Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re combing bandits\u2019 hideouts \u2013 Military\n\nThe increasing security concerns in Nigeria especially in the North have made it difficult for farmers to go to their farms as they fear being attacked and have consequently fled their communities. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the effects of the ugly security situation on food production and availability.\n\nNigeria is currently facing security challenges in different areas; from the North-east that is ravaged by Boko Haram/Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP), the North-west distressed by armed bandits, the South-east disturbed by the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) secession group, and the North-central which is battling the age-long farmers,\u2019 herders\u2019 crises.\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s alarm\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i of Kaduna state recently said there is a looming food crisis as farmers are unable to go to their farms due to the activities of bandits.\n\nThe governor, who emphasised the role of the Department of State Services (DSS) in providing reliable information needed by the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of the insurgents, said, \u201cthere is urgent need by security agencies to strengthen intelligence gathering, to establish not just the identities, plans and locations of the criminals, but to actively disrupt their capacity to organise and mount attacks on the citizens.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the criminal gangs terrorising the North-west region have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015, after the joint operation of the states stopped.\n\n\u201cAs Directors of the State Commands of the DSS in the North-west, you are all aware of the immense security challenges across the states in our region. The consequences of these serious security deficits have devastated the rural economy, taken lives and property and made simple travel an ordeal across federal, state and local roads.\n\n\u201cThe governors of the North-west states and Niger state appreciated this salient fact as far back as 2015. We came together to fund simultaneous operations by the federal military and security agencies across the largely ungoverned Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes that straddle about seven of our states up to Dajin Rugu in Katsina state. These operations disrupted the cattle rustling gangs, but were unfortunately not sustained as a continuous exercise to dominate these spaces and assert within them the authority of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThat the criminal gangs have become more daring and dangerous since recovering from their near defeat in 2015 is obvious across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the lead agency for domestic intelligence and counter-intelligence, the Department of State Services has a vital role to play in providing the reliable information needed by the Police and Armed Forces and other security agencies for the total defeat of these dangerous insurgents.\n\n\u201cThis is an urgent priority, in the face of the looming food crisis that we face if our farmers do not go to the farms. The rains are here, but farmers in various communities are unable to go to their farms; that is when they are lucky not to have fled their remote villages under pressure and attacks from the criminals. This cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nCAN\u2019s concerns\n\nSimilarly, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the 19 Northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (Northern CAN), has noted that without mincing words, the current state of the nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its the public relations officer (PRO), Rev. Jechonia Albert, to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAccording to the statement, due to the prevailing economic and security challenges facing Nigerians, celebrating June 12 as a Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace; hence not worthy of celebration.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cJune 12, declared as Democracy Day by the current administration, was marked with mixed feelings across the country. Amid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially the in rural communities, have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided and people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as travelling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians. The rains are here, but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is a looming food crisis and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, we may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nFAO, ActionAid\u2019s alarms\n\nIn the same vein, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has raised the alarm over the worsening state of food security in the country. It, therefore, stressed the need for urgent measures to protect the most vulnerable, keep the national agricultural supply chains functional and efficient, and mitigate the food security impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFAO country representative Fred Kafero, who spoke at the 44th meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD), said the theme of the meeting, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Agriculture and Food Security in the Face of Covid-19, Floods and Insecurity,\u2019 was a call to action, to cushion threats to the livelihoods of a large section of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the March-April 2021 Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) food security analysis conducted in 16 states and the FCT projected that a total of 12.83 million people in the affected states would be in crisis levels.\n\nAlso, the ActionAid country director Ene Obi raised concerns over the inability of women to go to farms for fear of being raped. She said being the major producers of food in the country, it is important for the government to fast-track its efforts at curtailing the rising insecurity.\n\nShe decried low budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector despite the fact that Nigeria is a signatory to the Maputo Declaration on the allocation of a minimum of 10 per cent to the sector.\n\nNigerians\u2019 lamentations\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians who spoke with Blueprint Weekend have lamented the increase in prices of foodstuff. The high increase in the prices of food items has affected so many families as well as salary earners. Some of the civil servants who spoke with our reporter said they now find it difficult to cope with the skyrocketing increase in the prices of essential commodities.\n\nA civil servant told this reporter in confidence that, \u201cIt is like I am not working at all. I work with the Ministry of Labour and receive salary, but at the end of the month, I pay debts because I borrow weekly from friends to buy groceries for my family. How much is a mudu of beans? How much was it three months ago? That is what we are saying; it keeps increasing.\u201d\n\nAlso, Kabiru Abdullahi, a meat seller, blamed the increase in meat in the market on the rise of insecurity in some parts of the country, pointing out that a kilo of meat sold for 1, 500 three months ago is now 2, 500 to 3, 000 depending on the bargaining power of the customer.\n\n\u201cAnytime we go to the market, we come back with whatever we can afford. A cow that we used to buy for N300, 000 is now N600, 000, while that of 250,000 is now N500, 000 or even N450, 000.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commodities are not scarce, but the problem is going to the market to get them due to the security situation in some parts of the country. We can\u2019t go to states like Katsina and Sokoto where cows are cheap; we now source them Kano, Bauchi or Gombe state,\u201d he said.\n\nIsa Mohamed, a farmer from Anzare village in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna state whose village was sacked by bandits in February, described as \u201cunfortunate\u201d the soaring prices of foodstuff and lamented that they have been unable to farm grains due to the activities of bandits.\n\nA pepper trader, who identified herself as Bilkisu, said: \u201cThe cost of food is very expensive, especially pepper and tomatoes. Two years ago, a basket of tomatoes went for N4, 000, but now, it is N18, 000 or N17, 000. I can\u2019t afford a basket because of the hike. The money we used to buy a basket of pepper and tomatoes is what we now use to buy the items in smaller quantities. Also, a quarter bag of pepper is now N6, 500. We bought one bag of Shombo for N13, 000 yesterday. Today, I could not afford the price, and so I had to buy in bits from other traders.\n\nMilitary\u2019s assurances\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters said it had begun the bombardment of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the North-west, North-central and some parts of the North-east. It stated that operational efforts of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in various theatres of operations have led to the reduction in criminal activities across the country.\n\nThe director, Defence Media Operation (DMO), Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, stated this recently while briefing journalists on the operational activities of the AFN across the country between June 3 and 16, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cTroop\u2019s operational activities in Operation Hadarin Daji theatre of operation between June 3 and 16, 2021, were characterised with ambush operations, aggressive fighting patrols, air raids, sustained air intelligence surveillance reconnaissance patrols as well as cordon and search operations.\n\n\u201cThese operations yielded attendant successes in the period under review. Troops, during an ambush operation on June 3, intercepted and neutralised some gunrunners who were in possession of assorted arms and ammunition between Naimaimai Village and Sabon Birni Town in Sabon Birni local government area of Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on June 4, 2021, troops, following credible intelligence report, conducted cordon and search operation along Gurbin Baure \u2013 Jibia Road in Katsina state. During the operation, troops intercepted and neutralised some armed bandits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s stern order\n\nThe senior special assistant on media and publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had in an interview with the Hausa Service of the BBC in March, said President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered a crackdown on bandits terrorising farmers across the country.\n\nAlso, during his interview with Arise Television recently, the president said he had ordered security agents to shoot on sight bandits carrying AK-47 rifles.\n\nFood imports\n\nThe rise in agricultural imports has continued unabated due to insecurity despite many Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN\u2019s) initiatives aimed at achieving food sufficiency.\n\nA recent foreign trade report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that Nigeria\u2019s agricultural imports increased by 140 per cent in the first quarter of this year.\n\nNigeria imported agricultural items worth N630.18 billion in the period compared to N262.1 billion in first quarter of 2020.\n\nThis represents the highest quarterly agric import recorded by Nigeria since 2016. In the past two years, between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020, Nigeria has spent N3.1 trillion on agricultural imports.\n\nSome of the programmes, as stated by the apex bank in its last MPC briefing, include N631.4 billion to 3.11 million small-holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million hectares of land, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 program. Also, 29, 26 beneficiaries received N111.7 billion for the AGSMEIS, while 548,345 beneficiaries have received N253.4 billion under the Targeted Credit Facility.\n\nThese interventions notwithstanding, agric imports have continued to rise, triggered by multiple de-valuations of the naira; demand for higher input raw materials, and rising inflation. Much of Nigeria\u2019s food consumption still relies significantly on the importation of food items to stimulate local production.\n\nFor example, wheat remains an imported production input costing Nigeria about N222 billion in the first quarter of 2021 alone. It was N252 billion in the 4th quarter of 2020, translating to an annualised cost of N1 trillion ($2 billion). The country\u2019s food index has increased by 32.3 percent between September 2019 and April 2021 which is only a weighted aggregate of the market reality.\n\nAccording to a market survey report which studies the prices of food items in major markets in Lagos state, a bag of pepper surged by as much as 85.7 per cent in May 2021, while beans increased by 15.1 per cent in the same period. Other items that have witnessed significant increases recently include flour, egg, tomatoes, noodles, pasta, bread, beverages, just to state a few.\n\nFor Suleiman Dikwa, the CEO of Green Sahara Farms, a major cause of the surge in agric imports is the inability of the country to produce sufficiently for local consumption",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta has called on the States\u2019 House of Assembly to ensure that the Constitutional Amendment Bill is passed when passed to them by the National Assembly.\n\nOkowa made the call on Friday when he received the Conference of Speakers of States\u2019 Legislatures in Nigeria led by its Chairman and Speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Abubakar Suleiman, at Government House, Asaba.\n\nHe stated that as states\u2019 legislatures, the onus was on them to pass the Constitutional amendments in the interest of the nation.\n\nHe said that the nation was in dire need of the amendments to provide equity, justice and fairness in the affairs of the country.\n\nOkowa urged the Conference to continue to be a voice for the people and to remain true in enforcing executive-legislative relations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that the National Assembly is currently engaged in the review of the 1999 Constitution and when they are through, it will be passed over to the States\u2019 Assemblies for passage.\n\n\u201cThe management of the country has placed a key role in your hands and I urge you all to look at it passionately to ensure that we are fair, equitable and justiciable in all decisions we will take in passing the ammendment.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble but I believe that in working together, we can pilot the nation out of the current challenges through a passionate approach because as leaders, everything about governance must be in the overall interest of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the legislature in Delta for its cooperation which had led to the achievements recorded by his administration in the last six years.\n\nAccording to him, whatever we have achieved as a state so far is because we have a very robust relationship with the State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThey are very passionate about the development of the state and that has helped us to make lots of progress.\n\n\u201cI am glad that you have organised yourselves under the Conference to compare notes, just as the Governors, to discuss and share ideas and to also talk to ourselves because it helps to improve the bond of unity among the various states.\n\n\u201cThe more we are talking together and remain strong the better for our country and I believe that was why the Conference of Speakers was berthed and I hope that you will continue to use the conference to better the lots of this nation,\u201d he added.\n\nOkowa who underscored the importance of executive-legislative relations, said \u201cif any state is to make progress there is need for a very warm relationship with the executive and legislative arms to enable policies and programmes work more efficiently than they would have ordinarily had.\n\n\u201cWe are in very trying times and this poses more burden on the various state legislatures. There must be a lot of collaborations and thinking to get the states out of unemployment, poverty and insecurity pervading the nation.\n\n\u201cA very cordial relationship that works will help to improve on the development of our country.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, you have a lot of role to play and I charge you to see yourselves going beyond just making laws, to help the executive to ensure that the people get the best of governance.\n\n\u201cThe fear of legislative autonomy is unfounded because our state House of Assembly has been operating in autonomy since 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Rt. Hon. Suleiman had said that the Speakers were in the state for the second quarter meeting of the Conference.\n\nHe said that the Conference was made up of Speakers of the 36 States Houses of Assembly representing the 998 members of Houses of Assembly in the country.\n\nHe commended the Governor for the massive development in Asaba and parts of the state, adding that the mutual understanding between the Executive and Legislative arms of government in the state was commendable and worthy of emulation.\n\nSpeaker of Delta House of Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, Rt Hon.

That is why there is so much suffering in the world. Today, the Lord wants to repair all that is broken down. Only come back and reconnect to Him.\n\n\u201cYou will reconnect and your life will never remain the same. You can begin to think about the freedom, power and authority the angels enjoy, and God made it so that we can enjoy the good life He planned for us. The glory and honour are coming back. The Lord will cleanse and change you, and all you lost will be restored to you.\n\n\u201cHe also made all things: sickness, suffering, oppression, calamities, etc. to be under your feet. By divine connection, from tonight, there will be a restoration of all that God planned for you originally.\u201d\n\nThe former university don stressed that sin is the instrument used by the devil to influence people to do evil and achieve his aim of destroying human lives and all good things that would bring peace and development.\n\nHe added that sin is the spiritual challenge of man that generates physical and moral decays in the society, therefore appealed to Nigerians to connect with God, and the expected divine intervention individually, family, nationally, and socio-economically will come but through absolute repentance from all sin.\n\n\u201cYou can invite sin with one finger but at the end, ten fingers will not be enough to remove them. Many people commit sin today and they feel they are alright. We are saying tonight that when you are in sin, you are not alright.\n\n\u201cThe Lord is your Redeemer, He will save you from all troubles and problems. He knows where your goodness, prosperity, satisfaction and sufficient supplies are, and He will lead you to them as you connect to Him. After giving you all this goodness, in the end, He will take you to heaven.\n\n\u201cWhen God calls you to repentance, you have to come to Him and do away with all those things which cause disconnection, chief of which is sin\u201d, he said.",

          "title": "Deep Impact: How COVID-19 Exposed The Education Sector\u2019s Digital Flaw",
          "text": "Solomon Elusoji\n\nKemi Ogunsanya, 29, studied English Education at the University of Lagos. After graduation she wasn\u2019t inclined, at first, to teach. But after several failed job applications, she returned to the classroom, this time as an instructor. And, for seven years, she hasn\u2019t looked back.\n\nWhen Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Education ordered the closure of all schools to limit the spread of the pandemic in March 2020, Kemi\u2019s students \u2013 aged seven to 11 \u2013 were just about to commence examinations. \u201cIt was a bit destabilising,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we knew we were going to continue online.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s school made the transition to online learning using tools such as Zoom and Class Dojo. To \u201cthoroughly engage\u201d her students, she picked up skills in cartoon animation and visual design, and researched techniques on how to gamify learning. \u201cI wanted to captivate my students\u2019 attention,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that if it was boring, students would not enjoy it.\u201d\n\nOf course there were challenges \u2013 the regular limitations of Internet data and power supply. And since online learning requires a lot of parent participation, she had to keep constant tabs on parents to ensure student attendance and prompt submission of class assignments.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of effort, but it wasn\u2019t a wasted year,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cNow that schools have resumed, there are some slides and videos I created then that we are still using now. And the students still enjoy them.\u201d\n\nBut for millions of students enrolled in public or rural schools in Nigeria, the school closures halted formal learning, according to more than a dozen teachers who spoke to Channels Television. For months, students were cut off from their instructors. The use of digital technology to communicate was not an option as most children who attend public, rural schools come from poor homes with no access to smartphones or the Internet. The Ministry of Education in several states tried to reach students through mass produced radio and television programs, but the impact was minimal at best. \u201cTeaching did not stop,\u201d one teacher said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t tell if learning took place.\u201d\n\nAn unfair advantage\n\nAdaobi Amadi, 34, had always wanted to be a teacher. When she was younger, she had her own make-shift school, complete with a blackboard and chalk, where she taught her neighbours. So it wasn\u2019t a surprise when she took up teaching after graduating from the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Akwa, with a degree in Applied Biochemistry.\n\nToday, she teaches Chemistry to students between 13 and 18 at a public school in Port Harcourt.\n\nWhen schools were closed in March 2020, she thought, at first, it was going to be a one-month holiday. But the months continued to meld into one another and she began to feel an emotion she described as \u2018panic\u2019. While her son, who attends a private school, was receiving lectures online from home, she was cut off from her students. \u201cAt that point, it became kind of stressful,\u201d she said.\n\nAn online learning approach would never work for Adaobi\u2019s students. Most of them came from families with no access to smartphones or laptops, talk less of Internet data. \u201cIn my school, there are students who come to me and say, we haven\u2019t eaten since yesterday. Majority of them are domestic workers. We do have a sprinkling who come from middle-class homes, but those are very few.\u201d\n\nWhen schools began to reopen in the later part of 2020, Adaobi said \u201cthe drop in performance was glaring.\u201d Teachers tried to review what had been taught in the past months and holidays were shrunk. The Christmas break didn\u2019t extend much beyond a week, as efforts to gain ground intensified.\n\nAdaobi said school hours were also reduced from six to three hours as authorities moved to comply with social distancing regulations imposed by the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cPrivate schools have maintained their schooling schedules,\u201d she said. \u201cThey get like six hours of schooling. And my students get only three hours. And it\u2019s the same syllable they are supposed to cover and the same examinations they are supposed to sit for.\u201d\n\nShe observed that the questions in the last set of external exams her student wrote seemed to have been easier than previous ones. Perhaps, she mused, the examination bodies had considered the impact of the pandemic on student performance. (A WAEC spokesman told Channels Television the examination body \u201cwill never compromise on standards or integrity\u201d of its tests)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that will happen again,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams. Private school students not only got the online classes that they did, then when schools resumed they continued with their normal schedule. So they are prepared. But public school students are not.\u201d\n\nAn inadequate government response\n\nNigeria is not the only country where the pandemic disrupted education. According to UNICEF, about 1.2 billion learners were out of school and 73.8% of the world\u2019s school population were affected by school closures as a result of efforts to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nOn paper, the Federal Government developed several initiatives to ensure students continued to learn despite the pandemic lockdowns, through the Nigeria Education Sector COVID-19 Response Strategy set up by the Federal Ministry of Education and the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC).\n\nThe strategy included plans for the Learn at Home Programme (LHP), which led to partnerships with educational technology companies and the launching of virtual e-learning platforms.\n\nThese platforms include SchoolGate (for primary school students), Mobile Classroom, WAEC E-learning toolkit and Unity Schools virtual learning platforms.\n\nThe Ministry, on its website, also linked to other educational resources from Khan Academy, Seesaw, National Open University, UNESCO School Meets Learner Approach, Teacher Development Programme, British Council, and others.\n\nState Governments, too, adopted several initiatives. The Lagos State government, for example, partnered with First Bank of Nigeria to equip students with e-learning solutions and low-end devices preloaded with a government-accredited curriculum and designed to work offline.\n\nAlso, many states turned to broadcasting lessons on radio and television. These lessons encompassed content on core primary and secondary school subjects.\n\nBut what was the impact of these interventions? Were they able to meet the learning needs of students or mitigate the number of dropouts when schools eventually reopened, considering Nigeria has one of the largest numbers of out-of-school-children in the world?\n\nA Federal Ministry of Education spokesman Ben Bem Goong suggested that it was hardly the Ministry\u2019s responsibility to ensure active participation in digital learning.\n\n\u201cHaving access to online facilities is basically an individual responsibility,\u201d he said during a phone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t buy a phone and give it to anybody. I don\u2019t think the Ministry will buy phones and laptops (for students) to access online materials. We haven\u2019t gotten to that level.\u201d\n\nOne vision of the Ministry of Education is \u201cto provide universal and equal access to quality basic and secondary education that will ensure self-reliance, preparedness for further education, good citizenship and effective participation in democratic governance.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the Ministry was worried about the inability of many students, especially those attending public, rural schools, to access digital learning, including resources provided by the government, Mr Goong said the government cannot be expected to do everything.\n\n\u201cThe question you are asking me is not within the (purview) of the Federal Ministry of Education to answer, in the sense that providing Internet facilities is not just a function of what the Ministry of Education does alone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn terms of providing electricity \u2013 which is the key driver to rolling out online materials \u2013 it\u2019s not within our responsibility to do. This cuts across sectors. So when a student is unable to access online materials that are driven by electricity or wireless signals, it is not entirely a responsibility of the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cIt is a responsibility that cuts across Ministries, one that also has to do with the family. There is no way government can do all of that alone; if government has built schools, government has engaged teachers, it\u2019s paying them, maintaining the schools, I think some other stakeholders should also take that responsibility, particularly those that value education; they should be able to say how do I provide laptops and batteries for my children to learn. When you begin to put everything on the head of government, believe you me, even the best critics of governance will not like to be in government after one week.\u201d\n\nTo prepare for another pandemic-like school closure, Mr Goong said the Federal Ministry of Education was seeking to partner with the Nigeria Television Authority and the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria to develop lessons in key areas for broadcast, especially for students in exit classes.\n\nThe importance of digital tools\n\nSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna. He was excited to be starting his fellowship with Teach for Nigeria, a program which recruits talented future leaders and sends them to teach at schools in low-income communities.\n\nHe remembers being introduced to teachers who were invigilating a primary six examination. When he asked them how the students were doing, they appeared to mock the pupils. \u201cThese ones? They don\u2019t know anything,\u201d one of the teachers said, according to Onyeledo. \u201cIn fact, they can\u2019t even read the questions on the board. We just wrote it down in English language but we have to read it out in Hausa before they will be able to attempt it.\u201d\n\nFor most of the next two years, Onyeledo, a graduate of Geology from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, worked hard to teach a class of kids how to read.\n\n\u201cIf a child goes from primary one to primary six and still can\u2019t read,\u201d Onyeledo said, \u201c I think the school system has wasted six years of that child\u2019s life. Because a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy. Just the ability to read, to communicate in the English language.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic-induced school closures cut short Onyeledo\u2019s time with the kids.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was close to devastating, mainly because of the kids in my class,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cI had been working with them closely, trying to get them to learn to read, basically. I was teaching primary two. I started with them in primary one. That was then the pandemic happened. When schools closed, it was devastating because I knew how far we had gone. If I\u2019m not with them, they might just slide back.\u201d\n\nAnd he couldn\u2019t really be with them because most of the parents of the kids in his class didn\u2019t have smartphones. The only channel of communication was through voice calls, which he said were not effective enough and couldn\u2019t really scale. There were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that level, these children need hands-on-learning, they need guidance.\u201d\n\nWhen lockdown measures were eased, he tried to visit some of his students at home and share resources with their guidance, while observing Covid protocols. But he would always wish that his students had access to technology.\n\n\u201cWith tech, we would have held online classes on Zoom, easily created a classroom, a group for all the parents and kids,\u201d Onyeledo said. \u201cAnd sometimes send voice notes. For those who are visual learners too, we could send some resources, including videos. It would make your teaching very effective. With technology, it would have been a whole lot better.\u201d\n\nMaryam Onubaye, 27, was another Teach for Nigeria fellow in Kaduna who lost major contact with her pupils after schools closed. But she wouldn\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about ways to get them learning,\u201d she said \u201cSome of their parents have Whatsapp-enabled phones. So I went to their houses \u2013 the community where my school was \u2013 Tudun Wada \u2013 you can have like five families in one area and ten kids. I went to their houses and made lesson videos on the subjects I teach and every week I send them to their phones. I give exercises at the end of the videos that they can do. And I explain to parents how they can guide them and make sure they actually do the exercises. And they take a picture and send it back to me. We did that every week.\n\n\u201cThe ones who do not have Whatsapp-enabled phones, I had to do weekly exercises with them. Every weekend, I\u2019ll go and teach them a little, come back and follow up.\u201d\n\nHer enthusiasm and creativity and hard work made some impact, but Onubaye recognised the limitations. More \u201cdigital tools would have made a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for that to happen, there are so many things that need to happen. The kids have to have access to the internet, power, a tablet, a phone or a computer.\u201d For now, they do not.\n\n\u2018A lot of work to do\u2019\n\nIn March, internet penetration in Nigeria stood at 41 percent, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission. And coverage is mostly limited to urban cities such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja and Kano. But almost half of all Nigerians still live in rural communities, according to data from the World Bank. In 2020, the Federal Government launched a new national broadband plan which, by 2025, is expected to ensure all tertiary education institutions are within \u201c5km of fibre manhole or with a fixed connection\u201d to the Internet. Under the plan 50 per cent of secondary schools and 25 percent are expected to be covered by 2025. Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, which \u201cworks to connect underserved young Africans with digital opportunities\u201d, said the government\u2019s plan \u201cis very conservative\u201d and \u201cmay not even be achieved if the government continues to introduce contradictory policies.\u201d\n\nAnother obvious challenge is power supply. As of 2018, according to World Bank data, only 56.5 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population have access to electricity. And as tariffs continue to rise, the poor and their children may find it harder to afford the glow from light bulbs.\n\nThe national situation is exacerbated by rising insecurity. While the number of out-of-school-children in Nigeria has dropped to 6.9 million from 10.1 million, with the help of the Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) programme in Nigeria, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has noted that \u201cmore and more children are joining the queue.\u201d Between December and March 2020, over 600 students were kidnapped from schools across the country. \u201cStudent kidnappings threaten collapse of Nigerian education system,\u201d two scholars warned in April.\n\n\u201cGovernment has a lot of work to do,\u201d Zam Daniel, a teacher in Abuja, said. \u201cIn the education sector, we are about 50 years behind developed countries.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, Nigeria must work to democratise digital education.\n\n\u201cIf it is our right to be educated and the web is now the biggest source of information,\u201d Adetola Omolade, a teacher at Greensprings School in Lagos, said.\n\n\u201cthen I think access to the internet is a basic human right.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cBecause if it\u2019s the same standards as what we had three, four years ago, I\u2019m obviously scared for public school students.\n\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s very unfair that public school students and private school students would sit for the same exams.\nThe importance of digital toolsSamuel Onyeledo, 35, still remembers vividly the first day he walked into a public primary school in Kaduna.\nBecause a basic thing the child should get before leaving primary education is literacy.\nThere were radio programs, but he wasn\u2019t sold on their effectiveness for primary school students.",

          "text": "France was voting in the second round of regional elections on Sunday after a first round that saw a drubbing for President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s ruling party, disappointment for Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right and record low turnout.\n\nFor some observers, the outcome of the June 20 first round raised doubts over whether the 2022 presidential election would come down to a duel between Macron and Le Pen in a run-off long seen as the most likely scenario.\n\nThe first-round results marked a boost for the traditional right-wing The Republicans as well as the Socialist Party, who have been squeezed after the centrist Macron surged into power in 2017 with his brand-new Republic on the Move (LREM) party.\n\nAnalysts warn against too much extrapolation onto a nationwide scale from the results of the regional elections, which choose the heads of France\u2019s 13 mainland regions from Brittany in the northwest to the Provence-Alpes-Cote d\u2019Azur (PACA) region in the southeast.\n\nBut there was cross-party concern over the turnout for last week\u2019s polls, which were shunned by 66.72 percent of voters \u2014 a record in modern France.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is the culmination of a disconnection between voters and the political class,\u201d said Jessica Sainty, politics lecturer at Avignon University, while acknowledging the Covid-19 crisis also played a role in high abstention rate.\n\nThe woeful turnout prompted a debate over how to improve participation, with several figures including government spokesman Gabriel Attal suggesting electronic voting could help in future.\n\nAccording to a poll published Thursday, just 36 percent of voters plan to cast their ballots on Sunday. \u201cFrance is sulking,\u201d the Le Parisien newspaper said.\n\nFour hours after polls opened, turnout on Sunday stood at the same dismal 12.66 percent as during the first round.\n\n\u2013 Far-right eyes breakthrough \u2013\n\nThe first-round results put Le Pen\u2019s National Rally (RN) ahead in just one region, PACA, a major disappointment after polls showed a possible breakthrough in several areas.\n\nOne of the most closely watched races on Sunday will be whether RN candidate Thierry Mariani can defeat his right-wing rival Renaud Muselier in the region.\n\nGaining control of a region for the first time would be a huge boost for Le Pen as she seeks to convince voters that the RN \u2014 which she has reformed and rebranded since taking over from her firebrand father Jean-Marie \u2014 is a serious party of power.\n\nMuselier could be helped by the withdrawal of left-wing candidates in a repeat of the \u201cRepublican Front\u201d seen in past presidential elections to block the far-right.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a victory for Mariani \u2014 even if it is far from being probable \u2014 would show that the RN can almost triumph alone over the coalition of all the others and head the powerful executive of a modern region,\u201d said Jerome Sainte-Marie, president of the Pollingvox Institute.\n\nMariani has been accused by critics of being an admirer of authoritarians like Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Prime Minister Jean Castex warned last week that a Mariani victory would be \u201cvery serious\u201d for the country.\n\nThe RN also came up short in the Ile-de-France region that includes Paris, where its 25-year-old rising star Jordan Bardella failed to trouble right-wing incumbent Valerie Pecresse, who is now expected to easily win the second round.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Lacks local presence\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe first-round results made even more unpalatable reading for Macron and his LREM, confirming the party\u2019s failure to put down local and regional roots despite controlling the presidency and lower house of parliament.\n\nDespite sending several ministers to campaign and Macron himself embarking on a nationwide tour \u2014 that saw him slapped by an onlooker at one point \u2014 in some regions LREM did not muster the required 10 percent to make round two.\n\n\u201c2022: What if it wasn\u2019t them?\u201d asked the headline in the left-wing Liberation newspaper over a picture of Macron and Le Pen.\n\nLREM has almost no chance of winning control of a single region and is currently just number five among political parties in France.\n\nThe Socialists are expected to pick up some regions, partly due to support from the far-left France Unbowed party.\n\n\u201cLREM lacks a local presence, but in 2017 that did not prevent them from winning the presidential and legislative elections,\u201d said Sainty.\n\nVoting began at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) on Sunday, with the last polling stations due to close 12 hours later.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The world\u2019s number-one ranked side Belgium take on holders Portugal in a standout Euro 2020 tie in Spain for a place in the quarter-finals.\n\nAll eyes will be on Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku and Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who have scored eight goals between them at Euro 2020.\n\nRonaldo, who is the tournament\u2019s leading scorer on five goals, is one away from setting a new men\u2019s record for most national team goals.\n\nThe last-16 tie takes place in Seville.\n\nLeicester City\u2019s Youri Tielemans could return for the match, which will include extra-time and penalties if it is level after 90 and 120 minutes respectively. Tielemans started the first two group wins but did not play against Finland.\n\nWolves defender Nelson Semedo picked up a knock in Portugal\u2019s last outing against France but has since returned to training.\n\nManchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes is hoping to return to the starting line-up after being dropped to the bench for the last game.\n\nDespite being top of Fifa\u2019s world rankings, Belgium have yet to win a major tournament.\n\nAlong with Italy and the Netherlands, Roberto Martinez\u2019s team were one of three sides to finish the group stage with a maximum nine points.\n\nWhile Italy and the Netherlands played their three games at \u2018home\u2019 in Rome and Amsterdam respectively, Belgium overcame Russia in St Petersburg, came from behind to beat Denmark in Copenhagen before returning to St Petersburg to defeat Finland.\n\nEuro 2016 winners Portugal made it through to the last 16 as one of the best four third-placed teams.\n\nThey lost to Germany 4-2 in Munich after winning 3-0 in Hungary before a dramatic 2-2 draw with world champions France in Budapest.\n\nSince the end of the 2018 World Cup, Lukaku has scored 23 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions for Belgium, while also providing four assists.\n\nThe Inter Milan forward netted three goals in the group stage, including two in one match against Russia.\n\nRonaldo, 36, is now the top-scoring European player at major tournaments (World Cup and European Championship), with his double against France in the last game moving him beyond Miroslav Klose (19) to 21 goals.\n\nIndeed, that was Ronaldo\u2019s second double of Euro 2020 already \u2013 no player has registered three in a single tournament at the European Championship.\n\n\u201cAt his age, he continues to shine and I\u2019m going to try and get as close to his achievements as possible,\u201d Lukaku, 28, said of his Portuguese rival.\n\nBoth sides have got plenty of match-winners, capable of a moment of genius. I\u2019d argue Belgium have the edge going forward but their defence has got mistakes in them.\n\nIt is very difficult to call, and I think this will be settled by a penalty shoot-out.\n\nSimon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen\u2019s Gracenote: Belgium are the top-ranked club in Europe according to Gracenote\u2019s World Ranking, ahead of France, Italy and Portugal.\n\nProgress to the last 16 has increased Belgium\u2019s chance of winning the tournament from 14.1% to 15% but they are now second favourites due to being in the tougher half of the draw.\n\nPortugal have been unlucky with the draw in this tournament, firstly ending up in Group F with France and Germany, and now having to face Belgium in the last 16.\n\nPortugal\u2019s Gracenote World Football Ranking of fourth in Europe implies that they are capable of a semi-final place but they first have to knock out a team who are theoretically better than them.\n\nThis is the first meeting between Belgium and Portugal at a major tournament.\n\nPortugal are unbeaten in their past five matches against Belgium across all competitions (W3 D2) since a 3-0 defeat in World Cup qualifying in September 1989.\n\nBelgium have only failed to score in two of their last 58 games under Roberto Martinez.\n\nDespite playing just 134 minutes so far, Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in three of Belgium\u2019s seven goals at Euro 2020, netting once and providing two assists.\n\nBelgium\u2019s victory over Finland last time out marked their ninth win at a World Cup and European Championship combined under Roberto Martinez, with the Spaniard now holding the outright managerial record for major tournament wins with the Red Devils.\n\nPortugal have conceded six goals in three games at Euro 2020 so far, already one more than they did at Euro 2016 when they went on to lift the trophy.\n\nPortugal have qualified for the knockout stages of the European Championship in third place for the second tournament in a row, also doing so in 2016 before going on to win it.\n\nPortugal\u2019s return of four points from three group games is the poorest return for a defending champion at a European Championship since Greece in 2008.",

          "text": "Donald Trump has held his first campaign-style rally since leaving the White House, repeating his election grievances and baseless claims of fraud as he urged his supporters to help Republicans win back majorities in the United States Congress.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally in Ohio \u2013 a state the former president carried in the 2020 election \u2013 marks a return to the kind of freewheeling mass gatherings that have been critical to retaining the support of his base.\n\nIt was held to support Max Miller, a former White House aide who is challenging Republican Representative Anthony Gonzalez for his congressional seat. Gonzalez was one of 10 Republican House members who voted to impeach Trump for his role in inciting the January 6 attack on the US Capitol in the wake of his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nTrump has pledged to back those who challenge the 10 legislators in the upcoming Republican primaries.\n\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress will be on the line in the 2022 midterm elections and history favors Republicans\u2019 chances of gaining seats in those contests.\n\n\u201cWe will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon,\u201d Trump told thousands of cheering supporters at Ohio\u2019s Lorain County Fairgrounds.\n\nSo far, nine of the 10 House Republicans who voted for Trump\u2019s impeachment have drawn primary challengers. The former president has offered to support anyone who steps forward to challenge the remaining candidate, Representative John Katko of New York, according to the website syracuse.com.\n\nTrump has also endorsed a challenger to Senator Lisa Murkowski, the only one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict him in his January impeachment trial who is up for re-election in 2022.\n\nThe Ohio event in Wellington, about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Cleveland, was the first of three public appearances, followed by a trip to the US-Mexico border on June 30 and a rally in Sarasota, Florida, on July 3.\n\nWhile Trump praised Miller as an \u201cincredible patriot\u201d and a \u201cgreat guy\u201d who \u201cloves the people of Ohio,\u201d he spent much of his 90-minute address fixating on the 2020 election, which he insists he won, even though top state and local election officials, his own attorney general and numerous judges, including some he appointed, have said there is no evidence of the mass voter fraud he alleges took place.\n\n\u201cThis was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe 2020 presidential election was rigged. We won that election in a landslide.\u201d\n\nThe crowd chanted \u201cTrump won\u201d and \u201cfour more years! four more years!\u201d. But the former president made no clear mention of his political future.\n\nHe did however tease the crowd at one point by alluding to the possibility of another stab at the White House.\n\n\u201cWe may have to win it a third time. It is possible,\u201d he said.\n\nA supporter waits for former President Donald Trump to speak at a rally at the Lorain County Fairgrounds, Saturday, June 26, 2021, in Wellington, Ohio [Tony Dejak/ AP]\n\nWhether Trump runs again could be influenced by the outcome of various legal troubles.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan informed his company on Thursday that it could soon face criminal charges stemming from a wide-ranging investigation into the former president\u2019s business dealings. The New York Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that charges could be filed against the Trump Organization within days.\n\nTrump has denounced the investigations as nothing more than a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d aimed at damaging him politically.\n\nThe former president also used the Ohio rally to lambast Biden, calling him a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d and focusing on the rising number of immigrants crossing over the US southern border \u2013 an issue Republicans have zeroed in on to rally their voters.\n\n\u201cYou have millions of people coming into our country. We have no idea who they are. Joe Biden is doing the exact opposite as we did,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden is destroying our nation before our very eyes,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump\u2019s rallies have been instrumental to his politics since he launched his 2016 campaign and his supporters in Ohio said they hoped he would use such events to help unify the party behind like-minded candidates for Congress.\n\n\u201cContinuing these rallies is extremely important,\u201d said Jessica Dicken, a 30-year-old stay-at-home mother from southeast Ohio, adding Trump could be \u201ca voice for the more conservative movement here in Ohio and across the nation\u201d.\n\nChris Laskowski, 55, who lives in Medina, Ohio, said she missed Trump.\n\n\u201cI think they robbed him of the election and he\u2019s still our president.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s repeated false claims of election fraud have taken hold of the Republican Party, with 53 percent of Republican voters saying they believe Trump won the 2020 election, according to a Reuters/ Ipsos poll. They blamed his loss on illegal voting, the poll found.\n\nRepublican strategist Matt Dole said both Trump and those vying to stay close to him benefited from the public bonhomie on display at the Ohio event. Some of the candidates now seeking his endorsement have made disparaging comments about Trump in the past.\n\n\u201cThese are marriages of convenience,\u201d said Dole, who is based in Ohio. \u201cDonald Trump is using these opportunities to keep his name out there, to keep the base motivated.\u201d",

          "text": "Authorities in several countries \u2013 from Bangladesh and Indonesia to Australia and Israel \u2013 are racing to contain the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus, while Russia\u2019s Saint Petersburg announced a record death toll, laying bare the challenges faced by nations worldwide in their efforts to return to pre-pandemic life.\n\nWhile vaccination campaigns have brought down infections in mostly wealthy nations, the rise of the Delta variant has stoked fears of new waves of a virus that has already killed nearly four million people.\n\n\u201cThere is currently a lot of concern about the Delta variant,\u201d World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a Friday news briefing.\n\n\u201cDelta is the most transmissible of the variants identified so far, has been identified in at least 85 countries and is spreading rapidly among unvaccinated populations.\u201d\n\nIn Bangladesh, authorities announced they would impose a new national lockdown from Monday over the variant, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed.\n\nAustralia\u2019s largest city Sydney, meanwhile, entered a two-week lockdown, with people ordered to stay home except for essential trips.\n\nSydney\u2019s new restrictions apply to some five million people, along with hundreds of thousands of others living in nearby towns.\n\nNew Zealand, citing \u201cmultiple outbreaks\u201d in Australia, announced a three-day suspension of its quarantine-free travel arrangement with its larger neighbour.\n\nAustralia\u2019s COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the suspension would give officials time to consider measures \u201cto make the bubble safer, such as pre-departure testing for all flights\u201d between the two countries.\n\nIn Indonesia, President Joko Widodo said the country of 270 million people was facing an \u201cextraordinary situation\u201d and pledged to respond with \u201cquick and appropriate policies\u201d. The country recorded more than 21,000 new infections on Saturday, the highest daily tally yet.\n\nDelta, which was first identified in India in April, is so contagious that experts say more than 80 percent of a population would need to be inoculated in order to contain it \u2013 a challenging target even for nations with significant vaccination programmes.\n\nThe variant is now responsible for more than 90 percent of all new infections in the United Kingdom and about 30 percent in the United States.\n\nEuropean scientists estimate Delta is 40 to 60 percent more contagious than the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), first discovered in the United Kingdom, which itself was more infectious than the original virus first detected in late 2019.\n\n\u201cIt infects more people, it can spread faster,\u201d vaccinologist Dr Annelies Wilder Smith, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told Al Jazeera. \u201cWe saw it in India. We\u2019re seeing it in Australia and Indonesia, in the UK. And I think we\u2019ll see now increasingly in Europe, and indeed, also in the Americas,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it really also causes more severe disease has not yet been confirmed. So if you see more disease you will also see more hospitalisations \u2013 that does not mean that the virus itself causes more severe disease.\u201d\n\nExperts say Delta spreads more easily because of mutations that help it latch onto cells in the body. While several studies have shown that vaccines are slightly less effective against Delta, they are still highly effective \u2013 but only after the second dose.\n\nIsrael, which has one of the world\u2019s most successful vaccination campaigns, has seen infections linked to the variant surge since dropping a requirement to wear masks in enclosed public places 10 days ago.\n\nAfter four days of more than 100 new cases a day, the health ministry has now reversed that decision.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s Euro 2020 host Saint Petersburg on Saturday reported the country\u2019s highest daily COVID-19 death toll for a city since the start of the pandemic.\n\nOfficial figures said Saint Petersburg, which has already hosted six matches of the football tournament and is due to host a quarter-final on Friday, recorded 107 virus deaths during the past 24 hours.\n\nAuthorities in the Russian city tightened anti-coronavirus restrictions last week in an effort to curb the spike in new infections, including closing food courts in the city\u2019s shopping malls and its Euro 2020 fan zone. This came as Russia has seen an explosion of new cases since mid-June, driven by the Delta variant.\n\nIn neighbouring Finland, health officials said they had detected a spike in coronavirus infections that was traced to football fans returning from Saint Petersburg. The Finnish health institute\u2019s director, Mika Salminen, told public broadcaster YLE that more than 120 cases have so far been identified from passengers returning from the Russian city, mostly football fans, and the number is likely to increase.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Paul Brennan, reporting from London, said there have been concerns about a link between the tournament and COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\n\u201cAttendance at these stadiums has been pre-conditional on you actually showing a negative coronavirus test. But that doesn\u2019t stop people\u2019s mingling in the streets and mixing with other members of the public who don\u2019t have to go through these tests,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned infections were also surging at an alarming rate in at least 12 countries in Africa, with the Delta variant leading to unprecedented hospitalisations.\n\nAccording to the WHO, only one percent of Africans are fully vaccinated \u2013 the lowest ratio globally.\n\nIn South Africa, the continent\u2019s worst-hit country, scientists said on Saturday the Delta variant appeared to be dominating new infections. On Friday, authorities registered 18,000 new cases.\n\nActing Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane told the same news conference that it was now likely that the peak of the third wave would surpass the peak of the second wave in January.\n\nIn Europe, however, some countries announced the lifting of restrictions even as scientists have warned that Delta was expected to account for 90 percent of all new cases in the European Union by the end of August.\n\nSpain on Saturday brought an end to mandatory outdoor mask-wearing, a year after the rule was first introduced.\n\nThe decision came despite the announcement of a major coronavirus cluster in the capital, Madrid, traced to a student trip to the holiday island of Mallorca, with more than 2,000 people ordered to self-isolate.\n\nThe Netherlands also ended its rules on outdoor mask-wearing, while easing restrictions on indoor dining and reopening nightclubs to people who have tested negative.\n\nAnd Switzerland scrapped most of its remaining coronavirus restrictions on Saturday after Health Minister Alain Berset said this week that the country\u2019s use of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines gave adequate protection against the Delta variant.",

          "text": "A proposal by the South African government to legalise polyandry \u2013 when a woman has more than one husband at the same time \u2013 has led to howls of protest from conservative quarters.\n\nThis does not surprise Professor Collis Machoko, a renowned academic on the topic.\n\nThe objections are \u201cabout control,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cAfrican societies are not ready for true equality. We don\u2019t know what to do with women we cannot control.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa has one of the world\u2019s most liberal constitutions, embracing same-sex marriages for all and polygamy for men.\n\nBusinessman and TV personality Musa Mseleku \u2013 who has four wives \u2013 is among those opposed to polyandry.\n\n\u201cThis will destroy African culture. What about the children of those people? How will they know their identity?\u201d asks Mr Mseleku, who stars in a South African reality TV show about his polygamous family.\n\n\u201cThe woman cannot now take the role of the man. It\u2019s unheard of. Will the woman now pay lobola (bride price) for the man. Will the man be expected to take her surname?\u201d\n\nProf Machoko researched polyandry in his country of birth \u2013 neighbouring Zimbabwe. He spoke to 20 women and 45 co-husbands who practised it, even though such marriages are socially taboo and not legally recognised.\n\n\u201cPolyandry, because it is shunned by parts of society, has been forced underground. The secrecy is similar to the one found in freemasons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen confronted by somebody whom they do not trust or do not know, they even deny that such a marriage exists. All this is because of fear of reprisals and persecution.\u201d\n\nThe participants in Prof Machoko\u2019s study all lived separately but were committed to the polyandrous union and were open about it among themselves.\n\n\u201cOne wife nourished the idea of wanting to be a polyandrous woman when she was in grade six [aged around 12 years] after learning about how the queen bee in a hive hosts many bee co-husbands,\u201d the professor said.\n\nWhen she was an adult she started having sex with multiple partners who were all aware of each other.\n\n\u201cFour of her current nine co-husbands were in that first group of boyfriends.\u201d\n\nIn polyandry, the woman often initiates the relationships, and invites the husbands to join her union. Some pay the bride price, others opt to contribute to her livelihood. She has the power to remove a co-husband if she believes he is destabilising her other relationships.\n\nProf Machoko said love was the main reason the men he interviewed said they had agreed to be co-husbands. They did not want to risk losing their wife.\n\nSome men also referred to the fact that they did not satisfy their wives sexually, agreeing to the suggestion of a co-husband to avoid divorce or affairs.\n\nAnother reason was infertility \u2013 some men consented to the wife taking another husband so that she could have children. In this way, the men \u201csaved face\u201d in public and avoided being stigmatised as \u201cemasculated\u201d.\n\nProf Machoko said he was unaware of polyandrous marriages in South Africa. Nevertheless, gender rights activists have asked the government to legalise such unions in the interest of equality and choice, as the law currently permits a man to take more than one wife.\n\nTheir proposal has been included in a document \u2013 officially known as a Green Paper \u2013 that the government has released for public comment as it embarks on the biggest overhaul of marriage laws since white-minority rule ended in 1994.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that this Green Paper sets to uphold human rights and we cannot lose sight of that,\u201d said Charlene May, an advocate at the Women\u2019s Legal Centre, a law firm that fights for women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cWe cannot reject law reform because it challenges certain patriarchal views in our society.\u201d",

          "text": "British Health Minister Matt Hancock has resigned, a day after being called out for breaking social distancing rules by kissing an aide.\n\nThe 42-year-old handed his resignation to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday after The Sun tabloid published photos of the married minister embracing a woman who he had appointed to a taxpayer-funded role to scrutinise the performance of his department.\n\nThe pictures that enraged the public and politicians were taken on May 6 \u2013 11 days before lockdown rules were eased to allow hugs and other physical contact with people outside one\u2019s own household.\n\nHancock has been at the centre of the government\u2019s fight against the coronavirus pandemic, routinely appearing on television and radio to tell people to follow the strict rules to contain the virus.\n\nHis departure means Johnson will have to appoint a new minister to take on the huge department that is responsible for overseeing the health service and tackling COVID-19 at a time when cases have started to rise again.\n\nJohnson had said on Friday he had accepted an apology from Hancock and considered the matter to be closed, but the latter had faced rising pressure to step down.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down as I have done by breaching the guidance,\u201d Hancock said in his resignation letter.\n\nJohnson said in reply that he was sorry to receive it.\n\n\u201cYou should be immensely proud of your service,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am grateful for your support and believe that your contribution to public service is far from over.\u201d\n\nThe main opposition Labour Party also questioned whether he had broken the ministerial code: the woman, a longtime friend of Hancock\u2019s, was appointed as a non-executive director, on a taxpayer-funded salary, to oversee the running of his ministry.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer said on Twitter that Hancock was right to resign. \u201cBut Boris Johnson should have sacked him,\u201d he added.\n\nWith 128,000 deaths, the United Kingdom has one of the highest official death tolls from COVID-19 in the world and Hancock, in the post for almost three years, had been heavily criticised for his initial handling of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, Johnson\u2019s Conservative government has been boosted by a rapid rollout of the vaccine programme, with 84 percent of adults having one dose and 61 percent having both, well ahead of most other countries.",
