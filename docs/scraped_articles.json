That way, the APC can know the number of members they have state by state and local government by local government, so that by the time this administration goes, the legacy can continue.\n\n\u201cAnd that is the best way to go for the party and for the country.\u201d\n\nHe also rebuffed claims that joining APC automatically exonerated corrupt leaders from any lingering charges or investigations, saying that those who hold such views are not being fair to his regime.\n\nSpeaking on zoning and succession plan, Buhari reiterated that the APC will be the sole deciding factor.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we allow the party to decide, I just told you that we started from the bottom to the top.\n\n\u201cI told the acting chairman and a committee to give me the report by the end of the month on the convention they are going to conduct and then arrange general elections until 2023. All the elections.\n\n\u201cAnd we started this from bottom to the up, so that members of the party will be sure they are involved in decision making.\n\n\u201cNobody is just going to sit in Lagos and tell them what to do.

          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has given approval to the return of the open grazing practised during the 1st Republic where herdsmen used designated grazing routes to move their cattle to several parts of the country.\n\nTo this end, the President said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, to begin the process of recovering land from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes for their personal use.\n\nBuhari said this during an interview with Arise Television which was aired on Thursday.\n\nThe President said the grazing routes were designated in the 1st Republic when \u201cNigerians use to obey laws\u201d but those routes had been converted.\n\nBuhari was reacting to a question on the decision by 17 southern governors to ban open grazing.\n\nThe AGF had kicked against the declaration by the governors, adding that it was like northern governors banning spare part trading, a job that is synonymous with southerners.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with the AGF\u2019s position, Buhari laughingly responded, \u201cYou want me to contradict my attorney-general?\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said, \u201cWhat I did was ask him to go and dig the gazette of the 1st Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south or east to west, they had to go through there.\n\n\u201cIf you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known.\n\n\u201cBut I am telling you, this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nHe also lamented the style and utterances of Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, who had not only implemented an aggressive anti-open grazing law but had accused Buhari of failing to take actions against herdsmen because he is also a member of the Fulani herders.\n\nBuhari said indeed, he is a Fulani man but Ortom was being unfair to him. He said he had told Ortom that the herdsmen perpetrating the attacks are not the Nigerian ones.\n\nThe President further explained that the Tivs, which form the majority in Benue, and the Fulanis had been engaged in cultural conflicts for a long time.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. There is a cultural difference between the Tivs and the Fulanis. So, the governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them.\n\n\u201cI cannot say I am not one of them but he is being very unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer was not carrying anything more than a stick sometime with a machete to cut some trees and feed his cattle but those sophisticated ones move with AK 47.\n\n\u201cSo, from other areas, people rush to Nigeria you know and Fulanis from Mauritania and Central Africa look the same so they feel they are the Nigerian ones and I assure you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes, grazing areas and make them accountable.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022They took over my uncompleted building, sold it \u2014 Oyedele\n\n\u2022How my hand was cut \u2014 Victim\n\nBy Gabriel Olawale\n\nThe residents of Ipetu Baba-Ode Itusi-Ilogbo in Ado-Odo Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State are currently living in fear over series of attacksby thugs which was facilitated by a land dispute between the Adelupo family led by Yaya Are Alayande and the Itusi Royal Family led by Chief Taofeek Oduasanyin.\n\n\n\nWhile some residents have fled the area for safety, others who have no place to go were forced to live in fear.\n\n\n\nWhen Vanguard visited the community, some of the residents shared their ugly experiences in the hands of the thugs even as they made it clear that the thugs threatened them with constant attack just to force them to vacate the land they are occupying.\n\n\n\nIt was with tears that Mr. Taiwo Oyedele, 49, whose building was forcefully taken over by land grabbers and sold to another person to complete his ongoing building construction, narrated his ordeal.\n\n\n\nOyedele said: \u201cI bought a plot of land from the Itusi Royal family in 2012. As an artisan, I was building the house with my little savings gradually with four shops in front of it. Since the house was yet to be completed, I was not living there.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne day, I received a call from people living around the place that they have sold my house to another person and they have started building on my ongoing project. I was so sad and informed one of my brothers who is a soldier. He accompanied me to the place and we reported the case to the police.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Area Commander was so angry and told the police officer in charge of the case to organise a meeting between all the parties involved. But the police officer in charge of that case didn\u2019t make that happen; he prevented me from seeing theArea Commander, while they kept on building on my house.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow my hand was cut\u2014Victim\n\nAlso speaking, Farouq Obitusi, 21, who tried to prevent the thugs from looting his mother\u2019s shop, was brutalized and sustained a deep cut on his left hand.\n\n\n\nObitusi said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand by and watch while my mother\u2019s shop was looted. I thank God that I am alive. They were about 12 in number with different dangerous weapons.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen somebody shouted that people should call the police, they boasted that police cannot do anything to them, that they are Owo eye boys. I don\u2019t know what they meant by that. But we eventually reported the case to Oinpanu Division in Ota.\u201d\n\n\n\nNarrow escape from a stray bullet\n\nOn his part, a man who identified himself as Najimu narrated his narrow escape from a stray bullet that nearly took his life.\n\nHe explained that when the case was reported at the FCID Gender Unit in Abuja, some policemen came to investigate the matter but since they did not know the location, he volunteered to lead them to the said land in dispute.\n\n\n\nNajimu said: \u201cOn getting to the location, only God knows those who informed the thugs guarding the land that we were around, they came in large numbers and the policemen were able to escape and in the process, I sustained stray bullet injury.\u201d\n\nWe got judgment from court\u2014 Itusi Royal Family\n\nWhen contacted, Chief Adekunle Funmilayo, who is the legal consultant to Itusi Royal Family said that they got judgment from a court in their favour and instead of the other party to appeal the case; they resorted to victimizing people who are residing on the land.\n\nFunmilayo said: \u201cWe have Form O which is a certificate of execution. After the judgement, we took possession of the land until the people we defeated, Adelupo family led by Yaya Are Alayande, invaded the land with suspected thugs known as Owo Eye boys and unleashed mayhem on the residents.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are law-abiding citizens and so, we wrote a petition to Inspector-General of Police who sent policemen from the gender unit in FCID Abuja to investigate the matter. They were attacked with guns, the policemen narrowly escaped and it was there that Najimu sustained a gun injury. Three of the thugs were caught with guns.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thugs mentioned those who sent them and they were invited to Abuja. One of them that showed up, Yaya Alayande was made to sign an undertaking to maintain peace, but yet, they continue to come to the land with guns and cutlass.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police in Ogun State apprehended another nine of them again and recovered about two other guns.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur Appeal to the Ogun State government and Federal Government is to arrest those perpetrating this atrocity so that residents of Ipetu Baba-Ode Itusi-Ilogbo in Ado-Odo Ota, Ogun State can continue to live in peace.\u201d",

          "text": "By Ola Ajayi\n\nWHEN the uninvited messengers of death invaded Igangan community in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State, they left in their trail blood, tears and pains.\n\nHouses, where they committed the heinous crimes, can best be described as slaughter slabs.\n\n\n\nThere were clots of blood all around, flies of different species feasted on the caked blood of the victims.\n\n\n\nOne wonders if the ancestors of Igangan went to sleep when the assailants struck.\n\n\n\nThese harbingers of death, who reportedly operated from 11 pm on Saturday till 4am, on Sunday, desecrated the royal stool of the monarch in the city, Oba Lasisi Adeoye.\n\n\n\nThey aimed at his life but his ancestors prevented him from sleeping in the palace which they ransacked and burnt to ashes.\n\n\n\nOther buildings too were torched by the marauders.\n\nSo far, the residents claimed they counted 25 bodies, while the Oyo State Police Command put the death toll at 11.\n\n\n\nThough fragile peace is noticeable in the troubled spots, stern-looking soldiers have taken over the security of the sleepy town.\n\n\n\nVanguard gathered that the General Officer Commanding 2 Div, Nigerian Army in the company of about eight vehicles had visited the place.\n\n\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, too, Ngozi Onadeko was there immediately after the carnage.\n\n\n\nAccording to one of the local securitymen who confronted the hoodlums, the attackers would have recorded more casualties on their side \u201cif the Federal Government had licensed us to carry arms.\u201d\n\n\n\nYouths angry with police\n\nIt was the intervention of the Chairman of Ibadan North Local Government, Mr. Lateef Lawal that prevented the angry youths from burning down the police station in the area.\n\n\n\nThe youths claimed that the police were partial in their duties alleging that they were exposing them to danger.\n\n\n\nWomen go into hiding\n\nFindings by Vanguard revealed that women in Igangan and its environs have gone into hiding for fear of being caught by the hoodlums.\n\n\n\nVanguard was reliably informed that except for men, women now stay indoors.\n\n\n\nAlso, the looks of the youths, who now keep 24-hour vigilance, were not inviting. But for the local vigilante man who was of tremendous help, they were not ready to receive any visitor.\n\n\n\nThe remnants of Fulani men, who waited after the eviction of the Seriki, were said to have fled the town for fear of being attacked by the angry youths.\n\n\n\nAttack was a reprisal\u2014Source\n\nSpeaking on the possible cause of the attack, the spokesperson of Igangan people, Mr. Taiwo Adeagbo said the attack which, he maintained, was carried out by Fulani herders was a revenge mission.\n\n\n\nWhen asked from another source why they said it was a reprisal, he said, some people recognised one of the attackers to be an aide to the exiled Seriki and that one man who was close to Wakili was also sighted.\n\n\n\nAccording to information gathered, the hoodlums went straight to the palace of the king, Oba Adeoye to avenge the burning of the palace of their Seriki who was forced to flee at the climax of the crisis in January this year.\n\n\n\nWhy we\u2019re yet to fight for Yoruba\u2014Agbekoya\n\nThe National Leader of Agbekoya, a revolutionary group, Chief Olalekan Akeekaka said the attackers would not have been able to get away with the attacks if the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi; the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi and the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji had given them the approval to defend the zone.\n\n\n\nAkeekaka said: \u201cThe Federal Government did not give us the license to carry AK 47. The bandits have sophisticated weapons. Anyone who confronts them with ordinary Dane guns will waste his life.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we go there now, if they shoot at us, we will be forced to respond. If any of them dies, the government will come for us. See the case of the OPC men that arrested Wakili, an alleged serial kidnapper. Up till now, the OPC men are still in detention.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the alternative, let the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi and the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji give us approval that we should go ahead so that if things go awry, we will have someone we can run to for cover.\u201d\n\n\n\nSunday Igboho on the trail of bandits\n\nOn Monday, the Yoruba freedom proponent, Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Igboho went with his men to Igangan where he pacified Igangan residents.\n\n\n\nImmediately he entered the town, his spokesperson, Mr. Oluyomi Koiki announced his arrival which attracted a large crowd.\n\n\n\nVanguard gathered that Igboho, who was in Ekiti State at the time of the attack, is on the trail of the hoodlums.\n\n\n\nIgboho who wore a forlorn look was seen in a viral video waving intermittently to the cheering crowd.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard, the Balogun of Idiyan which is some kilometers away from Igangan, said Igboho paid a visit to the ruler of Idiyan where he was entertained by the king. He then continued his journey.\n\n\n\nFG should allow Amotekun bear arms \u2014Senator Balogun\n\nWhile condemning the attack, Senator Kola Balogun, who represents Oyo South in the Senate, said to curb the wanton destruction of lives and property by these bandits, the Federal Government should grant the Western Nigeria Security Network permission to carry arms.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAmotekun is active and the outfit is working even with the police. As a matter of fact, the situation would have been worse but for Amotekun and other local security outfits because from the report that I got, the people that came to invade had bigger plans than what happened.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was the community, the Amotekun and the local vigilantes that were mobilised in the middle of the night even though they were ambushed because they were not expecting them; they mitigated the effects of the damage\u201d\n\n\n\nA source told Vanguard that there is still tension in Igangan as most people are armed to forestall another occurrence.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers too were parading the streets to nip any other crisis in the bud.\n\nMakinde sues for peace, Alaafin condemns attacks\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde said he was briefed about the incident advising the opposition party, APC, not to politicize the attack.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we speak, insecurity has been weaponised and decentralised, while all parts of the country have become endangered. Even the President\u2019s own state of Katsina is not spared as the sad incidents of kidnapping and killings continue to happen even during his official visits to the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe APC in Oyo State has zero justification to comment on the security situation in the state, as we all know that the Constitution of Nigeria has completely vested the command and control of security agencies in the President. If the President has refused to use his constitutionally granted power to curb insecurity, why should members of his party attempt to shift the blame to Governor Makinde, who has provided needed logistics for all security agencies in the state, while also setting up homegrown initiatives to tackle insecurity?\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the APC leaders want to be patriotic, they will call on the leader of their party, President Buhari, to wake up and stop the unwarranted killings across the land: the kidnapping of school children and other innocent Nigerians and fix the economy.\n\nOn his part, the Alaafin, through his Media and Publicity Director, Mr. Bode Durojaiye, said: \u201cThe fundamental thing is how you deal with these challenges. We can sustain national security operations or options by using native intelligence gathering as a response to a national security threat.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is important for the government to take a holistic view on information gathering as a system for addressing insecurity, just as there is the urgent need to deploy technologies required for the identification of criminal suspects.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the permanent chairman of Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, and as a custodian of traditions and values, traditional rulers are the ones who keep peace in our rural areas and in the various local governments that constitute our State. We are indeed formidable barricades which reinforce peace and security of the nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Adewale Osifeso confirmed that 11 people died while the crisis lasted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "By Ola AjayiWHEN the uninvited messengers of death invaded Igangan community in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of Oyo State, they left in their trail blood, tears and pains.\nOne wonders if the ancestors of Igangan went to sleep when the assailants struck.\nSo far, the residents claimed they counted 25 bodies, while the Oyo State Police Command put the death toll at 11.\nThough fragile peace is noticeable in the troubled spots, stern-looking soldiers have taken over the security of the sleepy town.\nWomen go into hidingFindings by Vanguard revealed that women in Igangan and its environs have gone into hiding for fear of being caught by the hoodlums.",

          "text": "To take a beautiful shot, you always have to check conditions and then intend to capture.\n\nFor instance, in a situation, say a spectacular scenery that sometimes makes it very difficult and complicated to take a photo.\n\nBut nothing could defeat photographers who are madly interested in this work.\n\nToday, I am going to talk about a girl who is one of the greatest and most popular Iranian photographers who has been able to cross the boundaries of incredibility and becomes a very successful person in his life and highly influential in society, and has millions of fans.\n\nBahareh Salehnia, born in Iran on September 16, 1993, is now globally known and a self-made person.\n\nBahareh is one of the most tasteful photographers, whose interest in this field has always made her able to go further and further, and by running the MCSIP brand and sharing his photos in social media in a very pervasive way and engage people\u2019s eyes and thoughts.\n\nBahareh, as a good teacher in photography, does her activities very seriously, and with the love she has for this work, she has been able to attract millions of fans from all over the world.\n\nBahareh recently answered a question she was asked about the photography concepts:\n\nPhotography is not an art, it is a culture, or rather a science that cannot be continued without acquiring it. Photographers produce and preserve images that capture a scene, create a story, or record an event. To create photos with high quality, photographers must have both technical expertise and creativity.\n\nCreating a successful image requires selecting and presenting a subject with the ability to make a special impact and select the appropriate equipment. For example, photographers may enhance the appearance of a subject by lightening it, or by blurring the background to focus the viewer\u2019s attention on a particular aspect of the image.\n\nMost people who want to hire photographers are mostly looking for people who have high visual imagination and in addition to a deep understanding of photography and imaging, also have outstanding creativity.\n\nThose who work in facial issues or are active freely must have a high level of professional efficiency, and it does not matter if they have achieved this ability through formal education, experimental work, or professional work.\n\nBahareh launched its recent course, \u201cSuccess in Photography\u201d (MCSIP), which teaches lesser-known tricks and tips in professional photography. She has proven that MCSIP is very popular around the world, and has become the most popular photography course in Iran as well.",

We shall not give up or be overwhelmed by the suffering and hopelessness foisted on us by the APC Government because we can already see light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cIf a society is not fully informed of the atrocious and pernicious nature of the party in government, the people may always be cajoled or beguiled through well-oiled and orchestrated propaganda machinery, into believing that the government is working in the interest of the people.\u201d\n\nOn the planned nationwide protest on June 12, Hon Adams said the protest was not what the country needs at this time but a national dialogue to find a solution to the problems of Nigeria.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu had last week performed the groundbreaking of a new governor\u2019s lodge saying it would take a \u201csuperman to live in the lodge built by Mimiko.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said it was Mimiko that informed him about defects in the building.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis state deserves a Governor Lodge to be a pride to all of us.\n\nWhen Mimiko was handing over, he mentioned the defects and promised to fix it but he didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI called my engineer to look at it and I was told to either bring down the building or part of it.

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump ordered his top White House attorney to issue a false statement at the height of the Mueller investigation even though he knew that lying could carry criminal consequences for both of them, according to newly unearthed congressional testimony.\n\nDonald McGahn, who served as Trump\u2019s first White House counsel, told members of the House Judiciary Committee in a closed-door hearing last week that the ex-president instructed him to issue a statement in February 2018 denying that he had ever tried to fire former FBI director Robert Mueller, who was tasked with investigating obstruction in the 2016 election, according to a 241-page transcript of the testimony released Wednesday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump knew that statement \u201cwould not have been accurate\u201d since he had ordered McGahn months earlier to orchestrate Mueller\u2019s firing \u2014 a demand McGahn refused, he testified.\n\nTrump also knew at the time that McGahn had already told Mueller\u2019s investigators the truth and that the special counsel would not take kindly to the White House lawyer giving conflicting accounts of a key episode in his probe into whether the former president obstructed justice, according to the testimony.\n\n\u201c[Mueller] had already publicly made clear he was going after various people for that, and that certainly is one that would weigh on anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d McGahn testified, referring to false statement crimes, according to the transcript.\n\nNonetheless, Trump kept pressuring McGahn, making him feel \u201ctrapped,\u201d he testified.\n\n\u201cFrustrated, perturbed, trapped,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cMany emotions \u2026 Trapped because the president had the same conversation with me repeatedly, and I thought I conveyed my views and offered my advice, and we were still having the same conversation.\u201d\n\nOne of the judiciary committee\u2019s investigators asked McGahn during the June 4 hearing if he agreed with the characterization that Trump was asking him to \u201cdo crazy s\u2013t\u201d in first demanding Mueller\u2019s firing and then requesting a statement claiming it never happened.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fair,\u201d McGahn replied.\n\nTrump tried to block McGahn from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee for years, but the panel\u2019s chairperson, New York Representative Jerry Nadler, ultimately prevailed in court.\n\nREAD ALSO: Trump backs Nigeria on Twitter ban\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Nadler said McGahn\u2019s testimony provided \u201cfirst-hand accounts of President Trump\u2019s increasingly out of control behavior\u201d as Mueller dug deeper into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and possible obstruction of that inquiry.\n\n\u201cAll told, Mr McGahn\u2019s testimony gives us a fresh look at how dangerously close President Trump brought us to, in Mr McGahn\u2019s words, the \u2018point of no return,\u2019\u201d the New York Democrat said.\n\nAfter investigating Trump for nearly two years, Mueller concluded in his special counsel report that he did not uncover enough evidence to recommend that the former president or his campaign aides be charged with directly colluding in Russia\u2019s attack on the 2016 election.\n\nHowever, Mueller notably never exonerated Trump of obstructing his investigation.\n\nIn his report, Mueller listed off 10 individual instances of potential obstruction crimes committed by the former president.\n\nAfter Mueller\u2019s probe wrapped up, Trump went on to get impeached twice for conduct related to the 2020 election.\n\nThe former president maintains to this day that every investigation into his various alleged wrongdoing is part of a nefarious political \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d (tca/dpa/NAN)",

We therefore, warn perpetrators of these evil agenda to retrace their steps immediately or brace up for stiff resistance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IPOB spokesperson queried why youths in the North were not treated same way even after being identified as bandits.\n\n\u201cThe intention of the masterminds of this crime against humanity is to weaken the South East and pave the way for its long-planned invasion by jihadists. But they will not succeed.

          "text": "From Laide Raheem, Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has called on agitators for the disintegration to rethink the idea and work for the unity and oneness of the country.\n\nHe said it was better for Nigeria to remain as one indivisible nation than for each tribe to go its separate way.\n\nObasanjo made the call at the luncheon and his investiture as a Fellow of Nigerian Institution of Surveyor, organised by the Body of Fellow of the NIS, Ogun State chapter, yesterday.\n\nHe said though the situation in the country was not palatable, calling for the disintegration of the country was not the solution, declaring that \u201cit is better we stay together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is any Nigerian who does not feel apprehensive on the situation of the country, the person is a human being without being human. Any Nigerian who is human will be apprehensive, if not frustrated with the present situation in the country. We are apprehensive about security situation, apprehensive about economic situation, apprehensive about our political situation and the drum we are hearing is of disintegration of the country.\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer of one Nigeria, but not one Nigeria at any cost, but one Nigeria where every Nigerian can feel proud that he or she has a stake in this country/\n\n\u201cNo Nigerian is born a slave in this country. No Nigerian is born to be oppressed in this country and those of us that have shared part of our blood and sweat for this country, we did that because we wanted a country where every Nigerian can claim as his or her own.\n\n\u201cI believe that if we talk among ourselves the way we should and if we change the narrative, I believe this is a great country. That we are not making Nigeria what God wants it to be is not the fault of God but the fault of ourselves, particularly our leaders.\n\n\u201cOne thing that gives us strength is our diversity. If all that we have is Republic of Oduduwa for those who said so, their position is understandable. If that is all we have, members of that country will be diminished compared to be a citizen of Nigeria. Citizens of Oduduwa Republic or any other republic from Nigeria will be diminished compared to citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn this age and time that we are talking about the reintegration of Africa for economic development, disintegration of any country will be almost idiotic. Even if we have Igboland as an independent country, Yorubaland an independent country and Fulani/Hausaland an independent country.\n\n\u201cAnd as a friend of mine in the military used to say then, what will become of the over 300 minorities \u2013 the Jukuns, the Gbasamas? Where will they belong? The only reason they can raise up their heads is because they belong to Nigeria. Are we thinking of them or are we just being selfish? It doesn\u2019t matter what we do, we will still be neighbours.\n\n\u201cWe had seen it before; India was broken into India and Pakistan, they are still at war till today. Yugoslavia was broken into how many countries, they haven\u2019t sorted it till today. Sudan was broken into Sudan and South Sudan, I don\u2019t believe South Sudan is better for it and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cI believe it will cost us less to work for our unity. There are many things wrong but those things are correctable if we make efforts to correct them and hold us together than what it will cost us to break up and be perpetually at war and all our money will be spent in building an army. I know what an army contains, I know what it means to keep an army, an army that may not be productive. Let us think about it.\u201d\n\nOn the importance of survey to the national development, Obasanjo said the entire country should be surveyed in order to achieve economic development and transformation.\n\nHe therefore charged the national body of the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors to draft a proposal on the national survey of the country to the federal government.\n\n\u201cWhen I was the president of the country, the project of surveying the entire country began, but it got stuck and I don\u2019t know where the project is now,\u201d Obasanjo noted.\n\nThe state chairman, Nigerian Institution of Surveyors, Ademola Adebowale disclosed the Ogun State chapter of the NIS had concluded plans to produce a unique digital map of Ogun State which will be updated regularly for meaningful and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cThis will make us to become self sufficient in geospatial information which will affect all sectors positively and thereby increase the state internally generated revenue geometrically,\u201d Adebowale said.\n\nThe event held at the Marquee of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) Abeokuta, also saw to the investiture of Kehinde Isijola as the new chairman of the Body of the Fellows.",

          "text": "On Tuesday, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, defied the Nigerian government\u2019s Twitter ban.\n\nThe government had last Friday banned Twitter after the App deleted a controversial comment made by President Muhammadu Buhari, in which he made reference to the Nigerian Civil War, which many Nigerians described as distasteful.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nAmidst the public outcry and criticism that followed the government\u2019s decision, Malami on Saturday directed the Director of Public Prosecutions in his office to begin the process of prosecuting violators of the government suspension order.\n\nHowever in a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, the Attorney General posted a screenshot from the Twitter app showing his account has been deleted.\n\n\u201cMy Twitter account deactivated,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSaharaReporters further gathered that the Minister downloaded Virtual Private Network in order to visit Twitter to deactivate it.\n\nA critical look at the photo by just clicking on it showed that indeed Malami had accessed his Twitter account with the aid of a VPN. See Also Politics REVEALED: How Malami Downloaded VPN, Logged Into Twitter To Deactivate Account\n\nThis is however not the first time the Minister would be disregarding laws made by the Buhari-led government despite being the Chief Law Officer of the country.\n\nHe has also been constantly accused of using his influence in the government to promote impunity and human rights violation.\n\nIn July 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols and guidelines were flouted during the wedding Fatiha of Malami\u2019s son, Abdulaziz, to Khadija Danbatta as guests were seen in a video dancing and communicating close to one another without wearing face masks.\n\nThe Minister was also seen in the video spraying wads of cash at the event, against the rule of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which forbids anyone from abusing the naira by spraying and stepping on them in public. See Also Politics Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami, Buys Multi-million Naira Mansion For Newly Married Son, Guests Flout Social Distancing Guidelines During Lavish Wedding Ceremony\n\nThe lavish ceremony did not only breach the laid down protocols of the NCDC but also violated the stipulated number of persons approved to attend a social event at that time by the Nigerian government.\n\nNot only did participants at the ceremony, which took place inside the Kano State Government House, more than 20, many of them did not wear face masks to protect themselves and others from contracting Coronavirus.\n\nAlso, the large number of top serving and former government officials including leading players in various industries from across the country present at the ceremony showed that indeed more than a few private jets touched down in Kano on the date for the event.\n\nFindings by SaharaReporters further revealed that a former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, former Zamfara governor, Abdul'aziz Abubakar Yari, incumbent governor of Sokoto and Zamfara states, Aminu Tambuwal and Bello Muhammad Matawalle, were among dignitaries that graced the occasion with their entourage.\n\nA former Speaker of Borno State House of Assembly, Goni Ali Modu, House of Representatives Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, Minister of Power, Engr Sale Mamman, and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kolo Kyari, are among other top functionaries present at the wedding inside the Kano State Government House.\n\nCuriously, ex-Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, who was arraigned in court on May 5 this year by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for alleged N714 million fraud also attended the elaborate ceremony in Kano on Saturday.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the wedding ceremony also turned out to be a nightmare for motorists and commuters in Kano, one of the busiest cities in Northern Nigeria, who woke up to the sight of armed security personnel barricading roads in key locations within the metropolis.\n\nIn separate reports, SaharaReporters had revealed how Malami bought a N300 million mansion for his son and wife in Abuja as gift in addition to another N100 million property in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State constructed under less than two months.\n\nPersons close to the AGF, told SaharaReporters that since being appointed into the government of President Muhammadu Buhari in November 2015, Malami, a lawyer not well known before then, had embarked on a relentless purchase and construction of property through alleged public funds.",

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami Shielded Indian-Muslim Family Accused Of Over N600 Billion Graft\u2014Report",
          "text": "Members of famous Indian family the Sandesaras, indicted or on the run for tax evasion, loan fraud, and other alleged offences enjoy state protection from Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria, says an investigative report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThe Sandesaras\u2014Chetankumar, his wife Diptiben, and elder brother Nitin had been on the run since 2017, when authorities in India accused them of defrauding local banks out of loans worth over $700 million at the time.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nDespite the allegations and their fugitive status, the family had been allowed to invest in projects in Albania, Kosovo, and Nigeria. In fact, they hold Albanian and Nigerian passports.\n\nThe OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India. Police reports, court documents, interviews, and flight data obtained by reporters show how these officials allowed the family to move freely and continue to run their businesses while at large.\n\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\n\nDocuments obtained by OCCRP also show that Indian state companies continued to buy hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil sourced from the Sandesaras\u2019 Nigerian firm after the family went on the run - implying that the family yet maintains ties with some state authorities in India.\n\nThe family owns Nigeria-based Sterling Oil Exploration and Energy Production Company (SEEPCO).\n\nThe brothers\u2014Nitin Sandesara and Chetankumar Sandesara\u2014control some 340 companies, including 92 outside India in energy, construction, and healthcare. Their conglomerate has claimed to be worth nearly $7 billion.\n\nAs their wealth grew, the family became a staple of the Indian tabloids, which gushed about their extravagant properties, lavish parties, and appearances with Bollywood stars. In one anecdote, Chetankumar reportedly complained to journalists when a media portal underestimated the cost of the family\u2019s new jet.\n\nBut the Sandesaras\u2019 fortunes shifted in the fall of 2017 when the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi accused them and their company of cheating and criminal conspiracy. A subsequent investigation by the Indian government\u2019s Enforcement Directorate claimed that their Sterling Biotech group had criminally acquired and laundered over $700 million for the benefit of its \u201cpromoters,\u201d including the Sandesara brothers and Diptiben.\n\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks. In 2019, the amount those banks declared as fraudulent had risen to over $1.1 billion (about N600 billion).\n\nMuch of this money was allegedly siphoned off using shell companies which listed employees and associates of Sterling Biotech as their shareholders and directors. Prosecutors say the money was transferred under the guise of asset purchases and property transactions. These transactions were also allegedly used to inflate the balance sheets of the shell companies, which then borrowed even more money from the banks and diverted those funds as well.\n\nThe Sandesaras also appear to have played politics in Kosovo. In February 2019, Kosovo\u2019s then Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj posted on Facebook that he had met with Chetankumar Sandesara, describing him as a \u201crepresentative of \u2018Sandesara Group\u2019 from Nigeria,\u201d to discuss investments in tourism and agriculture.\n\nThey have found shelter in Nigeria, along with lucrative business opportunities.\n\nIn 2011, SEEPCO partnered with Nigerian-owned Allenne Energy Ltd. on a concession licence to exploit an oil field worth over $3 billion. Nigeria\u2019s then-president Goodluck Jonathan named Sterling as one of the country\u2019s top 100 businesses in 2014.\n\nThe accusations against them back home do not seem to have troubled Nigerian officials. A month after they were charged in India, Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs between 2016 and 2018, wrote to the Albanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking for Nitin Sandesara to be appointed honorary consul to Nigeria. She cited Nitin\u2019s \u201ceffort to expand the friendship\u201d between Nigeria and Albania and \u201cthe need to provide [an] avenue for boosting trade and investment relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nAlbanian authorities immediately began the process, and Nitin received the position in January 2019, a year after he and his brother received their Albanian citizenship.\n\nIn June 2018, Nigeria\u2019s judiciary also handed down a ruling that reinforced the narrative that the Sandesaras had faced persecution by Indian authorities. The decision was made as part of a suit filed by Allenne Energy to prevent information about the Nigerian oil concession from being shared with any law enforcement agencies or banks in India or Nigeria.\n\nAllenne\u2019s suit alleged that the Indian banks were acting with \u201culterior motives\u201d and asked the court for a declaration that the \u201cchange of government in India as well as the government policies and political and religious victimization and persecution of [SEEPCO] constitute force majeure capable of raising concerns by [Allenne Energy] in protecting its interest.\u201d\n\nA judge in Nigeria\u2019s Federal High Court agreed, writing that the Sandesara brothers and their families were being \u201ctargeted by Indian government agencies\u201d for their political and religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt would be inappropriate for this court to allow any Nigerian company to be economically imperiled, because of political vendetta of Indian Government and banks,\u201d the judge\u2019s statement read. \u201cNigeria is keen on keeping and protecting the present legitimate investors and to even encourage more to come into the economy.\u201d\n\nLater, in 2019, Nigeria\u2019s justice ministry made a similar argument when it rejected a request from India to extradite members of the Sandesara family, citing its power to refuse requests if it believes that the offence is \u201cpolitical in nature.\u201d\n\nPrashant Bhushan, the prominent public interest lawyer in India, called the High Court\u2019s decision \u201claughable,\u201d and pointed out that the Sandesaras are close to a former top Central Bureau of Investigation officer, R.K. Asthana, whose daughter\u2019s wedding was held in their farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSomeone who is so close to Asthana cannot fear persecution by the Indian government,\u201d said Bhushan, who in late 2017 made public a diary belonging to the Sandesaras that allegedly detailed kickbacks to top Indian officials. \u201cA sham show is being put on to show that an attempt to extradite them is being made.\u201d\n\nWhether or to what extent the Sandesaras have been protected in India is a matter of debate. Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

Indian authorities have reportedly sought to freeze over $2 billion worth of Sandesara assets as part of their investigation.\n\nBut oil shipping data provided to OCCRP also shows that state-run Indian companies continued buying Nigerian crude sourced from SEEPCO even after the money laundering charges against the Sandesaras, raising questions about how hard the Indian state and the defrauded banks are working to reclaim the money they allege the family stole.\n\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well. A copy of both this case and the decision by Nigeria not to extradite the four family members were given to the Tirana District Court by a special envoy of the Nigerian government.\n\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",
          "summary": "The OCCRP investigation says high-ranking Albanian and Nigerian officials helped the family evade repeated attempts to extradite them to India.\nNigeria's Attorney-General rebuffed an Indian request for their extradition, arguing that the case appeared to be politically motivated.\nInvestigators claimed that the family\u2019s companies had obtained the money by fraudulently obtaining loans from various Indian banks.\nThe Nigerian court decision in the case filed by Allenne, handed down on June 8, 2018, ultimately helped the Sandesaras avoid extradition from Albania as well.\nRejecting to order extradition, an Albanian judge argued that Nigeria\u2019s High Court had shown the Sandesara family were being targeted because of their \u201cpolitical and religious beliefs.\u201d",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Apple\u2019s planned privacy safety feature won\u2019t roll out in three censorship-heavy African countries",
          "text": "This year\u2019s edition of Apple\u2019s annual software developer conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), kicked off on Monday with a roughly 90-minute keynote address that saw top company executives show off a slew of new updates for major products.\n\nKey announcements made by the American technology giant included software for iPhone, Mac, iPad, Watch and Apple TV, new health features, and updates to Siri, AirPods, and iCloud. In addition to these, Apple unveiled new updates focused on tightening the protection of its users\u2019 privacy.\n\nA particular update that stood out from Apple\u2019s several privacy-focused measures is \u201cPrivate Relay\u201d. This new feature encrypts all browsing history and prevents third parties from intercepting the communication between your device and the server you\u2019re requesting information from. When turned on, nobody can track a user\u2019s online activity \u2013 not even the internet service provider or Apple itself. This is due to the fact that the feature uses a server maintained by a third-party operator, which will assign temporary IP addresses for users as they browse the internet.\n\nApple\u2019s use of an outside party in the relay system is intentional to prevent even the company from knowing both the user\u2019s identity and what website the user is visiting, it explained.\n\nPrivate relay is the latest in a string of efforts by Apple meant to curb the tracking of its users\u2019 browsing activity by ISPs, advertisers, and other third parties. The feature is likely to go live later this year but Apple has revealed that it won\u2019t be available in some countries due to \u201cregulatory reasons\u201d.\n\nCountries where the company will not offer private relay include South Africa, Egypt, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, the Philippines and China. In the latter, users live under a vast surveillance system and notorious internet censorship, and Apple has had to make several compromises on privacy to meet the demands of the ruling Communist party.\n\nIt is unsurprising to see African countries on the list of nations excluded from the private relay rollout as cutting off access to the internet and social media is common in the region.

          "title": "Exposure to risk: What tech investors fear and find interesting about Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban",
          "text": "For the second time in six months, a major government announcement is causing startup founders and investors to ponder the effect of politics and sudden regulation on doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIn February, it was the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. This time it is the ban on Twitter, a social media platform that has been used for everything from crowdsourcing pro-bono lawyers for people in distress and finding missing persons, to raising capital.\n\nOn January 11 this year, the Cowrywise team received a direct message from Sahil Lavingia, a tech entrepreneur and angel investor from Silicon Valley. He had learned about the savings and wealth management startup and wanted to invest, so he reached out the best way he could \u2013 via Twitter.\n\nTwo weeks and two days later, Cowrywise closed a $3 million pre-seed round. It was led by Quona Capital, a multinational investment firm, with Lavingia and other investors participating.\n\n\u201cThe power of Twitter,\u201d Lavingia declared after the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this DM was just perfect\u2026\u201d Razaq Ahmed, Cowrywise\u2019s CEO, said.\n\nIn a different decade, startup fundraising in Africa involved long-distance travels. Primed by stories of fake companies and phantom Nigerian princes, investors needed to physically verify business authenticity, assess startup-investor chemistry and speak to customers.\n\nIn 2021, investing in Nigeria can take one DM. But this ease and perfection is now under threat.\n\nOne less medium for investor contact\n\nAfter the government ban on Twitter last week, a number of startups are anxious about using the platform.\n\nMost have suspended customer support on Twitter, while some have disclaimed that their accounts are operated outside Nigeria.\n\nThe anxiety around the ban has gotten to the international community of startup investors too.\n\nAs providers of capital, investors influence the pace and scale of innovation. Often, their decision to do so is based on perceptions about the business environment. What are they feeling and fearing about Nigeria now?\n\nIdo Sum, a partner at TLCom Capital, says the ban \u201cmay put a dampener on some foreign investments for tech companies in the short term but this is unlikely to be sustained.\u201d\n\nNigeria grabs attention for being the most populous country in Africa, with 200 million people. That number doesn\u2019t necessarily speak to the opportunity size for every startup; after all, the country\u2019s 40% poverty rate is the highest in the world.\n\n\n\nBut 81% of the country\u2019s 106 million adults have mobile phones and broadband penetration is at 40.6% \u2013 a vast improvement from 19.69% in June 2017. A growing supply of high-quality tech entrepreneurs, including from former employees of startups like Paystack and Andela, is fuelling the rise of more startups each year.\n\nSum, whose firm has invested in uLesson, Okra and Terragon among others, believes investors will continue to focus on this trend.\n\nAs the general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures, Satoshi Shinada is constantly watching the 89 companies they have invested in across 11 countries. He\u2019s had to pay particular attention to their Nigeria portfolio \u2013 which includes Decagon, Lifestores Pharmacy, Bamboo and BuyCoins \u2013 following a flurry of regulatory actions this year.\n\n\u201cI think the ban on Twitter will definitely affect investor sentiments and perception about Nigeria negatively, especially foreign investors who invest in Nigeria remotely,\u201d Shinada says.\n\nAs he describes it, Twitter has been a medium for such investors to establish contacts and engage in conversations that illuminate the market opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, he thinks that the impact will be minimal. With Nigerians finding alternative paths to retain access to Twitter, it shows that the market is resilient, keeping the investment corridor open for business.\n\nTwo other tech investors who spoke to TechCabal largely agreed with this view of the Twitter ban\u2019s possible effect on foreign investments into tech startups.\n\nFive days after internet service providers turned off the Twitter switch, the site is still being accessed through VPNs. Therefore, DMs remain open for communication between prospective investors and founding teams. It helps that such chats are never public unless one party divulges conversation history.\n\nBut even in terms of communication, other avenues exist. Email and then WhatsApp remain the major channels for hashing out term sheet details, one investor said. Zoom calls and regular phone conversations still work.\n\nMore discount on regulatory risk\n\nOne area of investment concern following the Twitter ban is \u201ca higher sense of political and regulatory risk,\u201d where unilateral decisions can put whole companies in jeopardy.\n\nBeyond assessing Nigerian startups on market size and tech gadgets penetration, there will now be a need to put a lot more discount on potential returns by taking political risk into account.\n\nBut if investors have to put a lot more political-risk discount on potential returns, would that not increase their scepticism to invest in the first place?\n\nIt would, for firms who find that the adjusted returns do not fit their investment strategy. Where a firm sets its Internal Rate of Return at 40% and gets 20% after factoring in these risks, it would be inclined to decline such opportunities.\n\nWhat that does is that an investor served with a similar opportunity in a lower-risk market, say Ghana, may likely fund the Ghanaian startup instead.\n\nThat said, investors who write million-dollar tickets and have taken a long-term view of their play in Nigeria will likely not be turned off by such discounts.\n\n\u201cFor investors like ourselves who are focused on Africa for the long term, this has no effect, and we hope that this will be the case for non Africa based investors as well, who will keep seeing the great long term potential and upside and keep increasing their exposure to the African tech ecosystem,\u201d says Sum, the TLCom Capital partner.\n\nHe also hopes that the Nigerian government will realise that bans have not worked and seek collaborations and partnerships with the \u201cvery influential\u201d tech community as a path forward.",

          "title": "Femi Iromini is improving the employability of students in Nigeria",
          "text": "Femi Iromini has been active in the African tech ecosystem for the past 5 years. As a young student, he ran many businesses\u2014 at one point, he performed due diligence for foreign investors looking to invest in African startups. Now he\u2019s focused on improving the Nigerian education system and the employability of Nigerian graduates.\n\nTo understand how he got here, let\u2019s look at his life\u2019s journey.\n\nReading Gifted Hands by Ben Carson at an early age sparked Iromini\u2019s interest in medicine. This interest was also encouraged by his secondary school teachers. He was the best student in chemistry, physics and maths so naturally, they all thought he would do well to study medicine.\n\nHe secured admission into the university and had begun studying medicine for some months before his father pulled him out of school.\n\n\u201cHe just told me that he didn\u2019t think the school was meant for me,\u201d Iromini told me.\n\nFortunately, Iromini got into university at a young age so taking an involuntary gap year wasn\u2019t too big a deal.\n\nSwitching to Geophysics\n\nIromini\u2019s switch to geophysics is a story that many may relate with. It involves a rich uncle and a desire to be as rich as the said uncle.\n\nOne day, while he was at home, this uncle came around. As they played chess, Iromini asked him what he did for a living. He worked with the oil company ExxonMobil and he had studied geophysics.\n\nIromini recalled, \u201cWhen my uncle mentioned geophysics, I thought to myself, \u2018This must be God speaking to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the career prospects of geophysics looking promising, he decided to study geophysics.\n\nA year into studying geophysics at Obafemi Awolowo University, he started questioning whether he had made the right choice.\n\nThe answer to that question came during a field trip to Ekiti. The students and lecturer had gone out to identify some rocks and minerals.\n\n\u201cDuring this field trip, a professor leading the delegates carried a boulder. I could see he was passionate about it. He then said if you really want to succeed as a geologist you need to fall in love with rocks. You need to romance rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was at the back, watching and listening. I didn\u2019t find that appealing. I told myself there are better things in life to romance than rocks.\u201d\n\nNone of his lecturers back at school were passionate about rocks and they didn\u2019t answer field questions with certainty. By the end of the trip, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to end up in a career related to geophysics.\n\nThat trip became a turning point for him and pushed him to attend a variety of non-academic events. He got into a number of social impact and entrepreneurial programs like the One Young World, Goldman Sachs Program, World Business Dialogue and Global University Initiative. These programs expanded his mind and opened him up to a world of possibilities.\n\nContributing to society through business\n\nDuring one of these programs, his life took a turn after Nelson Mandela charged him and other participants to focus on changing Africa by looking for ways to contribute.\n\nHe returned from the program and started businesses in school. He opened a laundry business and restaurants on three campuses. He also started a social enterprise that helped students get internships.\n\nAs he built these businesses, other students supported him. Back then, he didn\u2019t know anything about financing. He just wrote a letter soliciting contributions from his peers and they showed up. He bought his first washing machine after a \u20a620,000 ($125 at the time) contribution came in from another student.\n\nDespite the initial support he was fortunate enough to receive, he realised it was difficult to get the additional financial support he needed to build his businesses. The traditional funding channels weren\u2019t a viable option because the business didn\u2019t have a track record.\n\nDuring this phase he stumbled on Kickstarter \u2013 a crowdfunding platform. At the time, it was a new idea that opened up his mind to the concept that people can leverage their social capital to raise funds. His businesses thrived because other people believed and supported him, so he wanted to build a similar platform for others around him to raise funds.\n\nTo build this platform he collaborated with some Indian engineers he met during a program he attended years before. Building the platform took longer than expected and he spent more money than he planned to.\n\nTo increase the pace of development, he learnt a bit of coding and joined in building the platform.\n\nEventually, Crowdy, a platform that helped people in his community raise funds from family and friends, was launched. Its fundraising process was similar to the rolling fund investment model.\n\nIn 2014, fresh out of school and still running the Crowdy platform, he was approached by AXA Venture Partners, they needed help in deal analysis and sourcing for African startups.\n\n\u201cThey were looking to invest in Africa, but they weren\u2019t sure about the numbers. With Crowdy we were able to aggregate startups, especially in East Africa for them. We were more like deal aggregators.\u201d\n\nIromini and his team at Crowdy helped conduct due diligence on the startups they referred to AXA Venture Partners, they were paid for the consulting services they offered.\n\nWhile at Crowdy, Iromini also partnered with the cofounding team for the first few months of the formation of agritech company Farmcrowdy.\n\nPreparing students for employment\n\nIn 2013, while still running Crowder he enrolled in an post graduate program in innovation and entrepreneurship at Stanford University. During the program, he spent a lot of time around the Stanford campus and other neighbouring universities. He noticed a common denominator that was missing back home. In every university, there was a career center. The schools were intentional about preparing students for the world of employment.\n\nComparing this approach with his undergraduate days where there was no structure around preparing students for employment, he decided to do something about this problem.\n\n\u201cUniversities should be thinking about career outcomes. How many [of their] graduates are employed, unemployed or furthering their education. Career outcomes are a selling proposition for universities,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nThis led to the creation of Lead 360, an education technology company. The company has worked with a number of public and private universities like Covenant University and Afe Babalola.\n\nBased on the few engagements Lead 360 had with these universities, they learned that it\u2019s more than just establishing a career centre in these schools. Making students more employable requires a step by step approach.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s typically found is that in many of these schools, in the final year, a one-week seminar on employability will be organised. You\u2019re meant to have a career advisor whose performance is based on the successful employment of students. Someone who helps with internships, reviewing CVs and evaluating the interests of students,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nAs opposed to engaging with governments and universities directly, Lead 360 has adjusted its model to focus on working with institutions like the World Bank and the International Labour Organisation first, then using them to engage with the governments and universities. It has proven to be more effective.\n\nThey\u2019ve successfully collaboration with the state governments and corporate organisations to develop over 40 digital centres like one in Makoko, Yaba, Lagos.\n\nLead 360 is working on a few projects right now. Top on the list is a labour market information system. A system that informs the government and universities on what skillsets employers are looking for and how many students have these skillsets in real time. This project is funded by international agencies.\n\nIt also has other solutions for students like career services, a learning management system, a transcript management system, and an education financing product.\n\nAs someone who has always sought to solve problems around him, Iromini is taking the Nigerian education system heads on.\n\nBy 2050, Africa is going to have a large population with Nigeria at the forefront, he is constantly asking himself, \u201cwhat are we going to do with this population?\u201d",

          "text": "It\u2019s a revolutionary feature that helps clients evaluate and choose Master Traders\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a popular service that allows clients to profit by copying trades from professional traders, also known as Master Traders. The company recently introduced Risk Score\u2014a game-changing feature that enables copiers to choose Master Traders based on the risk of their trading strategy.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading is a top-rated service among the company\u2019s clients. There are two great reasons for its popularity. First, you can access the service with just one tap through the OctaFX Copytrading app or the desktop version. Second, you need zero Forex expertise to start making a profit.\n\nWondering how it works? The clients, known as copiers, choose professional traders, known as Master Traders, to copy their trades. Whenever a Master Trader opens an order, the same order opens in a copier\u2019s account automatically. That way, a copier can simply trust a Master Trader\u2019s expertise and profit with minimum effort.\n\nHowever, it is important to choose a Master Trader wisely and invest your funds securely. For this reason, OctaFX offers a Master Rating, where the best traders are placed at the top. Previously, they were evaluated only by their profitability and popularity. Now OctaFX took it to the next level.\n\nOctaFX Copytrading introduced Risk Score\u2014a new feature that shows how risky each Master Trader\u2019s strategy is. The score is calculated by a special algorithm and depends on a Master Trader\u2019s average profit, number of orders, and how stable their strategy is. The introduction of Risk Score is fundamental because copiers can now choose a Master Trader based not only on their profit but also on their strategy. Master Traders who score 1 or 2 on a 6-point scale apply more stable, long-term oriented, and less risky strategies.\n\nOctaFX hopes that with this new feature, their copy trading clients will be able to choose Master Traders who best suit their preferences.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2021 \u2018Best Forex Broker Asia\u2019 award and the 2020 \u2018Most Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "In May 2021, CribMD, a Nigerian healthtech startup, closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based venture capital firm, Sputnik ATX.\n\nFounded by Dr Oksana Malysheva \u2014 a physicist with stints at McKinsey and Motorola \u2014 and Joe Merrill \u2014 a former US diplomat to Nigeria, South Korea, and Bosnia \u2014 Sputnik ATX runs an accelerator programme where founders receive $100,000, with the potential for more in follow-on funding.\n\nSince its inception, the firm has invested in over 30 startups across various industries.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Joe Merrill, a partner at the firm, and he gave some insights into how they invest in startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: Sputnik is a Russian word meaning partner. It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.\n\nFeatured image credit: Supplied",

Click smeclinic.techpoint.africa for details. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nPossible Twitter negotiations with the Nigerian government\n\nAndroid 12 beta 2 launch and Apple iOS 15\u2019s features\n\nTwitter reaches out to the Nigerian government for negotiations\n\nNigeria\u2019s online space has been abuzz since the government announced the suspension of microblogging and social media platform, Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, according to Channels Television, Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says Twitter has reached out to the government to negotiate. He made the statement on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, while addressing the State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nThe Minister added that the suspension has been effective, saying Twitter has made significant losses since the ban.\n\nNothing from Twitter: However, the social media platform has kept mum about negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the company, via its Public Policy account on June 5, 2021, said that the platform would \u201cwork to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAsk Malami? When Mohammed was questioned about the section of the law that prosecutes Nigerians who continue to use Twitter, he referred journalists to the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s comment.\n\nTwitter should pay tax too: The Minister discussed the Federal Government\u2019s move to ensure social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, et al. \u2014 are registered in the country and pay tax for the billions they earn.\n\n\u201cQuiz 1: How many topics did we discuss in the first edition? Mention two.\u201d\n\nOn a non-Twitter related note, Apple has announced the new features coming to its new iOS 15.\n\nThe announcement was made during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The event, dedicated to software, is held annually to showcase new features coming to operating systems across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition kicked off Monday, June 7, and will end Friday, June 11, 2021.\n\nFaceTime, a feature known to be exclusive to iOS devices, will now work outside the ecosystem; it will include options to share screens like video conferencing platform, Zoom. The new operating system will continue Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature that started with the previous upgrade.\n\nAnother interesting feature coming to the new iOS is Live Text. The iPhone camera will now be able to recognise text within an image. So, texts \u2014 phone numbers, words, symbols \u2014 in an image can be copied and saved.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: While this feature is new to iOS, it bears a close resemblance to Google Lens on Android devices, which can translate and save text from an image using the camera. However, whatever upgrades Apple has introduced to this feature will be ascertained when the operating system launches officially.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Apple\u2019s WWDC here.\n\n\u201cQuiz 2: If you noticed, Emmanuel and Oluwanifemi did something different with previous Thursday editions. What was the first topic in this trend?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Android, Google has released the second beta version of its latest operating system, Android 12. Launched Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the second version will come with more of the features promised at the Google I/O event in May.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Google will bring more beta testers on board with the Android 12 beta 2 release. They will be testing out features like the new privacy dashboard, Quick Setting toggle, and Internet Panels that make switching between Internet providers easy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to install the developer beta of iOS 15. Read.\n\nWhat Should You Send a VC Before Your Meeting? Read.\n\nHave a beautiful day.",

          "title": "We will deal ruthlessly with those causing unrest in Nigeria",

You will see that there will be a difference in coming weeks,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe president also spoke on issues bordering on infrastructural development, unemployment, 2023 election, and many other.\n\nBuhari said the people of the North-West are one, yet they are killing each other. He said the situation was giving him concern as the people of the North-West were suffering a lot of casualties.\n\nHe said two South-West governors approached him saying that some farmers were killed by herders, but he asked them to go back and re-arrange their security networks.\n\nHe said in the First Republic, herders had the grazing routes and those whose animals grazed on people\u2019s farms were arrested.\n\nRead Also: Buhari to declare maiden edition of APC youth conference open\n\n\u201cI asked people to go back to the First Republic and dig out the gazette. There were grazing routes and grazing areas. When they were moving North to South or South to North, they moved through grazing areas. If they moved through people\u2019s farms, they were arrested,\u201d he said, noting that grazing areas in those days had facilities and even veterinaries.\n\nThe president also defended his appointments, which many see as lopsided in favour of a section of the country.\n\nBuhari said all the appointments he makes are strictly based on merit and not based on ethnic or regional balance.\n\nBut he would not speak on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria which has generated a lot of heated debate.\n\n\u201cI will keep that to myself,\u201d Buhari said.",

          "text": "As at 9 o\u2019clock Wednesday night, the normal queue of trucks in and out of Apapa had disappeared. The round the clock, seven days a week chaos that has become a major feature of Apapa, causing hours of unending traffic jams, was gone. Also, security, up till now, is tight in Lagos.\n\nThe reason for this unusual development in Apapa, Nigeria\u2019s port city and economic hub, which has become a metaphor for stress and suffering, is because President Muhammadu Buhari is expected in Lagos on today.\n\nThis is the second time Apapa is experiencing a gridlock-free day following the visit of President Buhari. The first was in 2019 when Buhari, as presidential candidate, visited the Lagos to canvass for votes.\n\nThe implication of all these is that Apapa can work again if those who have the power also have the will. It speaks volumes of what is possible not just with Apapa, but also the mess that defines Nigeria as nation. It is curious why somebody thinks Buhari shouldn\u2019t see the chaos Apapa has become.\n\nRead Also: Apapa gridlock: Hope alive three months after deploying call up technology\n\nAll the committees, task-forces and task teams, including a Presidential Task Team on Apapa Gridlock which had the vice president as chairman, failed in their assignments because they were mere smokescreen and cosmetic arrangements never aimed to succeed.\n\nWhile in Lagos, Buhari will be inaugurating the 157-kilometre Lagos-Ibadan standard rail project at the Mobolaji Johnson railway station in Ebutte Metta.\n\nThereafter, the president is expected to proceed to the Energy Nature Light Terminal of the Apapa Port to further commission the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, otherwise known as the Deep Blue Project.\n\nPresidential aide, Bashir Ahmad had on Wednesday noted that his principal would be in the nation\u2019s commercial capital for the commissioning.\n\n\u201cConstruction started in March 2017, and test-running commenced in December 2020,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page; the Ebute Metta Station, known as the Mobolaji Johnson Station, is the largest railway station in West Africa with a holding capacity of 6000 passengers.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is committed to developing a modern national railway network that will connect every part of Nigeria, and promote trade, travel, tourism, commerce and national integration,\u201d Ahmad noted.\n\nBuhari is expected back at the State House later on today after the inauguration of the projects.\n\nThe 156km Lagos\u2014Ibadan standard gauge railway line in Lagos is the first double-track standard gauge rail in West Africa. It is also the first Nigerian railway line to be started and finished by the same government, since 1960.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, had earlier explained that the projects was primarily aimed at ensuring the seamless movement of cargoes from the Apapa Seaport via train to further decongest the ports.",

The company is also partnering with safety institutions such as World Safety Organisation (WSO) and Institute of Safety Professionals of Nigeria (ISPON) to sensitise the public against vandalism of power infrastructure.\n\nAt the event, BEDC was honoured with a Merit Award of Excellence for its valuable contribution to environmental safety by the organisers.",

If we allow hunger to permeate the whole society, the government will be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. So we warn them.

Who would go and invest in such an environment? Nobody. It is just common sense.\n\n\u201dI told them to tell the youths if they want jobs they should behave themselves, make Nigeria secure so that people can come and invest. Nigeria is resourceful, everybody knows that God has really endowed us.\u201d\n\nBuhari passing the security buck back to the governors said governors having security issues in their states should not just sit back after winning elections and expect people to do their jobs for them.\n\nHe advised them to revert to the traditional ways of tackling insecurity by involving traditional institutions and community leaders that are very effective at the local level.\n\nAccording to the President, the governors should be able to tackle these security situations because they have \u201cvery effective traditional institutions\u201d and security systems at the state and local levels.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo SW Governors came to me to say cattle rearers are destroying farms in their states, I asked them what happened to the grassroots security panels from Traditional Rulers to Local Governments who meet regularly to identify the root of their problems and identify crooks within their environment. Who destroyed this system? Go back and fix it, give your people a sense of belongings. I don\u2019t like it when people campaign to become Governors and people trusted them with their votes and after winning, they can\u2019t perform, they\u2019re trying to push responsibilities to others. We have three tiers of Government, Federal, State and Local. We have killed the Local Government totally. We will send N300m as allocation to a Local Government, one Governor will ask the LG Chairman to sign that he collected N300m but he will give him N100m and the Chairman will keep quiet\u2026..is that how we will continue???\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President, Muhammadu Buhari has fiercely defended his largely presumed lopsided appointments across the Nigerian Government sphere, insisting that Nigerians have not been fair to him in their judgment.\n\nBuhari who took this stand while speaking in an interview with Arise TV on Thursday, posited that positions in his government has to be earned with years of service and performance.\n\nOn appointments in the military, Buhari said: \u201cThese positions have to earned, some of these people have been there for 15 or 10 years. You have to pass through the ranks. You cannot just pick someone just because he is wearing a uniform with a senior rank. You pick someone who has worked with the soldiers on the field, whom they know and trust\u201d.\n\nIn the case of several Army Generals billed for forced retirement over the appointment of a new Army Chief, the President said: \u201cDo you know where he was serving before he became Chief of Army Staff? Maiduguri in Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\n\u201cYou look at the NNPC, you look at the military, people who have been there for 15 or 10 years, they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta and they came through the ranks. They served under all the circumstances and crises, and they gradually rose to the status and you think we will just pick someone just to balance up? It has to be earned\u201d.\n\nOn his controversial tweet on treating \u201ctrouble makers in the language they understand\u201d, he insisted that \u201cwe will organize the military and the police to pursue them. That is what we can do, and we will do it\u201d.\n\nRefusing to comment on the Twitter ban controversy, Buhari simply said \u201cthat (Twitter) I will give to myself\u201d.\n\nThe President further argued that corruption is not being swept under the carpet in his administration as being speculated, stressing that \u201cNigerians have being unfair to him\u201d.\n\nOn allegations of building infrastructures from Northern Nigeria into Niger, Buhari insisted that it will be good for Nigeria, as Niger would now prefer to carry their products through Nigeria instead of Benin.\n\n\u201cHow many neighbours we have? You have to carry your neighbours along so you don\u2019t be in trouble. If we had not being in a good relationship with Niger, Chad and Cameroon, Boko Haram would have finished us,\u201d he added.\n\nSounding more threatening, Buhari said the North West would receive his fire-power very soon. \u201cI am convinced we have done well in the North East and in the South South. But I am being overwhelmed by the North West, but they will have it soon,\u201d Buhari threatened.\n\nBuhari apparently referring to youths in the South East, advised leaders at the state and local government levels to \u201ctell their youths that if they want jobs, they should behave themselves, because no one will invest in an insecure environment\u201d.\n\nHe also called for deliberate synergy between the Nigerian Customs and the Nigerian Immigration Service to fight the persistent trend of smuggling of petroleum products across Nigerian borders.\n\nWhile stating that he will continue to convince Nigerians that he doing well, President Buhari noted that he would retire back to his farm in Daura to take care of his cows after retirement from the Villa in 2023.",

          "text": "Business development experts have identified lack of adequate knowledge and requisite skills in chosen fields as factors responsible for the untimely death of most startup businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThe experts pointed out that most small scale entrepreneurs in the country go into businesses without being armed with the basic fundamentals and rudiments of the business they want to invest in, and as such, when they run into trouble waters, they have swept away in the tide, losing all their investments in the process.\n\nSpeaking at a two-day workshop organized by She4She Initiative, a not-for-profit Non-Governmental Organization, NGO, established to develop, empower and support women and the girl-child to attain self-dependency and sufficiency, Mr Olalekan Brahim, a business coach and founder Centre for Learning, CfL, emphasized that Knowledge of the business is the first capital to acquire and not money.\n\nIbrahim maintained that the mistake most people make is to go for money first believing once they have money, they can go into any business they want.\n\nHe said, \u201cKnowledge is the first thing, not money. But the mistake people do is go for money first. When you have the knowledge, money becomes tools for you, but if you have money without knowledge you will waste the money.\u201d\n\nThe business coach noted that beyond whatever one might have heard about entrepreneurship as a means of doing business, there are still certain critical facts to consider entrepreneurship before venturing into it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about entrepreneurship, we know it\u2019s doing business, but there are things we don\u2019t consider on entrepreneurship. We don\u2019t consider the problem first.\n\n\u201cMaybe you want to sell or render service, you have to realize it\u2019s problem you are trying to solve. Once you determine the problem, you will be able to know the solution. You have to understand the problem, the customer, once you know the problem you be able to determine those who are carrying the problem and you be able to understand how you can find solutions to it.\n\n\u201cOnce you are able to establish this, you will be able to do analysis: am I really ready for this business? Do I have the right knowledge, resources, tools to do this?\n\nThe CEO of Centre for Learning advised every startup business owner to ensure they attend a workshop like this one put together by She4She in order to take advantage of opportunities like this.\n\nAlso speaking on Mental health and fitness development, Dr. Yomi Jaiye, a life coach and the founder of CECY Health, emphasized on the need for participants to develop their mindset to improve their creativity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to talk about mental wellness because wealth is a mindset. If you are able to develop your thinking, you can create anything in the world without needing anybody\u2019s help take your life from the lowest point to the top.\n\nIn her remarks, the founder of She4She Initiative, Barr. Oyanbo Peace Owei, said the essence of the 2-day training for empowerment of women and girls was to be able to impact their lives and to support women and girls so they can have access to quality health care, good education, personal development.\n\nBarr. Owei said, \u201cIt\u2019s a personal development training for women and girls child to be able to build themselves. \u201cWe looked at the statistics of unemployed, poor and deprived women, and out of school girl-child, we decided that we can not just fold our arms. After the adverse effect of the Covid-19 pandemic we decided to stand up for women and that\u2019s where the theme \u201cWomen Up\u201d meaning women stand up for women was coined from.\n\n\u201cWe want to use our platform and wealth of knowledge to let people know what they need to know to develop themselves. We also want to give them awareness about various government programmes and plans that are available for women that can benefit them that they are not aware of. We want to take this advocacy upon ourselves. We want to create positive impact in our society.\u201d\n\nThe workshop had in attendance over 200 participants who were drawn from the online platforms, and were taught how to develop and improve their businesses.\n\nOne of the participants, Felicia Anita, said, \u201cI learnt about entrepreneurship and public speaking. There are some mistakes I used to make during resume writing that I got to know they were actually the wrong. I ended up providing a Solution to the problem I didn\u2019t know was there in the first place.\n\nAnother participant said, Mercy Mikel Ogwuche, said, \u201cThe speaker we had yesterday taught us about public speaking and it was so helpful. I also learnt about entrepreneurship on how to set up my own business, my vision, mission and how to have market policy. I have my own business already, this will help me take my business to another level.\u201d",

The atmosphere within the KASU community has of late been intense, following certain government decisions that have not gone down well with the lecturers, students, and their parents.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Kaduna State Government decided to increase school fees at the tertiary institution, a hike that saw fees rise between 300 and 500 percent. This was a bitter pill to swallow for many students and their guardians who will now pay N150,000 per student, instead of N24,000 which used to be the minimum.\n\nREAD ALSO: KASU Students Block Road To Govt House In Protest Over Hike Tuition Fees\n\nEnraged by what they describe as an outrageous increase, students have continued to stage protests against the hike. The students have not been alone in this struggle, as their lecturers who are members of the ASUU joined in the protest, rejecting the tuition increase.\n\nReacting to this development, Osodeke described the situation as sad and terrible, especially at \u201cthis time when an average parent can hardly feed and can hardly take care their children\u201d.\n\nThe ASUU President further stated that he will stand by the students, adding that he hopes the parents and indigenes of Kaduna will rise up against the dictatorial attitude which is prevalent in El-Rufai\u2019s government.\n\nEl-Rufai has no right to direct KASU Vice-Chancellor to punish a staff\n\nSpeaking on the issue of lecturers allegedly sacked by the Kaduna State Government for participating in a protest organised by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Professor Osodeke said the Kaduna State Governor has no right to direct the KASU Vice-Chancellor to punish or sack staff.\n\nWhile noting that no ASUU member has been queried nor has anyone gotten a letter of dismissal, Osodeke said that a back-door sacking cannot be put past the Kaduna State Government.\n\nHe, however, stated that the ASUU branch in Kaduna has met with the KASU Vice-Chairman who denied that such an action has been taken by the university governing council.\n\nThe ASUU President stressed that Governor El-Rufai does not have any say in the recruitment and dismissal of a KASU staff, adding that it is purely in the purview of the governing board.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the governing council that recruits staff and can dismiss or punish a staff following the appropriate process laid down,\u201d Osodeke stressed.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government, represented by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) along with Togo, Burkina Faso and the Niger Republic on Wednesday commenced a high-level meeting in Abuja, to put final touches to the execution of a planned $570 million transmission line which runs across the four countries.\n\nSpeaking during the opening ceremony acting M,anaging Director of the TCN and Chairman, Executive Board of the West African Power Pool (WAPP), Mr. Sule Abdulaziz, disclosed that unused electricity within the country will be taken to the participating countries through the Northcore Power Transmission Line.\n\nHe noted that the question as to whether the country is selling its generated power to other countries when it doesn\u2019t have enough does not arise, noting that unutilised power generated daily will be exported to avoid waste.\n\nAccording to him, the project will be completed in about two years, with funding from international financial organisations in collaboration with the participating countries which will be disbursed after the contract signing ceremony.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe power we will be selling is the power that is not needed in Nigeria. These generators that are going to supply power to this transmission line are going to generate that power specifically for this project. So it is unutilised power.\u201d\n\nAbdulaziz noted that Nigeria is expecting new generators to participate in the energy export for the 875 kilometre 330 kilovolts transmission line from Nigeria through the three other countries, adding that jobs will be created while Nigeria will earn foreign exchange.\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn addition, there are some communities that are under the line route, about 611 of them, which will be getting power so that there won\u2019t be just a transmission line passing without impact.\u201d\n\nAbdulaziz said the project funded by World Bank, French Development Council and the African Development Bank (AfDB), has recorded progress and that the energy ministers will be addressing security issues for the project at a meeting in Abuja today.\n\n\u201cNigeria has the greatest advantage among these countries because the electricity is going to be exported from Nigerian Gencos. So, from that, the revenue is going to be enhanced and a lot of people will be employed in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his comments, the Secretary-General of WAPP, Appolinaire Ki said that when the facility becomes operational, there will be continuous feedstock, assuring that the funding agreement is ready as participating countries await the disbursement.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe cost is about $570 million and the part of the investment in each country is funded by the country and they are supported by the donors and Nigeria are taking its own.\n\n\u201cHowever, the donor agencies had said they needed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the buying and the selling countries to be executed before releasing the fund.\n\n\u201cSo, we will be addressing the ministers on this, so they can talk to the donors to remove this condition for disbursing the fund and let\u2019s go on with the implementation.\u201d\n\nThe WAPP executive noted that security was a major issue in the execution of the project, explaining that the body was discussing ways of incorporating the security agencies to mitigate threats that may be posed by criminals\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
