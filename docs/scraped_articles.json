          "text": "Justice Akintayo Aluko of the Federal High Court in Lagos State has ordered the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to obey an order seeking the release of a truck unlawfully seized and detained by the Divisional Police Officer and the Divisional Crime Officer of the Isolo Police Division, Lagos State, since December 21, 2020.\n\nJustice Aluko also ordered the IG to produce the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, and the other officers who were co-respondents in court for contempt proceedings over alleged violation of the court\u2019s order.\n\nIn suit FHC/L/CS/471/2021 filed by one Taju Alade, the IG, CP, DPO and DCO, Isolo; the Investigative Police Officer of the division, ASP Ganiyu, and the Nigeria Police Commission were respondents.\n\nAlade, a truck driver, commenced the suit before Justice M. A. Onyetenu on March 10, 2021, through his counsel, Love Okwuokei.\n\nHe averred that he was engaged by Crowd Appeal Nigeria Limited to convey paper materials from the Trade Fair area to Alagbado on December 21, 2020.\n\nHowever, on his way to deliver the goods, Alade stated that he observed electrical cables on Ago Road, Lagos, and to avoid running over a live wire, he pulled over and asked bystanders if it was safe to drive over the cables.\n\nThe applicant claimed that policemen from the Isolo Police Division arrested him on the allegation that he hit an electric pole with his truck.\n\nAlade stated that he was detained at the station for over 48 hours without being arraigned at the nearby magistrates or high courts, while his truck, with goods worth millions of naira inside, was seized.\n\nHe approached the court through an ex parte application and sought six prayers, including an order for the immediate release of the truck, N10m as general damages, and N500,000 as cost of the action.\n\nIn a ruling on March 26, Justice Onyetenu ordered the truck\u2019s release pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nShe further restrained the respondents from further arresting the applicant and interfering with his means of livelihood, or interfering with his right to liberty and freedom of movement.\n\nBut the respondents failed to comply following which the applicant initiated contempt proceedings against the police before Justice Aluko, to whom the case was transferred.\n\nAt the commencement of proceedings last Friday, the judge berated the police for disobeying the court order.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have gone through the records and found that the respondents have been duly served with the Certified True Copy of the order of this court which directed them to release the truck. I have also found that both Form 48 and 49 have been duly served on the IG and other respondents, even though there is evidence of service of the order of this court and Form 48 and 49 being served on the respondents. I don\u2019t want to conclude that the IG and the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, would wrongly flout the order of this court.\n\n\u201cI am sure that the IG and the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, are well aware of their responsibilities and duties under the constitution to enforce orders of this court in any part of the federation. For this reason, I will want to give the IG under whose supervision the Commissioner of Police and other respondents operates, the benefit of the doubt and another opportunity to act in compliance with the order of this court and Section 287(3) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I hereby order the IG to, without any further delay, act in compliance with the order of this court made on the 26th of March, 2021 and Section 287(3) of the Constitution and by so doing to produce the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, and other officers who are the co-respondents in court at the next adjourned date for them to show to the court why an order for committal should not be made against them for violating the order of this court without any justification.\u201d\n\nJustice Aluko further directed that the copy should be served on all the respondents and adjourned till December 7, 2021.\n\nThe judge ordered that the copy should be served on all the respondents and adjourned till December 7, 2021.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Needless to say, it cannot be allowed to stand or go unchallenged.\n\nFor the record, it is not true that President Obasanjo ever made such derogatory remarks about FFK to the effect that he is \u201ca good boy who will dance for food\u201d or anything close to it.\n\nEven though this fake news and the patently false and fabricated quote has been all over social media since 2013, we have ignored it.\n\nFake quotes attributed to high profile public figures are nothing new on social media but for a serious newspaper to use and legitimise them without any recourse to the purported author or attempt to verify their veracity is unacceptable.\n\nWe urge you to kindly publish this letter in order to set the record straight.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to hold you and your newspaper in the highest esteem and we wish you well.\n\n\u2022 Ndifreke Saviour-Mark, Senior Special Assistant to Chief Femi-Kayode, Abuja\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

IPOB is a global movement with members in over 100 countries and we know how we raise our funds. We don\u2019t solicit financial support from politicians. We have nothing to do with Nigerian politicians; we don\u2019t need their money!\n\n\u201cTherefore, anybody no matter how highly or lowly placed or even related to our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, parading as a representative of IPOB sent to collect financial support from any politician is on his or her own. Such impostors assuming the complaints are correct are scammers. They don\u2019t have the mandate of IPOB.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, seriously warn anybody swindling unsuspecting or greedy politicians in the name of IPOB to immediately disembark from such scandalous mission or brace up for the dire consequences. If we catch anybody no matter who such a one is, fronting as an IPOB agent before any Nigerian politician, such a person will live in regrets the rest of his or her life if the one is lucky to escape the wrath of God.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to advise gullible and greedy politicians not to deal with or give money to anyone claiming to have been sent by IPOB. We have not sent or delegated anyone for such a disgraceful mission. Be warned.",

          "text": "By Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA Former Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions, Rafiu Ibrahim, has traced the current woes of the Nigerian naira to the introduction of Bureau de Change by former military president General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nSenator Ibrahim, who represented Kwara South in the 8th National Assembly, added that the BDCs were introduced to legalise the then unregistered black market.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe rate at which the naira depreciated in those few years probably explains why Nigerians have never gotten over the idea of a strong currency as the mark of a \u2018strong\u2019 economy. People only remember that things got worse as the naira lost ground to the dollar.\n\n\u201cThe woes of the naira culminated in a 1,789 percent devaluation in eight years of that regime.\u201d\n\nThe Senator said this in Ilorin, Kwara State capital at a lecture organised by the state council of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ).\n\nHe added that interference of politics in matters of the economy by the current President Muhammadu Buhari government had eroded the gains recorded \u201cduring the regimes of Charles Soludo and Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as governors of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\u201d\n\nSaid he: \u201cOil prices have been the major determinant of the quantity of foreign exchange earnings of the nation, and as such have affected, and will continue to affect the exchange rate for as long as we are majorly dependent on oil.\n\n\u201cManagement of our oil earnings and reserves has been such that we take no cognizance of the fact that the major determining factors of quantity and price are not within our full control and as such when the going is good, we should save for a rainy day.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we have neglected the abundant areas of agriculture to the detriment of employment, production, income, as well as foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cWe have neglected production to the extent that all our major production industries have collapsed and we have substituted local production with importation of foreign goods.\n\n\u201cWe have prioritized consumption as a nation over and above production, and our tastes are shaped by foreign products with local products facing too many challenges to compete with their foreign counterparts or even survive.\n\n\u201cWe have had the unfortunate ill luck of governance. Most of the time, we get the wrong people appointed and elected into positions that they are not in any way prepared for. We have prioritized politics over economics, mediocrity over merit, consumption over production, savings and investments.\u201d\n\nThe above represent the challenges that bedevil the unprecedented devastating devaluation of the exchange rate of the naira in the last 35 years.\u201d\n\nHe recommended that \u201cit is time to relegate politics to the background and allow economics to rule and reign when it comes to the naira exchange rate by allowing the market to determine its fair value both at the time of boom and otherwise.\n\n\u201cIt is to stop paying lip service to instituting a concrete savings culture at all levels of government; federal, state and local. Even as an individual, when you consume all your income and fail to save, you will be feeding from hand to mouth and will always be vulnerable anytime that there is drought because you have no savings to fall back on.\n\n\u201cIt is time to diversify the economy under a truly long-term strategic plan that will turn around the fortunes of the nation away from being mono-product as is presently the case.\n\n\u201cIt is time to promote local production and industrialization, particularly of products that are highly in demand\n\n\u201cIt is time to address the incessant insecurity that is eating deep into the economic life of the nation, as the devastating effects of the situation, if unattended, will make the value of the nation\u2019s currency worse than we all can imagine.\u201d",

Therefore, the situation is unavoidable in a large political family like ours. What should be the major concern of the party leadership is whether they are fair to everybody concerned. We are, however, aware that we have some greedy politicians that still believe in the old system of godfatherism where one person takes charge of the entire state while others must queue behind him. Yes, there are party leaders, but what is obvious is that they can only be in the polling units of their wards on the day of election. The party leaders must wake up to the reality that this party now belongs to the grassroots. They are the people to vote during the elections and in most cases, they are the foot soldiers. They have the powers to make or mar any situation. Sometimes, some of the big names are just Abuja-based politicians after occupying one exalted position previously. What we are seeing today as crisis in the party is a rebellion that can be likened to greedy generals having problem with the soldiers. We are also seeing cases of people in the North going to the South or vice-versa to intervene on issues that concerns another in the name of former colleagues without necessarily understanding the terrain well there.\n\nWho is the real leader of the APC in your state Bayelsa between the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva and David Lyon, a member of APC Caretaker Committee?\n\nThe leader of the party in Bayelsa is not in any contention because everybody clearly knows that Sylva is the leader. It is not about staying in Abuja and making frivolous claims without knowing or understanding the running of the party especially financially in the state. I challenge anybody claiming that Lyon is the leader of the party Bayelsa to ask him if he has contributed a dime to the running of the party. We gave him the ticket of the party to contest the governorship election, ask him if he had come back to appreciate the people that were instrumental to it. People made enemies because of him, but he never cared to thank those that made him the standard bearer of the party during that governorship election. It is even good that he did not make it. Yes, it was by God\u2019s grace that he was elected, but he never cared to return to the people to thank them for supporting him. He never contributed a dime to the running of the party in the state. He is rather receiving sitting allowances among other things from the national. Did he care to know how we raised money to conduct the registration and congresses in the state? How can such person contest the position of who the leader of the party should be? He is just benefitting from the party while others are making contributions to sustain the party. I can tell you on good authority that he is not even contesting whether Sylva is the leader of the party in the state. What happened to him was a blessing in disguise because he would have ended up a big disappointment.\n\nSo, will it still be possible for APC to spring the kind of surprise it recorded during the last governorship election in the forthcoming one?\n\nBayelsa APC doesn\u2019t like joining issues or talking too much. We believe in action and surprising people. Even when they labelled APC an Hausa party in Bayelsa, we took the governorship ticket, a senatorial and two House of Representatives seats. Thunder will still strike twice in Bayelsa in the next governorship election.\n\nHow do you feel hearing the speculation that APC is lobbying former President Goodluck Jonathan for 2023 presidential ticket?\n\nI don\u2019t know who is flying that kite in the first place. If Jonathan must be a member of the APC, he must start registration from his ward and until such registration is done, I will not take the speculation serious. I don\u2019t know the motive of those fronting him, but I can see that he may just be testing waters with his cronies joining the APC now. Maybe he wants to use them to test how the reception will be if he decides to join the party. Yes, the Caretaker Committee chairman is doing his best in providing quality leadership to the party. He promised to bring people to the party, including serving governors, lawmakers among others and he has done that very well, but he must understand that though there is no problem Goodluck joining the party, the motive must be defined. I will deploy everything when the situation comes to offering him automatic 2023 presidential ticket. It won\u2019t come to me as a surprise if he joins and I will not stop him from joining the APC, but I will personally campaign against him if the party offers him an automatic ticket. By the way, having attained the highest office in the land, what is he looking for again joining the APC? Maybe he wants to pursue President Buhari\u2019s record because he never constructed a road to his village while Buhari has done that. In fact, he cannot get APC ticket by God\u2019s grace and I am very sure that God will not even allow him get it. God in heaven will be against him too if he is coming just to do only a tenure and short-change the South-south because of greed and selfish interest. He cannot still do anything in that single term when he could not do in the six years as president. There will be no problem if Goodluck joins the APC as an elder statesman to give advice, but if it is to get automatic ticket, I will not support him.\n\nAre you worried like most APC members the kind of persons coming into the party?\n\nMy worry is that if we continue the way we are going now, Nigeria is going to become a one-party country and it is not good for us and the democracy. Yes, no other party can defeat the APC yet there is the need for viable opposition to checkmate what the ruling party is doing. I was surprised that all the people that abused the hell of APC previously are also joining the ruling party. Let me tell you that APC is surviving even with all the lunatics coming into the party because it is laid on solid foundation. The merging parties and the ideologies made the party strong and despite the crises rocking the party, it has continued to stand solidly. The difference between the APC and PDP is that the latter is like a privately owned company, resulting in the high level dictatorship in the party while APC is made up of different owners joining hands together.\n\nHave you heard that FFK will soon become the spokesperson of the APC?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that the position is by election not appointment. I know that anybody can aspire to be anything, but he must be elected. We will see if he will purchase the form first when the time comes and we will pray if the position is zoned to his side if it is his ambition or desire.\n\nCan you allay the fears of implosion in APC because of the zoning controversy?\n\nYou need to understand how this thing works. First, the stakeholders will meet to dialogue which zone gets what position. But I want to believe that there will not be any serious problem about zoning arrangements because as you can see, all the party members aspiring for the national chairmanship position are all from the North. I don\u2019t understand why people are worried about implosion in the APC because of zoning. Having completed membership registration, ward and Local Government congresses and now looking up to the state congress despite the apprehension, why should people still entertain fears of implosion. With the all northern aspirants for the chairmanship position, there will be no serious controversy about zoning again.\n\nDid you feel bad hearing Baba Ahmed of Northern Elders Forum (NEF) claiming that power belongs to the North?\n\nWell, he is entitled to his opinion. He was exercising his fundamental human right of freedom of speech. How much such a claim will affect the country is what may give Nigerians concerns.\n\nWhat is giving you the confidence that APC will retain power beyond 2023 and what are your fears?\n\nI am not afraid and there is nothing to fear because as I usually say, APC is built on solid foundation and not even the calibre of those coming into the party will affect or stop the party from winning. APC is going to win, however, we will need divine support. All I can say is that there is so much APC government needs to fix before the 2023 general elections. We cannot claim that there are no issues of serious concern engulfing the country when we can visibly see and feel them. There will be problems with winning the election, but we must fix the country, security and economic wise, first to have a country we can proudly call our own beyond the 2023 general elections.\n\nAre you insinuating that the APC has failed Nigerians?\n\nNo. It is not true that APC has failed Nigeria. What I said is that Nigerians voted our party to fix the problems confronting them and the elected leaders must leave the country better before leaving office in 2023. We are not afraid of the PDP because they are no longer a serious threat, but we must fulfil our campaign promises and fix the country. The good news is that we will see a new country by the end of this administration.\n\nWhat is the practical solution to the insecurity ravaging the country?\n\nWe can\u2019t deny that the country is facing security challenges, but I feel that the situation is blown out of proportion most times. The propaganda is more than the reality especially as we are getting close to election year. I strongly believe that the situation is politicised. We are in the era of politicians doing everything to remain in power having enjoyed the pecks of offices. Some of them that cannot go home freely have even made Abuja their homes and that is why traffic is building up too much in Abuja now. Essentially, we are all busy blaming Mr President without asking the governors what they do with their security votes. The insecurity is happening in states where the governors collect millions and billions of Naira as security votes yet they cannot do anything. Some of the governors are even living in Abuja and once the allocation comes at the end of the month, they will use their templates to share it. The bad situation is across party lines. If the state governors cannot secure the people after collecting a security vote they should not put pressure on the Federal Government. If the governors are not in charge of security in their states as they usually claim, how come they are bankrolling the state\u2019s security apparatus like Amotukun and Ebubeagu?\n\nWhat are the chances of APC in the governorship election in Anambra State?\n\nThe chances are very bright for the APC. What is just required is for the party to do the right thing. Anambra people have also tested APGA and seen that APGA has failed them even as an Igbo party. The party could not provide the infrastructure APC has provided for the state. Look at the Second Niger Bridge that was perpetually on paper during the Goodluck Jonathan-led PDP. The major roads in Anambra are receiving Federal Government attention. The APC government has also provided inland ports to enhance their commercial activities. The only thing I want to beg Anambra people is to connect to the centre. Erosion is devastating the state and they apparently need federal attention. It is not true that the APC got it wrong during the primaries as speculated. Yes, Moghalu is in court, but as a party man and even former member of the NWC, he knows how this game is played and how the game works. Yes, the party cannot satisfy everybody, but I am surprised that he is in court.\n\nAs opposition in Bayelsa State, will you say that PDP has failed Bayelsans so far?\n\nThe PDP has failed Bayelsans big time from day one. The state has only eight local government areas, but I don\u2019t know why the state cannot be developed because it has remained a glorified village. What do they do with the allocations that come every month because nothing has changed? There are roads they have been building in the past 16 years. There is nothing on ground to show for the huge allocations the state has received in the past years. Look at what Governor Nyesom Wike is doing in Rivers and don\u2019t forget that Bayelsa was once under Rivers. There are infrastructure in Rivers that Wike cannot take along with him when he lives office. We have to start to hold the governors accountable, especially in sharing monthly allocations.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "I want to redefine African film with African stories \u2013Sandra Bremaud, filmmaker",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nAside being a filmmaker, Sandra Bremaud is also a lover of nature.\n\nAs a teenager, watching actors interpret their roles had fueled her obsession for movies. Indeed, for Sandra, filmmaking is a childhood dream come true.\n\nIn this interview, the graduate of Project Management Technology from Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) recalls her journey into Nollywood, challenges, new project and lots more. Excerpts:\n\nCan you briefly tell us about your growing up?\n\nMy growing up was fun laced with discipline. I grew up in a competitive environment that guided my vision today.\n\nWere you a spoilt child or born with a silver spoon?\n\nNo. I wasnt born with a silver spoon and was not spoilt as a child.\n\nTell us about your journey into filmmaking?\n\nMy journey into filmmaking has been pretty much of self-taught. I believe strongly that if you want to learn how to make films, just go out there and make some films. It all started from my teenage years as a university undergraduate who was obsessed with movies and watching actors interpret every character. So, this is my childhood or teenage dreams come true.\n\nWhat inspired your new movie, April Showers?\n\nApril Showers was inspired by women who are striving and conquering in their fields of work through hard work and intelligence. I felt we are not cheering and celebrating them enough, instead they are being tagged, defined etc. For example, people say \u2018don\u2019t buy that house, men will run away from you oh\u2019. But then, you are over ripe for marriage (laughs).\n\nWhat lessons are viewers expected to take home from the movie?\n\nThe viewers will definitely have something to take home. There are so many angles one can see it from, and that is what makes April Showers a unique movie for every African. It\u2019s a story that was told by an African for Africans.\n\nIs this your first cinema movie?\n\nNo, this is not my first; Love Bane was my first project. It was released in the cinema in December 2020. April Showers is my second project and it\u2019s something I am sure will gain more grounds and give me a step up in the African cinemas.\n\nHow was the experience like on set?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s learning and evolving process; and I am confident that the challenges are making me better and more creative. Hopefully, we are expecting the film in the cinemas by the end of September, as we are currently putting finishing touches to it, to make sure its worth every penny spent.\n\nCan you mention some of the stars in April Showers?\n\nWe have top actors like Enyinna Nwigwe, Lilian Esoro, Pere Egbi, Gbenga Titiloye, Gregory Ojefua, Thelma Ibemere, Anthony Monjaro, Kunle Remi, Priscilla Okpara, Sacha Ekama, Amaka Enoch and many more.\n\nWhat inspired your choice of cast and crewmembers?\n\nI think each character defined which actor got which role.\n\nWhat do you look out for before picking an actor or actress for a role?\n\nCharisma; an actor has to be delightful, appealing and enchanting to the viewers. Understanding human behaviour, some actors are knowledgeable of the human mind, and they know what\u2019s required at a given moment by their audience. Then, I look out for confidence, intelligence, hard work, energy; and the actor must be highly imaginative.\n\nHow has it been as a female filmmaker in a male dominated industry?\n\nIt has been a wonderful experience. It is also very possible to succeed as a female in such environment, despite the challenges. However, such challenges are what keep me going and I\u2019m never intimidated. In a nutshell, my vision is my driving force. I want to help redefine the African film industry by telling our African story the same way an American will tell an American story.\n\nHow was your first experience behind the camera?\n\nMy first experience was amazing, thanks to my director, Richard Omos-Iboyi, and the scriptwriter, Mrs. Pacass Adebayo. Richard guided me; he was very patient with my anxiousness. The cast members were very professional too, and that encouraged me a lot.\n\nHave you ever considered settling down with a colleague in the movie industry?\n\nI don marry oh (laughs), otherwise why not? With what I have seen so far, there are some cool, levelheaded dudes in the movie industry.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "After 10 Years Study, INEC Says Nigeria Ready for Electronic Voting",
          "text": "*Insists national ICT infrastructure adequate for e-transmission of results\n\n*Seeks clear legal mandate to implement scheme\n\n*Says 93% of polling units have internet, GSM capacity to cover outstanding 7%\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nDetermined to conduct credible elections in 2023, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has insisted on electronic transmission of election results.\n\nIt also disclosed that 93 per cent of the Polling Units in the country have internet and GSM facilities to cover the remaining seven per cent.\n\nThe electoral commission further revealed that the result of a 10-year diverse pilot programmes it conducted since 2011 and the discussions it held with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) showed that the national infrastructure is adequate to support the electronic transmission of results.\n\nIn its position paper on the desirability of electronic voting and transmission of results in real-time, signed by the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the electoral body said it had developed adequate structures and processes to successfully transmit election results electronically.\n\nThe commission sought a clear legal mandate for the implementation of the electronic transmission of election results with the Electoral Act amendment.\n\nINEC argued in the position paper dated \u2018September 13, 2021,\u2019 that the \u201celectronic transmission of results will improve the quality of election result management and that our engagement with stakeholders shows that the Nigerian public supports it.\u201d\n\nIn the paper titled: \u2018INEC Position Paper No.1 2021: Electronic Transmission of Results,\u2019 the commission stated that the technology and national infrastructure to support the electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria are adequate.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if the choice was up to INEC, the commission prefers to transmit election results electronically once the necessary legal framework is provided,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cthe transmission of election results electronically is both desirable and doable\u201d.\n\nThe commission argued that the recent debates in Nigeria over the provision of Clause 52 (3) of the Electoral Bill 2021 regarding the electronic transmission of election results \u201chave been marked by entrenched partisan positions, incomplete information, unsubstantiated fears, groundless conspiracy theories, and profound misconceptions.\u201d\n\nIt further stated that it was curious that its perspectives on this very important issue of election management remain either completely absent in the debates or at best misconceived.\n\nINEC explained that in the course of the National Assembly seeking to amend or repeal and re-enact the Electoral Act 2010, a national debate has arisen over the commission\u2019s readiness and the capacity of national infrastructure for transmitting election results electronically.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that none of the sides in this controversy appears to substantially question the desirability of electronic transmission of election results. It seems that only the preparedness of INEC and the capacity of national infrastructure are questioned,\u201d it added.\n\nINEC noted that many Nigerians had called on it to make its position on the issue public.\n\nThe commission disclosed that its positions on the issue were informed by a decade of its technical field experience, piloting, and engagement with critical stakeholders, particularly the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) on electronic transmission of election results.\n\nIt argued that a decade was not a short time for it to determine whether it was ready.\n\nINEC stressed that its intervention in these debates, particularly through its position paper, should not be misconstrued as denuding the powers of any other agency or authority to perform its functions or to hold views on the issues in question that are contrary to those of the commission.\n\nINEC stated that the answer to the question of the desirability of electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria today may be summed up in three words \u2013 trust, efficiency, and safety.\n\nThe electoral body disclosed that the verdict of Nigerians was that a progressive application of technology to election management increases trust in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWhen the commission introduced the biometric register, chip-based voters\u2019 card, and Smart Card Reader (SCR), they were widely acclaimed to be behind major improvements in the quality of elections, particularly in 2011 and 2015. Since then, Nigerians have pushed for more and more reduction in a human intervention that could alter the wishes of voters in elections,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe commission said in line with the aspiration of Nigerians, it has continued to work tirelessly to introduce appropriate, targeted, and safe technology to electoral activities, adding that the most recent was the introduction of online pre-registration for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).\n\nINEC also said the health and safety of people must be paramount in all electoral activities, including elections.\n\nINEC said the conclusion it drew from the \u201cdiverse pilots conducted since 2011 is that the country is ready for electronic transmission of results. The national ICT infrastructure is also adequate for the electronic transmission of results. This is underscored by all the discussions we held with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and the regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), over the ten years of these pilots, but especially between 2018 and 2019. It is important to share the outcome of those discussions to underscore the commission\u2019s conviction about the readiness of the country for electronic transmission of election results\u201d.\n\nOn its engagement with NCC and MNOs, the position paper noted that \u201cINEC has had a longstanding partnership with both MNOs and NCC.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the years, they have partnered INEC in sending bulk SMS, providing shortcodes, assigning e-lines, as well as mapping networks for the use of Smart Card Readers, all of which have been invaluable to the work of the commission. This partnership has continued with the discussion on electronic transmission of results,\u201d INEC added.\n\nINEC noted that on January 30, 2018, its chairman, Yakubu had paid a visit to the NCC and asked for partnership on the commission\u2019s task of conducting free, fair, and credible elections, particularly as it concerns telephony and data transmission support for the electoral process, ahead of the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the two commissions established the INEC/NCC Joint Technical Committee on Electronic Transmission of Election Results, which was co-chaired by Mr. Ubale Maska, the NCC Commissioner for Technical Services, and Dr. Mustapha Lecky, an INEC National Electoral Commissioner,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to INEC, the Joint Technical Committee included all the major MNOs.\n\nIt further disclosed that the final report of the committee signed by the Co-Chairmen and presented August 9, 2018, had noted that mobile networks adequately covered 93 per cent of INEC Polling Units with the capacity to cover the outstanding seven per cent.\n\n\u201cThe committee went on to allocate Polling Units to the four major mobile network operators \u2013 Airtel, Glo, 9Mobile and MTN \u2013 to transmit election results,\u201d adding that a total cost implication of N395,123,000 was worked out for the services covering the cost of SIM, system configuration and integration, system support and data bundle with one-year validity.\n\nIt said the Joint Committee also made other technical recommendations, including the allocation of one terabyte (1TB) of data bucket per 10,000 SIMs per annum by the network operators and configuration of one Access Point Name (APN) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) \u201cby all operators towards INEC platform to enhance security\u201d.\n\nThe committee disclosed that the detailed work and recommendations involving the major MNOs and the NCC as the regulator of telecommunications in Nigeria, profoundly convinced it that electronic transmission of election results was possible for the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cINEC expected to receive a clear legal mandate for electronic transmission of election results with the Electoral Act amendment that was ongoing at the time to commence implementation. Unfortunately, that did not happen,\u201d the position paper added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The commission sought a clear legal mandate for the implementation of the electronic transmission of election results with the Electoral Act amendment.\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that none of the sides in this controversy appears to substantially question the desirability of electronic transmission of election results.\nINEC stated that the answer to the question of the desirability of electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria today may be summed up in three words \u2013 trust, efficiency, and safety.\nINEC said the conclusion it drew from the \u201cdiverse pilots conducted since 2011 is that the country is ready for electronic transmission of results.\nThis partnership has continued with the discussion on electronic transmission of results,\u201d INEC added.",

          "title": "SANs Tackle Malami, Insist VAT Not on Exclusive List",
          "text": "Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nSenior lawyers yesterday faulted the claim by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), that the Value Added Tax (VAT) is on the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nIn an interview in New York, Malami was quoted as saying that no state has the power to lay claim to the collection of the VAT across the federation.\n\n\u201cA lot has precluded the state from collecting value-added tax. One, generally speaking, as you rightly know, the issue of the Value-Added Tax is an issue on the Exclusive Legislative List,\u201d Malami said.\n\n\u201cAnd the implication of being in Exclusive Legislative List matter is that only the National Assembly can legislate on it. The question that you may perhaps wish to address your mind on is whether there exists any national legislation that has conferred the power on the state to collect VAT. And my answer is \u2018no\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a law passed by the national assembly in that direction, no state can have a valid claim to a collection of Value-Added Tax.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility, right and constitutional power to legislate on a collection of VAT is exclusively and constitutionally vested in the national assembly and not in the state,\u201d Malami reportedly explained.\n\nBut in separate interviews with THISDAY, some senior lawyers challenged the minister to point out where VAT was mentioned in the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nHuman rights lawyers, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Dr. Mike Ozekhome (SAN), and Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), among others, faulted Malami in separate responses to THISDAY\u2019s inquiries.\n\nBut another senior lawyer, Mr. Ahmed Raji (SAN) expressed the belief that Malami was misquoted, not heard properly, or misrepresented in his claim that VAT is on the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nOn his part, Mr. John Baiyeshea (SAN) said whether it is the federal government or the state that is legally empowered to collect VAT, is a decision of the court and not the AGF or any lawyer.\n\nThe collection of VAT has been a subject of national debate since Justice Stephen D. Pam of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt ruled that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) lacked the power to collect taxes not listed under Items 58 and 59 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe FIRS had challenged the decision of the Federal High Court at the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division.\n\nThe appellate court had ordered the Rivers and Lagos State governments to maintain the status quo, pending the resolution of the legal dispute on the matter.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision of the appellate court that directed all parties to maintain the status quo, the Rivers State Government approached the Supreme Court, asking it to set aside the decision of the appellate court.\n\nCiting different judicial precedents and constitutional provisions to disprove Malami\u2019s position, Falana said the constitutional powers and competence of the federal government \u201cis limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains which does not include VAT.\u201d\n\nFalana argued that in both E.C. Ukala versus FIRS and Attorney-General of Rivers State versus FIRS, the Federal High Court held that there \u201cis no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology Levy in Rivers State or any other state of the federation.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the human rights activist contended that the federal government \u201ccannot collect VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, argued that the two decisions \u201ccannot be faulted on legal grounds. Until the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court sets them aside, to that extent, the decisions of the Federal High Court remain the law and as they cannot be impugned by any ex-cathedral statement or political opinion of any public officer, no matter how highly placed.\u201d\n\nFalana said since it would be problematic to set aside the judgments of the Federal High Court, the federal government might wish to embark on a consultation to let all the stakeholders appreciate the need to have a central collection system through the FIRS.\n\nFalana, a former President of the West African Bar Association (WABA), however, observed that the federal government should be prepared to review the unjust distribution formula if it wanted the FIRS to collect the VAT.\n\nFalana said in 2020: \u201cThe total VAT collected was N1.53 trillion. Apart from the allocation of 15 per cent to the federal government, the FIRS deducted four per cent as a collection fee while the Nigeria Customs Service deducted seven per cent from import VAT. There are some criteria involved in the distribution of FIRS that ought to be reviewed.\u201d\n\nFalana argued that having acknowledged the lacuna in the Constitution, the FIRS had mobilised the National Assembly to amend the law, noting that the attempt to use the federal legislature \u201cwill not work, as it is a non-starter.\n\n\u201cIn Attorney-General of Ogun State versus Aberuagba, the Supreme Court stated categorically that the Sales Tax Law of Ogun State was invalid as it encroached on the exclusive legislative powers of the federal government. That was the prevailing situation in the Second Republic. But the judgment is not applicable under the current political dispensation.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the VAT cannot be located in either the Exclusive or Concurrent Legislative List. Hence, it is a residual matter within the legislative competence of the House of Assembly of each State of the Federation,\u201d Falana noted.\n\nHe, however, explained that the federal government might wish \u201cto propose an amendment to the Constitution by putting VAT in the Exclusive Legislative List since another constitutional review is in progress.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to point out that VAT was increased by the National Assembly last year, albeit illegally. But the increase has not had any positive impact on the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe essence of paying VAT and other taxes has long been defeated as governments have abandoned the provision of social amenities for the people,\u201d he said.\n\nFaulting Malami\u2019s position yesterday, Ozekhome observed that the VAT \u201cis not anywhere reflected in the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe senior advocate noted the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt Division held that the VAT was not a matter within the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nHe, therefore, added that the VAT \u201cis a matter, which the state governments can or should legislate upon. As a result, there is now a law in Rivers State, which makes VAT an exclusive matter within the jurisdiction of the state. That is the present position.\n\n\u201cSo, the mere pronouncement of the attorney-general in the faraway US cannot change the law, neither can it change an extant subsisting judgment of a competent court of law, which has not been set aside by the Court of Appeal. And that remains the law.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Adegboruwa reinforced Ozekhome\u2019s viewpoint, challenging the AGF to explain why the FIRS wrote a letter to the National Assembly to list the VAT on the Exclusive Legislative List if it was already there.\n\nHe, therefore, contended that the VAT \u201cis not on the Exclusive Legislative List at all. If indeed it were on it, why would FIRS write a letter to the National Assembly, seeking to put VAT on the Exclusive Legislative List?\u201d\n\nThe senior advocate added that all states across the federation \u201care thus entitled to make laws on VAT, through their various Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is the best way to end the controversy on the VAT. The federal government has no power in law to dabble into any matter that is not within its competence,\u201d the senior advocate explained in his three-paragraph.\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Mr. Ahmed Raji (SAN) observed that a court of competent jurisdiction \u201chas made a pronouncement which has been appealed. The matter is subjudice. The golden rule in ethics is that the appeal court should be allowed to rule before any further comments for or against\u201d.\n\nRaji expressed the belief that the AGF was misquoted, not heard properly, or misrepresented.\n\nHe, however, advised that all parties should focus their attention on the contents of their brief of arguments to be filed before the appeal court or Supreme Court as the case may be.\n\nSimilarly, Baiyeshea (SAN) said whether it is the federal government or the state that is legally empowered to collect VAT, is a decision of the court and not the AGF or any lawyer.\n\nThe senior advocate noted that he would not want to make the same mistake by the AGF by commenting on a case that is already before the court,\n\nBaiyeshea said: \u201cI will not like to make the same mistake with Malami by commenting on a matter that is before the Court of Appeal presently.\n\n\u201cAll lawyers and indeed senior lawyers should know that we are not permitted to comment on or express an opinion on subjudice matters.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, whatever the AGF has said will not matter. What matters is the decision of the superior court (in this instance, the Court of Appeal), which we are all waiting for. The matter will not stop at the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cIt will certainly get to the Supreme Court. Whatever pronouncement the Supreme Court makes (based on interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution), will eventually be the law. Therefore, what the AGF or any other lawyer or persons have said or may say, will at best be speculative opinions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022UBA publishes names, account details of forex defaulters\n\nNume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nAThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has disclosed that the apex bank\u2019s interventions to protect the economy from the impacts of COVID-19 represented 3.5 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP was estimated at $432.29 billion by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThis is coming as the United Bank for Africa (UBA) has published the names and account numbers of some customers who allegedly defied the forex policy of the apex bank.\n\nEmefiele stated this yesterday in Lagos in his keynote address on the occasion of the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) 2021 Annual Conference and 30th Anniversary Celebration with the theme: \u2018Financing Infrastructure and SMEs for Inclusive Growth in the Post-COVID-19 Economy.\u2019\n\nThe CBN governor who was represented by the Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, said the conference provided an opportunity to share the CBN\u2019s experiences at boosting the economy by stimulating investments towards the development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on key economic variables, the CBN took several measures to mitigate the long-term effects on the growth prospects of the economy. First, policy measures were introduced to restore stability in the economy by supporting households that have been severely affected by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAlso, targeted interventions were introduced to support critical sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing, energy, and health. Cumulatively, the bank\u2019s intervention efforts represented about 3.5 per cent of the GDP.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said that the CBN has equally developed and introduced low-interest and long-term finance interventions in tandem with the gestation periods of infrastructure projects in line with the bank\u2019s developmental mandate to stimulate finance for infrastructure development in Nigeria.\n\nThe design of the interventions, according to him, was hinged on the need to develop enabling infrastructure in critical sectors to drive economic growth and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo fast-track, the development of infrastructure in the power and aviation sectors, the Power and Airlines Intervention Facility (PAIF) disbursed N312.77 billion to 73 projects to stimulate investment in the sectors, improve power generation, support retention of sustainable jobs and enhance the living standard of the citizens through improved access to electricity.\u201d\n\nEmefiele acknowledged that the current level of infrastructure deficit in Nigeria \u201cis a major constraint to economic development and attainment of growth average rate of at least five to seven per cent required to boost productivity and sustainable growth for businesses.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the World Development Indicators (2019), which said that 56.20 per cent of Nigerians have access to electricity, while electric power consumption stood at 144.52 kWh per capita as of 2018.\n\nHe added that \u201cwhile infrastructure deficit in Nigeria is estimated to be about 1.2 per cent of GDP, it is projected that the federal government needs to commit about $10billion annually to address the nation\u2019s infrastructural deficit.\u201d\n\nThe central bank governor stated that lack of access to quality infrastructure has been a limiting factor to MSMEs potential for growth and creating employment.\n\nEmefiele said access to finance remained one of the biggest threats to MSME development with serious implications for productivity, economic development, and job creation.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit has been identified as a critical enabler for the growth and development of MSMEs, as the overall credit gap for MSMEs in developing countries is estimated to be $5.2 trillion, representing 19 per cent of these countries\u2019 cumulative GDP. Of this, the unmet financing demand from MSMEs in sub-Saharan Africa is about $331 billion, representing 18 per cent of the potential demand for credit by MSMEs in the region.\n\n\u201cWith over 42 million MSMEs in Nigeria, contributing 49.78 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP, 7.64 per cent of exports, and employing 76.5 per cent of the workforce, the sector is faced with numerous challenges that continue to limit the enterprises\u2019 potential to contribute to economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nEmefiele referred to a PwC report, which said that access to electricity accounted for the major share of costs to daily operations of MSMEs, adding that the energy sector is overwhelmed by a plethora of challenges that ranged from operational inefficiencies to infrastructure deficiencies, which have resulted in inadequate electricity supply to households and businesses in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis has contributed significant economic costs to MSMEs, thus hampering their competitiveness and contribution to economic growth. Specifically, the IMF has identified a lack of access to reliable electricity which costs the Nigerian economy an estimated $29 billion annually.\n\n\u201cThe financing gap for MSMEs in Nigeria is estimated to be about N617.3 billion annually pre-Covid-19 pandemic, as less than five per cent of these businesses have access to adequate finance to support their working capital and business expansion needs (PwC).\n\n\u201cOther constraints to MSME development in Nigeria, as noted in the survey, included difficulty in finding customers, infrastructure deficit, insufficient cashflows, multiple taxations, regulatory burden, and sub-optimal implementation of the provisions of the MSME policy,\u201d he said.\n\nUBA Publishes Names, Account Details of Forex Defaulters\n\nIn another development, the UBA has published the names and account numbers of some customers who allegedly defied the forex policy of the CBN.\n\nThe individuals were said to have applied for Personal Travel Allowance (PTA) and bought cheap dollars at the bank but did not use it for the purpose.\n\nThe account numbers and Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) of the defaulters were included in the publication on the bank\u2019s website.\n\nAccording to the bank, the beneficiaries committed the offence after applying for fake tickets or visas.\n\nThe UBA disclosed this in a publication on its website titled \u2018CBN FX defaulters,\u2019 at the weekend.\n\nIt stated that it took the step \u201cIn compliance with the directive of Central Bank of Nigeria mandating banks to publish the names of defaulters of the forex exchange regulation.\n\n\u201cBased on regulatory directives, the following customers cancelled their trips and failed to return the PTA availed to them despite several emails, text messages and follow up phone calls.\u201d\n\nThe bank added that the customers presented fake visas to apply for PTA.\n\nBanks had earlier sent messages to their customers to notify them that travellers who bought foreign exchange from banks for travel purposes but failed to embark on the trip two weeks after their scheduled travel date must return the forex to the banks.\n\nAccording to the banks, this was a directive from the CBN.\n\nThe banks had also disclosed that defaulting customers who presented fraudulent travel credentials or cancelled their tickets and failed to refund the purchased PTA and BTA within two weeks, as stated in the signed customer declaration form, would have their identities and bank verification numbers published.\n\nThe CBN had in a circular to all banks dated August 30 and signed by the CBN Director, Banking Supervision Department, Mr. Haruna Mustafa, stated that the trend if not curbed, presented a risk to the integrity and stability of the forex market.\n\n\u201cCBN, therefore, directed banks to publish on their websites within two weeks the names and BVN of defaulting customers who presented fake travel documents or cancelled their tickets and failed to return the purchased PTA/BTA, as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed by them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the end of bankers\u2019 committee press brief, the Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, had noted that: \u201cBanks have been criticised for not being able to handle PTA and BTA transactions and just to let people know that we would continue to exercise the due diligence required concerning KYC and compliance.\n\n\u201cFX is a scarce resource, so if we find people coming up with tickets that have expired or tickets that are going to be cancelled, or illegitimate passports or people buying more than they are supposed to buy, they will be reported to law enforcement agencies. People should comply with the rules as stipulated by the CBN.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "UK Approves COVID-19 Vaccines Administered in Nigeria",
          "text": "Chinedu Eze in Lagos and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, yesterday debunked statements suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccines administered in Nigeria were not approved by the UK.\n\nShe added that the claim was \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d and should be disregarded.\n\nThe UK has also moved Nigeria to the \u201crest of the world\u201d travel list about the travel rule billed to take effect from October 4, 2021.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Laing said the UK approves of vaccines currently in use in Nigeria irrespective of the manufacturer.\n\nShe said that Nigeria is on the \u201crest of the world\u201d list, with simplified travel measures.\n\nShe said the UK has so far donated 1.2 million vaccines to Nigeria through COVAX and will continue to support the country in accessing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe encouraged all eligible Nigerians to get vaccinated to help stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThe UK is committed to global access to vaccines and is among the largest funders to COVAX. The UK has donated 1.2 million vaccines specifically to Nigeria through COVAX and will continue to provide support,\u201d Laing said.\n\n\u201cThe UK strongly supports the work of the Nigerian health authorities and Nigeria\u2019s vaccination campaign, and strongly encourages all eligible residents in Nigeria to get vaccinated. Only once we are all vaccinated can we end the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI would like to emphasise that any statements that COVID-19 vaccines administered in Nigeria are not approved by the UK are completely untrue. The UK recognises the Oxford-Astra Zeneca, Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines used in Nigeria, irrespective of where they are manufactured.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about rules concerning international travel to the UK, the high commissioner said the UK is using the COVID-19 vaccination certification process to ensure people enter the country safely.\n\nShe said from October 4 the current travel system would be simplified and Nigeria which is currently on the amber list will be added to the \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list with simplified travel measures.\n\n\u201cThe UK is committed to opening up international travel and we are using our COVID-19 vaccination certification process to enable those wishing to enter the UK to do so safely. We know these matters hugely to many people in the UK and Nigeria \u2013 the extensive people-people ties between our two countries are at the heart of our bilateral relationship,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFrom 4 October, the current system will be simplified. There will be a single red list of countries and territories where stricter rules apply, and there will also be a \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list, with simplified travel measures. The \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list will include countries currently on the UK\u2019s amber list, such as Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that the UK Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, had on September 17, 2021, announced a simplified system for international travel in light of the success of the country\u2019s domestic vaccine rollout that provides greater stability for industry and passengers.\n\nThe UK proposed to replace the current traffic light system with a single red list of countries and territories to protect public health.\n\nTesting requirements would also be reduced for eligible fully vaccinated travellers, who will no longer need to take a Pre-Departure Test when travelling to the UK from 4 a.m. of October 4.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I started working with him in 2017 through 2019. I experienced many things at FFK's house, the way he handles his staff. Let me use myself as an example. Mine started the day the man paid salary in 2019 August, he paid me my salary and later sent someone to call me down to the kitchen.\n\n\u201cI came to the kitchen and then he asked me why the kitchen is in disarray, I told him he had not employed me as a kitchen worker or chef but as a nanny. I told him I had no job in the kitchen. He then asked me to return the money I signed as my salary, I gave it to him.\n\n\u201cHe seized it and I said this is not the first, second or third time, why does he do this every time? He said if I talk, he will throw me to the dog, they'll beat me up and everything so I got angry, went back upstairs to pack my bags that I don't want to work again but I want to leave.\n\n\u201cHe called bodyguards: Bako, Moses and others, that they shouldn't allow me to go outside the gate. When those ones said I shouldn't go outside the gate, I explained to them that I work and at the end of the month, after having signed salary, he will collect it back.\n\n\u201cWhile I was discussing with the bodyguards, he told those ones to hold me down and not allow me to leave, he (FFK) came downstairs, tore my clothes, stripped me naked and pushed me outside the gate, I was there for 24 hours naked.\n\n\u201cHe later sent a policeman to come and pick me. There's one guy, a gateman that gave me a 'polo' (T-shirt), I don't know if he's still working there.\n\n\u201cThe DPO (Divisional Police Officer) said they don't want to see FFK's staff anymore so the policeman took me back there to FFK's house, I was there for another 24 hours, asking them to give me my bag, he refused.\n\n\u201cEvery morning, Madam (his ex-wife) commanded that we should be taking his son to FFK's room every morning to greet his father. When you get there, Fani-Kayode will press your buttocks, breasts and I told him I don't want that. Even the small boy will say \u2018Daddy don't do that to my Aunty\u2019 then he will push me away and say I am disgusting and everything. That if I tell Madam anything, he will connive with her to do me evil.\n\n\u201dWhat surprised me was, one day, FFK beat madam and stripped her naked, Madam's mother was like, in-law what is it? He beat the woman too.\u201d\n\nSeveral allegations including sexual harassment and assault have been levelled against Fani-Kayode over time by some of his former domestic workers.\n\nThey described the former Minister as an erratic and cantankerous man who uses his bodyguards to assault and give them corporeal punishments.",

As winners, each of the startups gets \u20a6500,000 worth of TechCabal coverage.\n\n\u201cFor my team and I, winning at the pitching session validates our vision for the future of e-commerce in Africa, that is, conversational and social commerce,\u201d Ronald Tagoe, Founder of ChatBots Africa, told TechCabal. \u201cWe are very elated by this validation and look forward to an exciting future.\u201d\n\nBased in Kenya, ChatBots is a multi-channel bot platform that allows companies to use AI chatbots on WhatsApp. According to the company, the solution is built for all ranges of experiences; from the complete newbie to the advanced user.\n\nAccording to Tagoe, the startup won because the solution and business model were \u201cvery clear and the customers\u2019 pain point was something the judges gravitated towards.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor Wunmi Akinsola, CEO and founder of Fashtracker, winning the investment pitch session represents \u201ca major validation\u201d for the startup.\n\nNigeria-based Fashtracker connects trusted and sustainable African fashion brands to people within and outside the continent through its online platform. \u201cWe aim to be the go-to fashion destination within Africa, and globally, for African brands,\u201d a statement on the company\u2019s website reads.\n\n\u201cI feel super motivated to keep building Fashtracker,\u201d the elated founder said. \u201cThe fact that Techcabal, the investors, and other stakeholders involved bought into the idea from a 2-minute pitch is a major validation that is a necessary component for the success of any startup.\u201d\n\nAkinsola believes certain factors propelled the judges to select the startup as the winner; such as the fact that the African fashion marketplace is \u201crelatively untapped and is a huge opportunity\u201d considering the barriers to entry such as logistics, payments, and scale, are already being solved.\n\n\u201cThere are too many opportunities for scalable integrations including menswear, skincare, B2B, Saas, VAS, and this could all be on a Pan African/Global-scale if done right,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn addition, Akinsola notes that startups like Fashtracker have the capacity to alleviate thousands of creatives, and fashion entrepreneurs economically. \u201cEspecially during such tough times in Nigeria \u2013 economic prosperity is key.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of ChatBots Africa website. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nTagged the #FutureOfCommerce2021, the high-production event enabled registered stakeholders to learn the shifts in the industry and buying behaviour, and how they can better prepare to take advantage of the rising tide, whether as organizations or individuals.\n\nThe hybrid conference brought together startups, investors, banks, telecoms companies, FMCGs, policymakers, small businesses, tech enthusiasts, and everyday consumers to discuss their thoughts and predictions around all the changes coming to how people buy and sell on the continent.\n\n\u201cThe organisation (TechCabal) is top-notch and the ideas and insights shared were thought-provoking,\u201d Tagoe said when asked about the Future of Commerce. \u201cThumbs up to the team.

          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "How edtech startup, Stranerd is connecting Nigerian students to tutors",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Boss Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in the United States, Godwin talked with a girl. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work. But if there\u2019s any challenge, it would be understanding the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the Nigerian market is not easy, and Nigerians relate differently with edtech startups. I think that\u2019s where most edtech people have it wrong, trying to replicate what people in America are using.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And according to the United Nations, September 23 every year is an opportunity to support and protect the linguistic identity and cultural diversity of all deaf people and other sign language users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) estimates that there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide and more than 80% of them are from developing countries.\n\nHow do people with hearing impairments communicate? Depending on the degree of severity, they use hearing aids, speech-to-text tools and sign languages to communicate.\n\nBefore yesterday, I thought there was just one universal sign language that every deaf person understood.\n\nHowever, studies show that there are over 300 sign languages in the world, and over 23 of them are used in Africa.\n\nInterestingly, technology is assisting people in Africa who have varying degrees of hearing loss.\n\nTo know how, please, read: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nOr watch the video: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nReelFruit raises $3 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s dried fruit snack brand, ReelFruit, has announced a $3 million Series A round to expand production, increase product offerings, and double down on exports to the US and other international markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlitheia IDF led the round with $2m. Samata Capital and Flying Doctor Healthcare Investment Company also participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Affiong Williams (CEO), ReelFruit is an agritech company that processes and distributes locally grown fruits. It claims to help communities by empowering fruit farmers by purchasing their raw materials.\n\nMore on its expansion plans, ReelFruit plans to build a new factory in Ogun State, Nigeria, to increase its monthly dried fruit production from 6 to 30 tonnes.\n\nIn its first year, the factory will employ over 200 people. With a larger supply of dried fruit, ReelFruit will develop new products for domestic and international markets.\n\nBy December 2021, the company plans to launch an eCommerce channel for direct US sales and open up more B2B opportunities, such as white-labelling and co-packing, to support the national drive toward import substitution.\n\nThe company believes local buyers will purchase dried fruit locally, reducing their reliance on imports.\n\nPaystack launches Apple Pay to help Nigerian businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack, an African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, announced yesterday that Pay with Apple Pay is now available on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean? Nigerian businesses will have access to millions of Apple Pay users across more than 60 countries where the payments service is available. And according to Paystack, it is the \u201cfastest, secure way for Nigerian businesses to accept international payments.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2014, Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s mobile payments and digital wallet service, allows users to pay securely and privately on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macbooks.\n\nHow will it work? When a customer with Apple Pay buys from a Paystack merchant, they will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay. They can then proceed to pay using Touch ID or Face ID.\n\nThey can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted commerce tools \u2014 Paystack Storefronts or Invoices \u2014 and through a variety of payment channels such as cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes, and EFT.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. Flutterwave, an African payments company, integrated PayPal into its platform in March 2021, allowing PayPal customers worldwide to pay African merchants via its \u201cPay with PayPal\u201d feature.\n\nNow is an excellent moment to read this: Nigerians, other African merchants can now accept PayPal via Flutterwave partnership\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhy Africa must be independent on healthcare support \u2013 AfDB President.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges deaf people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play.

          "title": "Projects worth N12trn abandoned across Nigeria",
          "text": "Rising security challenges in Nigeria, which have impacted all businesses, are taking a deadlier toll on the hospitality sector, especially in the northern part the country, with dwindling investment in the sector due to perceived unsafe business environment.\n\nThis correlates with recent findings by construction industry professionals that reveal that an estimated 56,000 construction projects valued at N12 trillion have been abandoned across Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones for various reasons.\n\nThese projects belong to private and public sector organizations, meaning that savings, bank credits and tax-payers money have been buried, leading to loss of jobs and income that affect so many people.\n\nBesides security concerns, most of the projects, according to Abba Tor, president, Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS), were abandoned due to poor research on the monetary estimates required for them. Hospitality sector, as a segment of the real estate market, is a major victim.\n\nDespite the boom in the hospitality sector, in the last two decades, no foreign branded hotel is located in Northern Nigeria except Abuja, which investors, who shun the other states in the region, perceive to be safe.\n\nAt present, the region\u2019s hospitality industry, according to hospitality experts, is losing over N10 billion annually to lack of quality investments in the sector, occasioned by the growing insecurity in the country, especially in the region.\n\nRead Also: PurpleLekki: New face of entertainment, hospitality industry on the way\n\nThat also is the reason for the near-zero investment in other real estate assets, especially residential and commercial properties. The region has seen significant destruction of homes by insurgents, more so in the crisis-ridden states like Borno and Kaduna.\n\nA report by the World Bank states that since commencement of the Boko Haram Scourge in 2009, about 956,453 (nearly 30%) out of 3,232,308 private houses; 5,335 classrooms and school buildings in 512 primary, 38 secondary and two tertiary institutions; 1,205 municipal, local government or ministry buildings; 76 police stations have been affected in Borno State.\n\nThough all these have, by default, created investment opportunities, investors are not investing, except some desperate ones who go about acquiring destroyed properties, or properties that are located in a crises area at cheaper prices for speculative purposes, according to Jambil Suyudi, an estate surveyor and valuer. \u201cBesides loss of homes, jobs that would have been created have also been lost,\u201d Suyudi said.\n\nBitrus Yakubu, a former commissioner in Plateau State and hotel investor, decries that Kano, the commercial and largest city in the region, including Kaduna and Jos, the once thriving tourism hubs in the region, all have capacity to attract over 10 branded hotels each, but have lost such opportunities to the growing insecurity in the region scaring away investors with huge capacity.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Sheraton brand in Kano, it will attract more of its kind. If you have 10 of such in a city, the taxes to the government is huge, employment and empowerment opportunities, especially for supplies will be huge. A foreign branded hotel in Abuja makes over N10 million a day, and if you multiply that for over 30 of such hotels across the other parts of the northern region where they are lacking, the region will be richer with over N10 billion annually\u201d, Yakubu said.\n\nExplaining the dynamics of the hospitality industry, Kunle Alatishe, a Dubai-based Accor Hotel Group sales executive, noted that huge investments attract bigger brands and the bigger the brand behind a hotel, the more the capacity and pricier the offerings are, hence guests are willing to pay $300 per night in a foreign branded boutique hotel in Abuja than N50,000 in the best hotel in Kano.\n\nThe former staff of Transcorp Hilton Abuja explained that foreign branded hotels come with quality offerings, service excellence and huge capacity that lure world-class travellers, foreigners, event planners and multinationals, which have capacity to pay for the hotel\u2019s appreciable pricing.\n\nHe regrets that lack of such investments has denied the region revenue from the hospitality value chain from taxes, supplies and deliveries, receipts from tours, purchase of local craft, and employment of locals, among other benefits.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, Accor Hotel Group was interested in expanding to Kaduna and Kano, considering the improvement on the airport, rail and other infrastructure, but the kidnapping, especially in Kaduna, made the key investor to pull out. His financial advisers warned him that it would be hard to sustain good return on his investment considering the escalating security challenge and that was how that project and many others died because of the insecurity,\u201d Alatishe said.\n\nCurrently, there are 12 foreign branded hotels in the North, with four in the pipeline and all are in Abuja, yet their least rooms are more expensive than the highest rooms in Fifth Chukka Resort Kaduna and Bristol Palace Hotel Kano, considered as the priciest hotels in the northern apart from Abuja.\n\nMaking a case for more investments in foreign brands, Emmanuel Ele, MD/CEO, Six Regions Hotels Limited, managers of Dominion Court Apartments & Rooms, Lagos, noted that with their huge capacity, pricey rates, and global networking, foreign brands pay better, train and often offer committed staff opportunity to join their global workforce amid many benefits.\n\nHowever, the indigenous hotels are not doing better in the region as insecurity has stifled their business in the last decade, while many who managed to stay afloat in the face of the security challenge are closing shop now because of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the worsening security situation.\n\nAccording to a report by Guest Frontline, a hospitality research outfit, indigenous hotels are growing five times more than foreign ones in Abuja, 10 times more in Lagos, seven times more in Port Harcourt and Owerri, while one third of such investments have closed in the northern region from 2009 till date due to poor patronage.\n\nAt present, only a few hotels are recording slightly above 20 percent occupancy rate in Maiduguri, 30 in Bauchi and 35 in Jos, while some have closed down due to dwindling profit that no longer sustain the business.\n\n\u201cBefore the crisis in 2009, an average room in Jos was around N10,000, it went down to N5000 at the wake of the crisis. It also improved with relative peace but always goes down at any crisis like we are experiencing now with the August 2021 killings\u201d, Shallom Buka, a hotel manager in Vom, Jos, said.\n\nSame applies to key towns in the region, from Jos, Kaduna, Maiduguri, Bauchi, Yola, Katsina to others, hotel rate crashes the moment crisis sets in as guests evacuate their rooms or leave town for safety.\n\nAs well, both local and foreign investors are now shifting to regions with relative peace and with assurance of good return on their investments.\n\nHospitality experts think that the trend of poor patronage, closing of hotels and shunning of investments in the region will continue as long as the security challenges are not addressed across the region.",

The e-Naira is built on a blockchain open ledger technology. Creating the e-Naira on the blockchain means you cannot have a duplicate or fake e-Naira. Each e-Naira note will be unique.\n\nEthiopian Airlines to begin flights to Enugu from October 1st\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest airline, Ethiopian Airlines has announced that it will resume flights to Enugu Airport from the 1st of October, two years after the east African giant suspended flights to the southeastern state of Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by Shimeles Arage, the airline\u2019s general manager, in Lagos on Sunday, stating that every week there would be a flight on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, with B787 Dreamliner, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOct. 1 is Nigeria\u2019s Independence Day and the flight to Enugu on that day will reinforce Ethiopian Airline\u2019s good relations with Nigeria since the first flight to Nigeria in 1960,\u201d Arage said.\n\nDigital transactions to be taxed technologically from the week ahead\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the use and deployment of technology to tax all digital transactions carried out across Nigeria in a bid to improve government earnings.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha at the 17th General Assembly and 10th anniversary of the West Africa Tax Administration Forum (WATAF) in Abuja on Tuesday, organised by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), reported by the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nThe SGF said the office of the Presidency ordered the FIRS to ensure digital transactions were taxed digitally, in a bid to achieve seamless digital collection and remittance of tax revenue accrued from the digital economy to improve revenue collection and remittance as a matter of government policy.\n\nChairman of FIRS, Mohammed Nami, said the importance of the role of WATAF could not be overemphasised because the reason it was set up by the founding fathers, was to create the atmosphere for dialogue on collaborative efforts, citing its theme for 2021, \u201cThe Taxation of the Digital Economy: Exploring Untapped Revenue Sources in Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cTax regulators and other industry stakeholders must rise up to the challenge of being in a position to tap into the stream of opportunity that advancements in science and technology afford us, \u201d he stated.\n\nIPOB set to protest in the week ahead of October 1st celebrations\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has declared another sit-at-home protest on October 1, which is the anniversary of Nigeria\u2019s independence, insisting that they would lock down the entire Southeast.\n\nThe separatist group also directed its members to bring down all Nigerian flags mounted anywhere throughout the South East, with effect from September 25, 2021.\n\nThis disclosure is contained in a statement issued by the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, and made available to the press in Awka, Anambra State on Saturday, September 25, 2021.\n\nThe reaction from IPOB follows information received by the group about an alleged plot by the Department of State Service (DSS) not to produce Kanu in court on October 21 as part of the ploy to continue to incarcerate him.\n\nGoogle grants users access to check advertizers campaign history\n\nGoogle will begin providing users with additional information about the companies that are sponsoring the ads they see.

Following complaints about frauds on the platform, the objective is to assist users to accurately determine if a certain ad buyer is trustworthy.\n\nAccording to the company, it has begun vetting advertisers in 90 countries, but the disclosure option will be available only in the United States in the coming months, with plans to extend to other nations in 2022.\n\nEvery day, more than 30 million people engage with Google ads\u2019 transparency and control menus, and the simplified experience of \u201cAbout this ad\u201d has garnered a good response. The company noted that users interact with their ad transparency and control features on YouTube more than on any other Google property. In the coming months, the company plans to extend the \u201cAbout this ad\u201d functionality to YouTube and \u2018Search\u2019 to help users make educated decisions online, regardless of where they engage.\n\nMojdeh Tomsich, product manager, Ads Privacy and Safety at Google said in a blog post: \u201cToday, people engage with a wider variety of ad formats on more Google products than ever before \u2014 from Video ads on YouTube to Shopping ads across Search, Display and more. And they increasingly want to know more about the ads they see. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been innovating on features like \u201cAbout this ad\u201d to help users understand why an ad was shown, and to mute ads or advertisers they aren\u2019t interested in.\n\nCrude oil prices trade at the highest levels since 2018, tending towards $80 a barrel\n\nOil prices steadied on Friday near a two-month high of $77.50 a barrel and was headed for a third straight week of gains, supported by global output disruptions and inventory draws.\n\nThe supply of crude oil in the United States dropped to its lowest level in almost three years last week, as hurricanes Ida and Nicholas caused lower inventories.\n\nOil prices dipped on Monday, extending upper week\u2019s losses after the U.S. dollar jumped to a three-week high and the U.S. rig count rose, although nearly a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico output stayed offline in the wake of two hurricanes.\n\nWith about 16 Percent of Crude Oil Production in the Gulf of Mexico Still Offline, U.S. oil refiners are hunting to replace crude lost to the Hurricanes. U.S. refiners are turning to Iraqi and Canadian oil, while their Asian buyers are pursuing the Middle Eastern and Russian grades.\n\nIn addition to declining output due to underinvestment or maintenance delays caused by COVID-19, some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies (OPEC+) have also been challenged to raise output.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to grow steadily supported by global output disruptions and inventory draws.\n\nNational Bureau of Statistics economy data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\n\u00b7 Monday 27th September 2021: Air Transportation Data (Half-year 2021)\n\nCurrency market\n\nOn a week-on-week basis, the Naira depreciated in value, at the I & E FX window, the domestic currency fell by -0.49% to N414.90/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.

          "text": "Anambra elections have always been for moneybags. Big boys showcase their war chest. It is about, if you do not have the cash, do not dare. Those who have formidable godfathers also flex their muscles.\n\nIn 1999, Chinwoke Mbadinuju, a legal practitioner, became the governor of Anambra State at the behest of Emeka Offor, an oil mogul.\n\nChris Ngige managed to preside over the state on the benevolence of the then enfant terrible and moneybags, Chris Ubah.\n\nUbah did not only have the cash, he also had all the right connections, and his tentacles stretched deep into the Presidential Villa during the Olusegun Obasanjo administration. Ngige had the brain as a medical doctor.\n\nPeter Obi did not also come to the Government House as a poor man. His net worth at that time conferred some air of confidence in him. He did not just stop the fight at the polling units; he brutally pursued and won a number of legal battles.\n\nThe incumbent Governor, Willie Obiano could be said to be Obi\u2019s \u201cman Friday\u201d and effortlessly rode to the power stool on Obi\u2019s crest. It would be uncharitable though to say Obiano contested the position as a pauper, because he had made some money having worked at the apex levels of some oil companies and banks before venturing into politics.\n\nToday, as the state prepares for an off-season gubernatorial election fixed for November 6, 2021, a galaxy of stars has appeared on the scene, jostling to succeed Obiano.\n\nWhile a few of them cannot be said to be moneybags on their own, they however, have eminent backers ready to bankroll their electoral expenses to the last kobo.\n\nA good number of them are private-sector players who have never, either worked for government or done any contract for government. They became whatever they are today by dint of hard work.\n\nFor some months now, Anambra has been in the news. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been going back and forth on the issues arising from the factional and acrimonious primaries of some parties in the race.\n\nSome lawyers have also used the opportunity of the confusion to profiteer from the process as they engage in \u201cforum shopping\u201d- taking cases to faraway places outside the jurisdiction where they originated. Some of the judges have also smiled to the bank as a result of entertaining such cases.\n\nINEC, until recently, had been thrown into confusion as to what to do with the ballot, as it continued to add and drop names of candidates in line with the variegated court pronouncements.\n\nIt does appear that the coast is now clear for the Commission to really do its job as those who are supposed to represent their parties are now cleared by the court and their parties.\n\nRead Also: Soludo, Ozigbo missing as INEC releases list of Anambra Guber candidates\n\nThe final list of candidates for the election will however, be published by INEC in October.\n\nOf the political parties, seven are prominent. They are the All Progressives Congress (APC) represented by Andy Uba; All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Chukwuma Soludo is the standard bearer.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) is being represented by Valentine Ozigbo. The Accord Party (AP) has Godwin Maduka as its candidate.\n\nOthers are Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) with Obiora Okonkwo as the candidate; Youth Progressive Party (YPP) is represented by Ifeanyi Ubah, and Labour Party (LP) fielding Obiora Agbasimalo.\n\nAlthough all the candidates have since commenced skeletal campaign, BusinessDay gathered that the real electioneering will begin from Monday, September 27, 2021.\n\nGodwin Maduka\n\nGodwin Maduka was born in 1959 in Nkerehi, Orumba South Local Government Area. He is a Nigerian-American doctor, businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Las Vegas Pain Institute and Medical Centre. In 2008, he played a major role in the renaming of his hometown, from Nkerehi to Umuchukwu.\n\nHe started his education in Nawfia Comprehensive Secondary School and All Saints Grammar School, Umunze, before getting admission to study Medicine at the University of Port Harcourt, but couldn\u2019t join his peers due to lack of monetary support. He got an opportunity through his cousin Richard Igwike (who taught at Russ College at the time) to study at Rust College on a scholarship that covered half of his tuition. He later got monetary support from his younger brother and uncle and moved to the United States in 1982. In 1984, he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry from Rust College and got another scholarship to study pharmacy at Mercer University, graduating in 1988.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked as a pharmacy technician, before getting a full scholarship to study medicine at the University of Tennessee, where he completed an internship and graduated in 1993. He furthered to Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre for his post-graduate training and residency in anesthesiology, critical care, and pain management, graduating in 1997.\n\nIn 1997, after his education, Maduka moved to Las Vegas and got a job where he was paid $8,000 as an advance payment. He worked as an anesthesiologist at Desert Spring United Methodist Church, Nevada and other hospitals, before starting his own practice at Red Rock Medical Group, Nevada. In 1999, he founded Las Vegas Pain Institute and Medical Centre, before expanding to other six locations in Southern Nevada.\n\nHe is a clinical faculty supervisor and adjunct professor of pain management and anesthesiology at Touro University Nevada. He is also a clinical assistant professor of surgery at UNLV School of Medicine. While growing up, Maduka\u2019s mother was a farmer and merchant. His father was a traditional herbalist.\n\nToday, Maduka has touched many people with his philanthropic gestures. He has built houses for indigent members of society. He believes that what he has been able to do is enough to convince voters that he is the best man for the job.\n\nKen Emeakhayi, who recently joined Maduka\u2019s team, said: \u201cMany people are coming to you asking for your votes and promising they will develop your community when they become governor, but you need to go and check what they have been able to achieve for their own communities.\n\n\u201cMaduka is from a poor family, but made a pledge to God that he will bless the poor with his resources, and he has been doing that as a private individual. That is why he has developed his community.\n\n\u201cHis dream is to see that he helps a lot more people out of poverty, and the only way to do this is to get government machinery, by becoming governor.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Anambra guber: The battle of moneybags, intrigues and antics\n\nAndy Uba\n\nAndy Uba was born on December 14, 1958 in Enugu, and attended the Boys High School in Awkunanaw. His parents originated from Uga in the Aguata LGA of Anambra State.\n\nWhile still in the United States Uba assisted in the 1999 Presidential elections in Nigeria.\n\nFollowing the elections he returned to Nigeria and was appointed Special Assistant on Special Duties and Domestic Affairs to President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nIn 2007, Uba contested in the PDP primaries for the Anambra State governorship election, and was elected in the April 14, 2007 elections. However, the former governor Peter Obi challenged the election, saying that because the courts had only accepted that Obi had won the April 2003 elections on 15 March 2006, he still had three more years or his four-year term to serve. The courts accepted this argument and on June 14, 2007 nullified Andy Uba\u2019s election. In November 2009 it was reported that Uba was planning to run for the delayed Anambra State gubernatorial elections in February 2010 on the Labour Party platform, after the Labour Party had invited him to make the move. The party\u2019s leadership said they \u201cbelieved that he will deliver on the ideals and objectives of the party\u201d. In the February 2010 elections, Uba came in third.\n\nUba returned to the PDP and was nominated as PDP candidate for Anambra South Senatorial district in the April 2011 elections. He won with 63,316 votes, ahead of Chukwumaeze Nzeribe of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) with 43,798 and the Senator Ikechukwu Obiorah of the Accord Party with 24,724. Uba\u2019s election was challenged by Senator Obiora, the Accord candidate, who claimed that Uba had forged his West African School Certificate (WASC) and had not obtained any of the university degrees that he claimed.\n\nChukwuma Soludo\n\nCharles Chukwuma Soludo was born on July 28, 1960. He is a Nigerian economics professor and a former governor and chairman of the board of directors of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Chukwuma was named governor of CBN on May 29, 2004. He is also a member of the British Department for International Development\u2019s International Advisory Group.\n\nSoludo has been a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund, the University of Cambridge, the Brookings Institution, the University of Warwick, and the University of Oxford as well as a visiting professor at Swarthmore College (USA). He has also worked as a consultant for a number of international organisations, including The World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Programme. Soludo is a core professional in the business of macroeconomics. He obtained his three degrees and then professorship at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, Enugu State. Soludo graduated with a First Class Honours degree in 1984, an MSc Economics in 1987, and a PhD in 1989, winning prizes for the best student at all three levels.\n\nChukwuma has been trained and involved in research, teaching, and auditing in such disciplines as multi-country macro-econometric modelling, techniques of computable general equilibrium modelling, survey methodology, and panel data econometrics, among others. He studied and taught these courses at many universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and Warwick. Soludo has co-authored, co-edited, and authored a number of books on this subject matter.\n\nIn 1998, Soludo was appointed to the position of professor of economics at the University of Nigeria; the next year he became a visiting professor at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nSoludo joined the Federal Government in 2003. Prior to his May 2004 appointment to the bank chairmanship, he held the positions of Chief Economic Adviser to former President Obasanjo and Chief Executive of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria.\n\nOn September 16, 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Soludo as a member of a newly formed 8-member Economic Advisory Council (EAC) which would report directly to the President.\n\nIn September 2009, Soludo announced his aspiration for the seat of the Governor of Anambra State\u2019s election of February 9, 2010. On October 9, 2009, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) chose Soludo as their consensus candidate for the position from a field of 47 candidates, after repeated attempts to hold elective primaries were stalled by court injunctions. However, his nomination was contested by 23 of the 47 aspirants, citing lack of transparency in the process.\n\nAfter the initial rancour, 36 out of the 47 candidates, and several top shots of the PDP affirmed their support for Soludo on Wednesday, October 14, 2009. Soludo went on to lose to Peter Obi in an election which was largely considered free and fair according to major election observers. However, with his perceived solid performance as CBN governor, Soludo remains a respected economic policy authority in Nigeria. Political commentators, while urging an issue-based campaign in the 2011 election, had called on aspirants to work with respected economists like Soludo towards an acceptable economic plan.\n\nOn 17 July 2013, Soludo resigned from the People\u2019s Democratic Party after writing a letter to the National Chairman of the party, Bamanga Tukur. He later joined the All Progressives Grand Alliance in preparation for the November 2013 governorship race in Anambra State. In mid-August 2013, he, along with five other qualified aspirants, was disqualified by the APGA Screening Committee.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, unidentified gunmen disrupted an interactive session between Isuofia youths and Soludo at the town\u2019s civic centre, leading to the death of three police officers.\n\nIn February 2021, Soludo officially declared his intention to run for the position of Governor of Anambra State under the banner of APGA.\n\nValentine Ozigbo\n\nValentine Chineto \u201cVal\u201d Ozigbo was born July 20, 1970.

That fatigue is certain not only in Nigeria but in other countries. I want to appeal to elders all over the country to encourage vaccination among their people.\n\n\u201cThe vaccines are certified by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and also tested by other countries\u2019 regulatory agencies, and these checks have assured that the vaccines are safe and effective for use.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Edo State Governor represented by his Chief of Staff, Hon.

This underscores our decision to take the bold unwavering stance to get as many people as possible vaccinated so that we do not stretch our healthcare system and trigger a collapse.\u201d\n\nObaseki said, \u201cOur target in Edo is to get a minimum of 60 percent of our population fully vaccinated within the next one year so that we can effectively combat the pandemic. I implore everyone to get vaccinated. That way, we can save lives and be able to return to living our normal lives. We want to appreciate everyone in the state who has taken the COVID-19 vaccine; the numbers are quite encouraging.\n\n\u201cWe urge those who are yet to get the vaccines to visit the nearest vaccination posts set up in worship centres, hotels, banks, event centres, markets, shopping malls and other strategic locations,\u201d he added.\n\nThe World Health Organisation Country representative for Development Partners and Donors, Dr. Walter Molumbo, said that the townhall meeting provided an opportunity to discuss the importance of vaccination.\n\n...",

Supo Ayokunle, has done.\n\n\u201cI am aware of your collaboration with the leadership of the Islamic and other faiths, to reconcile where there are conflicts, to pacify where there has been offence, and to reprimand where there have been misdeeds. Well done and congratulations.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on dousing religious and ethnic tensions in the society, the VP said \u201cas we have seen in the past few years not just in Nigeria but all over the world, there is a growing religious and ethnic chauvinism.\n\n\u201cAn almost intemperate, vehement and often violent dismissal of the views of people of other persuasions without adequate consideration. At the same time there is the rise of identity and cultural politics. Brethren, the answer to hate, intolerance and conflict is the gospel of Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nOn the call by CAN for the renovation of the National Christian Centre, Prof. Osinbajo gave a short presentation on renovation plan for the Centre, assuring that Christian groups and individuals would be mobilized to provide resources and complete the project.\n\nResponding personally and also on behalf of other award recipients, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cI accept the award with great humility, being mindful that we are not necessarily the most deserving of Christians to be given any recognition. But that because of the special grace of God, by which we have been chosen to serve in the high capacities that we serve, we are in the advantageous position that our contributions will be more easily noticed.\u201d\n\nThe VP dedicated the award to \u201cthe many who, daily, in different locations, distant and near, propagate this message of the love and reconciliation of the gospel of Jesus Christ in sometimes difficult, even life-threatening situations. And to the many who have suffered deprivation, and the families of those who have lost their lives by reason of their belief.\u201d\n\nPresenting the Award of Excellence to the VP, CAN President, Rev. Supo Ayokunle, said the honour was in recognition of Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s outstanding performance in public service over the past years, both at state and national levels.\n\nHe said: \u201cthis Award of Excellence is conferred on you today in recognition of your invaluable contributions as an ideal Christian in the Nigerian political space and governance.\u201d\n\nOther award recipients include former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo; former Imo State Governor, Sen. Rochas Okorocha; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara; several State governors; faith leaders, including past Presidents and General Secretary of CAN.\n\nThe Imam that saved the lives of over 200 Christians in Barkin Ladi, Plateau State, Abdullahi Abubakar, also received a special CAN recognition. It would be recalled that the VP had received the Imam at the Presidential Villa in May 2019 and praised him severally in public for his acts of courage, sacrifice and tolerance when he stuck out his neck to protect Christians who were being pursued to be attacked during a conflict situation in Barkin Ladi on June 23, 2018.\n\nEarlier on Saturday morning, the Vice President participated virtually in the 6th edition finals of the SimmonsCooper Advocacy Development (SCAD) Programme organized by SimmonsCooper Partners (SCP).\n\nSpeaking briefly during the event which was held live in Lagos, the VP congratulated the finalists of the SCAD competition as being among the best in Nigeria and anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cKnowledge is so critical, and today, it is almost as if a completely new vista of knowledge has been opened, especially with technology and all of its various implications,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was attended by members of the Nigerian Bar Association, students of law and other disciplines from Nigerian universities, members of the Nigerian business community, among others.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele has said the country\u2019s infrastructure has to improve for it to stimulate productivity and sustainable growth.\n\nMr Emefiele, who was represented by the apex bank\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications, Mr Osita Nwasinobi, made spoke while giving the keynote address at the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria\u2019s (FICAN) 30th-anniversary conference and awards which had the theme: \u201cFinancing Infrastructure & SMEs for inclusive growth in the post-COVID-19 economy,\u201d held in Lagos on Saturday.\n\nHe explained that despite being a sector of the economy which has been a major driver of growth, innovation and job creation, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) potential to spur growth and create jobs has been hampered by lack of access to quality infrastructure.\n\nThe CBN governor noted that though countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been spending about 6 \u2013 12 per cent of their GDP annually on infrastructure, Nigeria has been projected to need US$100 billion investment to fix its infrastructural gap annually for the next 30 years, which is currently estimated to be about 1.2 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u201cBeyond infrastructure, access to finance remains one of the biggest threats to MSME development in both developed and developing economies alike, with serious implications for productivity, economic development, and job creation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Emefiele further asserted, \u201cThe financing gap for MSMEs in Nigeria is estimated to be about N617.3 billion annually pre-Covid-19 pandemic, as less than 5 percent of these businesses have access to adequate finance to support their working capital and business expansion needs (PwC).\n\n\u201cOther constraints to MSME development in Nigeria, as noted in the survey, included difficulty in finding customers, infrastructure deficit, insufficient cash flows, multiple taxations, regulatory burden, and sub-optimal implementation of the provisions of the MSME policy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Emefiele revealed that the apex bank has put in place several policy measures to stimulate economic growth and reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Nigerians and its intervention efforts represented about 3.5 per cent of the GDP.\n\nHe reiterated that the CBN has remained committed to fulfilling its developmental mandate by collaborating with stakeholders across infrastructure and MSME segments in order to boost domestic output.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need for fiscal authorities to collaborate with the Central Bank of Nigeria to change the lenses through which they look at MSMEs and infrastructure development by developing innovative policy measures to unlock the potential of these enterprises to drive innovation and industrialisation.\n\n\u201cDistinguished ladies and gentlemen, without adequate infrastructure, the Nigerian economy cannot overcome its structural challenges and achieve growth, as well as development,\u201d the CBN Governor opined.\n\nIn his own remarks, the Managing Director/CEO, Heritage Bank, Mr Ifie Sekibo, who was represented by Olusegun Akanji, Divisional Head, Strategy and Business Solutions, argued that the government cannot solve the country\u2019s infrastructure challenges, noting that it is the private sector that will deliver the solution.\n\n\u201cThe government can only provide enabling policies that will support private sector interventions. We need the global private sector intervention to help us achieve a vision of infrastructural development,\u201d he noted.\n\nMr. Sekibo said until the country developed an identity management system that delivers value to the citizenry, SMEs will continue to grapple with financing challenges.\n\nHe explained that though the banking industry has financed a lot of SMEs in terms of count, that it is the sector that has the largest numbers of bad loans and frauds in terms of count.\n\nMr Bola Koko, Managing Director of FMDQ Group, represented by Yomi Osinubi, Head Private Market, urged Nigeria to conceive a way its domestic capital market could fund the international capital market.\n\nThat, he said, was the only way that we could pluck the infrastructure rewards.\n\n\u201cIf we want to pluck our infrastructure rewards, first of all we have to conceive of a way our domestic capital market can actually fund capital market.\n\n\u201cBut the investors in debt capital market international and debt, money will come into an environment where capital is expected and there is an expectation of good management of those resources and cash flows will come back to it.\n\n\u201cSo, I think there\u2019s the issue of maybe an underlying structure where we want to put in capital like road infrastructure tax payment.\n\n\u201cIf you want SMEs to get the best benefits of infrastructure development in the country, the CBN Governor mentioned the largest areas of course for SMEs which is energy. The second largest is the logistics, movements of cargo around the country,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Temidayo Obisan, Executive Commissioner representing the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), advised that the nation connected the right duration of money which according to him would be long-term.\n\n\u201cThe major thing to identify is that infrastructure is a long-term thing, so it is essential we connect the right duration of money which is long term capital which is what capital market provides and which sec as a regulator should,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have about three surviving infrastructure focus funds in Nigeria now that are totalling almost a 100bn, itching about 90 billion at the moment and there are some that are registered programmes of 200 billion.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman of FICAN, Titus Chima Nwokoji, said if Nigeria\u2019s infrastructural gap, which is estimated to be N36 trillion annually, is addressed, a lot of the country\u2019s economic challenges will be easily tackled.\n\n\u201cAnd coming out of COVID-19 pandemic, we know that if the infrastructure is fixed and SMEs thrive, the growth that you see will be faster,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Nigerian-British boxer, Anthony Joshua was on Saturday night, beaten by Oleksandr Usyk who put on a master class in the ring to collect Joshua\u2019s trio of heavyweight titles\n\nThe former undisputed cruiserweight champion, Usyk shook up the heavyweight division, and with tears in his eyes raised his arms in the center of the ring after the decision.\n\nUsyk (19-0, 13 KOs) set a hellacious pace from the jump to land the cleaner and heavier shots to outbox Anthony Joshua (24-2, 22 KOs) and relieve him of his WBO, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles. Despite no knockdowns, the fight was a thriller in front of nearly 68,000 fans at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium outside of London, CBS Sports reported.\n\n\u201cThis means much for me, a lot,\u201d Usyk said. \u201cThe fight went exactly the way I expected it to go. There were a couple of moments when Anthony pushed me hard but nothing special.\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old Usyk threw a major wrench in the division\u2019s plans to crown the first undisputed champion of the four-belt era. Joshua, 31, was supposed to face WBC and lineal champion Tyson Fury this summer but plans were canceled after Deontay Wilder won a court injunction to invoke a trilogy bout against Fury for Oct. 9.\n\nInstead of setting up plans for an all-England summit for the undisputed title, the next development besides Wilder-Fury III will be whether Joshua accepts his own contractually obligated rematch against Usyk.\n\n\u201cI have been working so hard since January in preparation for this fight,\u201d Usyk said. \u201cIt took me some half a year and I didn\u2019t see my family for so long. I miss my children and I miss watching them play. I want to go home and be happy and I\u2019m not thinking about the rematch at this second.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough boxing and MMA? Get the latest in the world of combat sports from two of the best in the business. Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news, including instant analysis of Usyk\u2019s shocking victory over Joshua on Saturday night in London below.\n\nJoshua, who had a swollen right eye that was threatening to close late in the fight, did not speak in the aftermath as he sought medical care. But promoter Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport ultimately believes his fighter will seek a second bout.\n\n\u201cThe rematch is going to be tough but there is nowhere to hide,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cAJ is at the stage of his career where he wants his world championship and he\u2019s already talking about it now. The doctors are talking to him. To me, it looks like a damaged eye socket. He says he\u2019s fine but he told me he couldn\u2019t see from about the ninth round on.\u201d\n\nUsyk, who had both swelling below his right eye and a cut above it, was able to set a tone in the early rounds with hard and accurate left crosses that Joshua could be in trouble if he stood in front of him. Joshua was repeatedly backed up by left hands and his legs buckled a bit late in Round 3.\n\nYet Usyk stayed true to his game plan and never went for the finish.\n\n\u201cI had no objective to knock him out because my trainers pushed me not to do that,\u201d Usyk said. \u201cIn the beginning, I hit him hard but my corner said to just stop and do my job.\u201d\n\nIn just his third heavyweight fight and first since closely outpointing Dereck Chisora last fall, Usyk raised his game to a completely higher level against Joshua. He did so with constant feinting to disarm his opponent and turn him into a counterpuncher. Yet Usyk operated at close distance the whole time and relied on his defense and head movement to slide away from big shots.\n\nThe only question as the first half rolled on became whether Usyk could keep up the pace. To Joshua\u2019s credit, he rallied nicely in the middle rounds as Usyk slightly began to fade. Joshua took the sting off of his shots and merely touched Usyk with the jab. It opened up opportunities for Joshua to land big shots to the body to slow down Usyk\u2019s movement.\n\nYet on the night of his 12th wedding anniversary, the greatest trick Usyk pulled was never allowing Joshua to build upon any momentum by coming out the next round and simply being busier. With the fight possibly up for grabs entering the final round, Usyk backed Joshua up from the start and battered him against the ropes late to remove any doubt.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the best Usyk, I can be much better,\u201d Usyk said.\n\nUsyk joined Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko as the only Ukrainian-born heavyweight champions. Joshua, meanwhile, suffered just his second pro defeat following an upset TKO loss to Andy Ruiz Jr. In 2019 that he avenged later in the year.\n\n\u201cWe talked about overthinking it and getting too technical,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cHe tried to do that with arguably one of the pound-for-pound top fighters in the world. Tonight, Usyk was fantastic. I don\u2019t think this was a great performance from AJ when he looks back but was that the brilliance of Oleksandr Usyk? Joshua looked tired as the fight went on and he looked tired a little bit. Was that the mental fatigue of Usyk\u2019s work?\n\n\u201cUsyk was busier than I expected him to be. I thought he had the perfect game plan and tonight he makes history as the unified heavyweight world champion. You have to take your hat off to him. This is sport and the better man won.\u201d\n\nUsyk outlanded Joshua by a margin of 148 to 123, according to CompuBox.\n\nElsewhere on the undercard, Lawrence Okolie continued his dominant run at cruiserweight with a third-round TKO of Dilan Prasovic. The WBO champion, who is just 28 years old, made quick work of Prasovic, who was in his first real step-up bout to date as a previously unbeaten fighter. Plus, former WBA super middleweight champion Callum Smith made a thunderous debut at light heavyweight with an electric knockout of Lenin Castillo. Smith finished off Castillo in the second round with a devastating punch that left Castillo seizing on the ground. He was stretchered out of the ring in a scary scene.\n\nCBS Sports was with you throughout the entire way on Saturday, so. be sure to follow along with the live results and highlights below.\n\nFight card, results\n\nOleksandr Usyk def.

          "text": "The British High Commission in Nigeria has said that the new rules for international travel into the United Kingdom announced on Saturday by the High Commissioner, Catriona Laing, will subject Nigerians and national of others countries to pre-departure COVID-19 test.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by Atinuke Akande-Alegbe, Senior Communications & Public Diplomacy Officer, British High Commission, Abuja, said this clarification became necessary following the interests and perhaps anxiety the decision generated from members of the Nigerian public.\n\nThe statement said that from 4 October, all travellers to England from the majority of countries that are currently on the amber list, including Nigeria, \u201cmust take a pre-departure COVID-19 test \u2013 to be taken in the 3 days before travel, book and pay for day 2 and day 8 COVID-19 tests \u2013 to be taken after arrival, complete a passenger locator form \u2013 any time in the 48 hours before arrival.\n\n\u201cAfter they arrive, travellers must quarantine/self-isolate at home or in the place they are staying for 10 days, take a COVID-19 test on or before day 2 and on or after day 8\u201d\n\nThe UK said it understands that there has been some frustration that the new travel rules will continue to require people travelling to the UK from Nigeria to quarantine despite having received two doses of recognised COVID-19 vaccines in Nigeria.\n\nIt however, noted that it is working with the United States and the European Union to recognise Nigeria\u2019s vaccine certificate.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of our long-term partnership \u2013 we are working with Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to ensure that this happens as soon as possible, \u201cthe statement said.\n\nIt said further that \u201cFrom 4am Monday 4 October 2021, the rules for international travel to England will change from the red, amber, green traffic light system to a single red list of countries and simplified travel measures for arrivals from the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cAll travellers who have been in a country or territory on the red list in the 10 days prior to travelling, will only be allowed to enter the UK if they are a British or Irish national or if they have residence rights in the UK. On arrival they must quarantine in a managed hotel, and take 2 COVID-19 tests. Further details are available on the gov.uk website.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that travellers may be able to end quarantine/self-isolation early if they pay for a private COVID-19 test through the Test to Release scheme.\n\n\u201cFrom 4 October, vaccinated travellers from a small number of countries and territories \u2013 the majority of which are currently on the green list \u2013 will be exempt from quarantine and from certain testing requirements, provided they can prove their vaccination status and other requirements are met, including having booked a day 2 test.\n\n\u201cThis approach will be kept under regular review and further changes are likely as part of a phased opening up of international travel for vaccinated travellers. The UK is committed to opening up international travel and we are using our COVID-19 vaccine certification process to enable all those wishing to enter the UK to do so safely,\u201d it said.",

          "text": "Germany\u2019s Social Democrats narrowly won Sunday\u2019s national election, projected results showed, ending 16 years of conservative-led rule under Angela Merkel.\n\nThe Democrats said they have a \u201cclear mandate\u201d to lead a government for the first time since 2005, with Olaf Scholz as chancellor.\n\nThe centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) were on track for 26.0% of the vote, ahead of 24.5% for Merkel\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative bloc, projections for broadcaster ZDF showed, but both groups believed they could lead the next government.\n\nWith neither major bloc commanding a majority, and both reluctant to repeat their awkward \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of the past four years, the most likely outcome is a three-way alliance led by either the Social Democrats or Merkel\u2019s conservatives.\n\nAgreeing a new coalition could take months, and will likely involve the smaller Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP).\n\n\u201cWe are ahead in all the surveys now,\u201d the Social Democrats\u2019 chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz, said in a round table discussion with other candidates after the vote.\n\n\u201cIt is an encouraging message and a clear mandate to make sure that we get a good, pragmatic government for Germany,\u201d he added after earlier addressing jubilant SPD supporters.\n\nThe SPD\u2019s rise heralds a swing left for Germany and marks a remarkable comeback for the party, which has recovered some 10 points in support in just three months to improve on its 20.5% result in the 2017 national election.\n\nScholz, 63, would become the fourth post-war SPD chancellor after Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder. Finance minister in Merkel\u2019s cabinet, he is a former mayor of Hamburg.\n\nScholz\u2019s conservative rival Armin Laschet, signalled his bloc was not ready yet to concede, though his supporters were subdued.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t always been the first-placed party that provided the chancellor,\u201d Laschet, 60, told the round table.\n\n\u201cI want a government where every partner is involved, where everyone is visible \u2013 not one where only the chancellor gets to shine,\u201d he said in an early attempt to woo smaller parties.\n\nSchmidt ruled in the late 1970s and early 1980s in coalition with the FDP even though his Social Democrats had fewer parliamentary seats than the conservative bloc.\n\nCOALITION FOR CHRISTMAS?\n\nAttention will now shift to informal discussions followed by more formal coalition negotiations, which could take months, leaving Merkel in charge in a caretaker role.\n\nScholz and Laschet both said they would aim to strike a coalition deal before Christmas.\n\nMerkel plans to step down after the election, making the vote an era-changing event to set the future course of Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nShe has stood large on the European stage almost since taking office in 2005 \u2013 when George W. Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair British prime minister.",

          "text": "The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly, claiming Boko Haram terrorists were emboldened under his watch.\n\nIn a statement, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, said the caucus had extensively reviewed the President\u2019s address at the 76th session of the UNGA, noting that it is in \u201ccomplete disagreement with the ugly reality of the failures of his administration, as well as the economic, security and social ruins that have confronted the nation under his watch\u201d.\n\nElumelu said the caucus was \u201calarmed by President Buhari\u2019s report to UNGA that terrorists have been so weakened in Nigeria that they are now preying on soft targets, when in reality, insurgents have become so emboldened under his watch\u201d.\n\nAccording to the statement issued on Saturday, the insurgents are now attacking military formations, kidnapping and killing the nation\u2019s gallant officers while overrunning communities and murdering our citizens without restraint.\n\nAs representatives of the people, the Minority caucus expressed regret that President Buhari\u2019s speech did not reflect on the kidnapping and killing of students in Nigeria.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers argue that Buhari did not reflect the closure of schools and crippling of education in some parts of the country, where normal life has been destroyed by terrorists, neither did it show any empathy towards the victims of terrorism attacks.\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari Addresses World Leaders At UN General Assembly\n\n\u2018No Personal Commitment\u2019\n\n\u201cOur caucus is worried that in reflecting on violent conflicts, Mr. President\u2019s address conveyed no personal commitments that can guarantee an end to poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities, that are prevalent under his watch, even after identifying such as the causes of conflicts,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\n\u201cAlso, the minority caucus is shocked by the claims in Mr. President\u2019s speech that his administration \u201cbuilt\u201d isolation centers and emergency hospital wards, \u2018all over the country\u2019 \u2018in record time\u2019 in the fight against COVID-19; a claim that is in conflict with the infrastructural reality in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our caucus is worried that Mr. President\u2019s speech did not portray any decisive road map towards economic recovery and food security; had no personal commitment to end corruption in his administration; had no personal commitment to end borrowing or show a clear-cut plan to repay the huge debt being accumulated by his administration.\u201d\n\nOn the 2023 general elections in the country, the opposition accused the President of lacking what it described as the definite personal commitments towards credible electoral process.\n\nThe Minority caucus therefore asked President Buhari to always cross check the content given to him by his handlers so as to ensure that his position, especially on the world stage, captures the reality as well as aspiration prevalent in the country.\n\nThis to them, is because such addresses ought to serve as an unblemished working document for interventions and solutions at various levels of governance.",

We have a congress (where) anything goes. Where is the legislature? A legislature that cannot speak, a legislature where anything they bring is right?\n\n\u201cA legislature that cannot say that Nigeria has gotten to the age of conducting a free and fair election, a legislature that will close your eye anytime they bring money, borrow you borrow.\n\n\u201cWhere are the courts? The courts have been intimidated; the judges have abandoned their responsibilities out of fear of what will happen,\u201d Wike said.",

The fight went the way I expected it to go. There were moments when Anthony pushed me hard but it was nothing special,\u201d said Usyk, who now follows brothers Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko in becoming a Ukrainian world heavyweight champion, via a translator.\n\n\u201cI had no objective to knock him out because my corner pushed me not to do that. In the beginning, I tried to hit him hard, but then I stuck to my job.\u201d\n\nThere is a rematch clause, with Joshua \u2014 who has now won 24 and lost two of his professional bouts \u2014 having previously lost his belts when beaten by Andy Ruiz in New York in June 2019 only to regain the titles in a rematch in Saudi Arabia six months later.\n\nEddie Hearn, Joshua\u2019s promoter, told Sky: \u201cI have spoken to him (Joshua) and it was a tough fight. He is devastated.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Oleksandr Usyk\u2026 He put in a great performance and the better man won.\n\n\u201c(Joshua) never really got going, he will go to hospital now, I don\u2019t know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn\u2019t look great.\u201d\n\nBut Hearn added: \u201cThe fighter in AJ is already talking about winning the rematch.\u201d\n\nJoshua later tweeted, writing: \u201cKeep positive even if the world\u2019s crumbling in front of you! London, I love you & thank you each and every time!\u201d\n\nAnd despite defeat, he was backed to bounce back by Lennox Lewis, a former three-time world heavyweight champion.\n\nREAD ALSO: Fury-Wilder Reach Tentative Agreement For Third Fight: Report\n\n\u2018Learn from This\u2019\n\n\u201cGotta give it up to @usykaa on a great tactical performance tonight. For @anthonyjoshua it\u2019s not the end of the road, but u can\u2019t be so tentative or wait till the 8th round to turn it on. Learn from this and improve,\u201d Lewis tweeted.\n\nAt 34, Usyk is three years older than Joshua and he was also giving away three inches in height as well as nearly 20lbs (nine kilogrammes) in weight.\n\nJoshua appeared relaxed during a protracted ring walk that saw him shaking hands with fans.\n\nBut Usyk moved well right from the opening bell and the southpaw staggered Joshua with a powerful left-hand punch to the head in the third round.\n\nUsyk\u2019s left hand continued to prove potent throughout a contest where a slimmed down Joshua did not appear to gain much resulting benefit in ring speed while at the same time lacking power in his punches.\n\nBy the end of the tenth round, there was swelling under Joshua\u2019s right eye.\n\nUsyk backed Joshua onto the ropes late on and appeared poised for a knockout when the final bell sounded.\n\nAFP",

This is a major first step towards closing our energy access deficit by 2030.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s commitment is also reflected in the development of our Energy Transition Plan, which was developed with the support of the UK COP26 Energy Transition Council.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari appealed to developed countries for assistance in unlocking the funds required to advance a just and equitable energy transition for all.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe focus of our discussions on transition must now evolve how we help countries develop detailed energy transition plans and commitments to mobilize enough financing to empower countries to implement those plans.\u201d\n\nThe president further said: \u201cThe scale of financing required for Nigeria to achieve net-zero, amounts to over $400 billion across the Nigerian economy in excess of business-as-usual spending over the next thirty years.\n\n\u201cThis breaks down to $155 billion net spent on generation capacity, $155 billion on transmission and distribution infrastructure, $75 billion on buildings, $21 billion on industry and $12 billion on transport.\u201d\n\nHowever, the President stated that before gas is phased out, it would continue to play an important role, emphasizing that solid fuel cooking is still wreaking havoc in Africa:\n\nHe added: \u201cAs a global leader on the energy transition, it is imperative that I flag a major risk to development that stems from the current narrative around the energy transition, particularly on the role of gas and the lack of financing.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Energy Transition Plan has laid out our roadmap to reach net-zero and highlights the scale of the effort required, which includes the development and integration of renewables into current grid infrastructure at tremendous scale and electrification of all sectors.\n\n\u201cThis is challenging for any country especially a developing country. On our development objectives, gas will have a key role to play here for some years before being phased out.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari stated that these plans must also consider providing access to energy and clean cooking solutions to individuals in Nigeria and around the world who do not currently have access, emphasizing that these plans must be implemented as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cGlobally there are 2.6 billion people who lack access to clean cooking which is unacceptable,\u201d adding: \u201ceven more concerning is that solid fuel cooking in Africa causes almost 490,000 premature deaths annually, making it the second-largest health risk in Africa.\u201d",

          "text": "At least three people were killed Saturday afternoon when an Amtrak train that runs between Seattle and Chicago derailed in north-central Montana, toppling several cars onto their sides, authorities said.\n\nThe westbound Empire Builder train derailed about 4 p.m. near Joplin, a town of about 200, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said in a statement. The accident scene is about 150 miles (241 kilometers) northeast of Helena and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Canada.\n\nLiberty County sheriff\u2019s dispatcher Starr Tyler told The Associated Press that three people died in the derailment. She did not have more details. Amtrak said in a statement that there were multiple injuries.\n\nThe train had about 141 passengers and 16 crew members onboard, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said. The train had two locomotives and 10 cars, eight of which derailed, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nMegan Vandervest, a passenger who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told The New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,\u201d said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis. \u201cMy second thought was that\u2019s crazy. We wouldn\u2019t be derailing. Like, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nShe told the Times that the car behind hers was tilted, the one behind that was tipped over, and the three cars behind that \u201chad completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where some passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like \u201cextreme turbulence on a plane.\u201d\n\nResidents of communities near the crash site quickly mobilized to help the passengers.\n\nChester Councilwoman Rachel Ghekiere said she and others helped about 50 to 60 passengers who were brought to a local school.\n\n\u201cI went to the school and assisted with water, food, wiping dirt off faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThey appeared to be tired, shaken but happy that they were where they were. Some looked more disheveled than others, depending where they were on the train.\u201d\n\nA grocery store in Chester, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the derailment, and a nearby religious community provided food, she said.\n\nThe passengers were taken by buses to hotels in nearby Shelby, said Ghekiere, whose husband works for the local emergency services agency and was alerted to the crash.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board will send a 14-member team, including investigators and specialists in railroad signals and other disciplines, to investigate the crash, spokesman Eric Weiss said.\n\nWeiss said the derailment occurred around 3:55 p.m. and no other trains or equipment were involved. The train was traveling on a BNSF Railway main track at the time, he said.\n\nPhotos posted to social media showed rail cars on their sides and passengers standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage. The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.\n\nAmtrak said that because of the derailment, the Sunday westbound Empire Builder will terminate in Minneapolis, and the Sunday eastbound Empire Builder train will originate in Minneapolis.\n\nOther recent Amtrak derailments include:\n\n\u2014 April 3, 2016: Two maintenance workers were struck and killed by an Amtrak train going more than 100 mph in Chester, Pennsylvania. The lead engine of the train derailed.\n\n\u2014 March 14, 2016: An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago derailed in southwest Kansas, sending five cars off the tracks and injuring at least 32 people. Investigators concluded that a cattle feed delivery truck hit the track and shifted it at least a foot before the derailment.\n\n\u2014 Oct. 5, 2015: A passenger train headed from Vermont to Washington, D.C., derailed when it hit rocks that had fallen onto the track from a ledge. The locomotive and a passenger car spilled down an embankment, derailing three other cars and injuring seven people.\n\n\u2014 May 12, 2015: Amtrak Train 188 was traveling at twice the 50 mph speed limit as it entered a sharp curve in Philadelphia and derailed. Eight people were killed and more than 200 were injured when the locomotive and four of the train\u2019s seven passenger cars jumped the tracks. Several cars overturned and ripped apart.",

          "title": "Usyk Stuns Joshua By Unanimous Decision to Become Unified Heavyweight Champion",
          "text": "Oleksandr Usyk is the new unified heavyweight world champion after dethroning Anthony Joshua with an incredible performance in London.\n\nThe Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 65,000 fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, outclassing Joshua over 12 rounds, and hurting the defending champion on numerous occasions.\n\nThe scorecards \u2013 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 \u2013 were all for Usyk and there was a mere shrug of the shoulders from Joshua as the second defeat of his professional career was confirmed.\n\nHaving seen a fight with fellow Briton Tyson Fury collapse last summer, Joshua opted to face his WBO mandatory challenger and former undisputed cruiserweight champion Usyk instead.\n\nIt appeared the easier fight for Joshua, but boxing\u2019s triumphant return to stadium nights was soured for the home crowd by a truly exceptional performance from the challenger.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn suggested his fighter may have suffered a broken eye socket and would need to go to hospital.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn\u2019t look great,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t see after the ninth round, obviously he was getting tagged a lot as well.\u201d\n\nA devastated Joshua left the ring immediately after the decision but later posted a short message on Twitter, saying: \u201cKeep positive even if the world\u2019s crumbling in front of you! London I love you & thank you each and every time!\u201d\n\nJoshua was relaxed and cheerful as he approached the ring, but concentration was etched on his face from the first bell.\n\nUsyk\u2019s abilities quickly became apparent, the 34-year-old full of feints and pace from the off, moving Joshua around the ring at will as the defending champion settled into a surprisingly passive role.\n\nA few warning shots from Joshua fell short in the early rounds, Usyk either catching them with a glove or spinning away. It would become the pattern of the fight as Usyk made Joshua miss and executed a perfect gameplan of his own.\n\nA left cross from Usyk rattled Joshua in the third round, and prompted a noisy response from the crowd.\n\nJoshua rode the danger, failing to respond, but making it to the bell safely. Usyk was now brimming with confidence and the London crowd tried in vain to rouse their man into life.\n\nA low shot from Joshua brought a complaint from Usyk and Joshua fired off another, perhaps sensing a weakness in his opponent. Round five was Joshua\u2019s best to that point, but Usyk remained in control and the Briton continued to miss his attempts to land any meaningful shots.\n\nFinally, in the sixth round, Joshua landed his right hand, sparking a response form Usyk, who widened his stance and appeared ready to trade. Joshua backed off, wary of a firefight.\n\nAnd Joshua\u2019s fears were realised in the seventh as Usyk responded brilliantly to stun him with a left hook to the chin and send him stumbling backwards. Joshua stayed on his feet, surviving the round but now in a dire predicament.\n\nUsyk was comfortably ahead on the scorecards and Joshua struggled to close the gap. The huge weight advantage was nowhere in evidence, with Usyk keeping the fight at range and urgings from Joshua\u2019s corner to move forward appearing to fall on deaf ears.\n\nJoshua had Usyk briefly on the ropes in the ninth but returned to his corner with a bloody nose having caught a hard shot to the face in the closing seconds of the round.\n\nThere was blood on the faces of both men in the 11th round. Joshua had a cut and swelling on his eye; Usyk had a gash on his left eye. But while Usyk\u2019s mouth was open, he was by far the busier fighter in the penultimate round, outclassing Joshua with ease once again.\n\nThe crowd desperately tried to inspire the defending champion, who needed a knockout in the final round. But it was the challenger who almost found the decisive punch, pushing a dazed Joshua on to the ropes.\n\nThe bell saved Joshua from suffering another knockout defeat and there was a nervous wait for Usyk\u2019s team for the scorecards.\n\nThere were to be no more shocks, however, as all three judges gave it to the challenger and ended Joshua\u2019s short second reign as world champion after just one fight.\n\nIt is unclear where Joshua goes from here. There is a rematch clause, one that the two-time world champion is likely to exercise.\n\nHe now has two losses to his name and on both occasions the Briton was dominated by a smaller man. Usyk did not find the knockout punch, but he exposed Joshua\u2019s frailties and somewhat light attacking arsenal.\n\nJoshua had no answer to Usyk and while his opponent glided across the ring, the champion appeared to be dragging his feet through mud. There was no attempt to bully Usyk, wear him down or go to the body.\n\nIt was a strange, almost hapless display from Joshua which leaves his legacy as one of the heavyweight greats in ruins.\n\nAside from the Briton\u2019s long-term career prospects, Joshua versus Fury now appears to be dead.\n\nFury fights Deontay Wilder next month in Las Vegas and every fight fan\u2019s greatest fear has been realised after the unification bout collapsed last summer.\n\nTo begin with, Joshua will have to win his rematch with Usyk which, after Saturday night\u2019s meeting, appears a near impossible prospect.\n\nJoshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn said his fighter had given Usyk too much respect and would have to make \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to regain his titles.\n\n\u201cWe knew it [defeat] could happen if he didn\u2019t get it right, and he didn\u2019t get it right,\u201d Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cHe took too many shots early and Usyk was more aggressive than I thought he would be and he was the deserved winner.\n\n\u201cTony Bellew\u2019s comments about overthinking, and it fatiguing you, were right. It is like these last three or four days you get spellbound by Usyk and you end up giving him too much respect and that becomes a problem.\u201d\n\nHearn said Joshua was already thinking about how to beat Usyk next time.\n\n\u201cHe is going to go away and all he will do is think about Oleksandr Usyk. He will be thinking \u2018how can I beat him, how can I improve?\u2019 He is obsessed with improving,\u201d said Hearn.\n\n\u201cI just feel there is so much more Anthony Joshua in that fight but he will have to do a lot more in the rematch to be victorious.\u201d",

          "title": "Covid Vaccine Boosters Could Mean Billions for Drugmakers",
          "text": "Billions more in profits are at stake for some vaccine makers as the U.S. moves toward dispensing COVID-19 booster shots to shore up Americans\u2019 protection against the virus.\n\nHow much the manufacturers stand to gain depends on how big the rollout proves to be.\n\nU.S. health officials late on Thursday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for all Americans 65 and older \u2014 along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs.\n\nOfficials described the move as a first step. Boosters will likely be offered even more broadly in the coming weeks or months, including boosters of vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. That, plus continued growth in initial vaccinations, could mean a huge gain in sales and profits for Pfizer and Moderna in particular.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity quite frankly is reflective of the billions of people around the world who would need a vaccination and a boost,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.\n\nWall Street is taking notice. The average forecast among analysts for Moderna\u2019s 2022 revenue has jumped 35% since President Joe Biden laid out his booster plan in mid-August.\n\nMost of the vaccinations so far in the U.S. have come from Pfizer, which developed its shot with Germany\u2019s BioNTech, and Moderna. They have inoculated about 99 million and 68 million people, respectively. Johnson & Johnson is third with about 14 million people.\n\nNo one knows yet how many people will get the extra shots. But Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects boosters alone to bring in about $26 billion in global sales next year for Pfizer and BioNTech and around $14 billion for Moderna if they are endorsed for nearly all Americans.\n\nThose companies also may gain business from people who got other vaccines initially. In Britain, which plans to offer boosters to everyone over 50 and other vulnerable people, an expert panel has recommended that Pfizer\u2019s shot be the primary choice, with Moderna as the alternative.\n\nAndersen expects Moderna, which has no other products on the market, to generate a roughly $13 billion profit next year from all COVID-19 vaccine sales if boosters are broadly authorized.\n\nPotential vaccine profits are harder to estimate for Pfizer, but company executives have said they expect their pre-tax adjusted profit margin from the vaccine to be in the \u201chigh 20s\u201d as a percentage of revenue. That would translate to a profit of around $7 billion next year just from boosters, based on Andersen\u2019s sales prediction.\n\nJ&J and Europe\u2019s AstraZeneca have said they don\u2019t intend to profit from their COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\n\nFor Pfizer and Moderna, the boosters could be more profitable than the original doses because they won\u2019t come with the research and development costs the companies incurred to get the vaccines on the market in the first place.\n\nWBB Securities CEO Steve Brozak said the booster shots will represent \u201calmost pure profit\u201d compared with the initial doses.\n\nDrugmakers aren\u2019t the only businesses that could see a windfall from delivering boosters. Drugstore chains CVS Health and Walgreens could bring in more than $800 million each in revenue, according to Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds.\n\nJonas noted that the drugstores may not face competition from mass vaccination clinics this time around, and the chains are diligent about collecting customer contact information. That makes it easy to invite people back for boosters.\n\nDrugmakers are also developing COVID-19 shots that target certain variants of the virus, and say people might need annual shots like the ones they receive for the flu. All of that could make the vaccines a major recurring source of revenue.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines have already done much better than their predecessors.\n\nPfizer said in July it expects revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine to reach $33.5 billion this year, an estimate that could change depending on the impact of boosters or the possible expansion of shots to elementary school children.\n\nThat would be more than five times the $5.8 billion racked up last year by the world\u2019s most lucrative vaccine \u2014 Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar13, which protects against pneumococcal disease.\n\nIt also would dwarf the $19.8 billion brought in last year by AbbVie\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, widely regarded as the world\u2019s top-selling drug.\n\nThis bodes well for future vaccine development, noted Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nVaccines normally are nowhere near as profitable as treatments, Gordon said. But the success of the COVID-19 shots could draw more drugmakers and venture capitalists into the field.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine business is more attractive, which, for those of us who are going to need vaccines, is good,\u201d Gordon said.",

          "text": "The fight to succeed popular, long-serving chancellor Angela Merkel could barely be tighter as Germans go to the polls in parliamentary elections.\n\nThe streets of Berlin are hosting the annual marathon, but the biggest race is taking place across the country.\n\nIn a final push for votes, the outgoing chancellor joined conservative candidate Armin Laschet at a rally on Saturday in his hometown of Aachen.\n\nFinal opinion polls suggest an unlikely victory could be within their grasp.\n\nAt stake is the leadership of Europe\u2019s most powerful economy, and more than 60 million Germans over 18 are eligible to vote.\n\nA clear indication will come when voting comes to an end at 18:00 (16:00 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nThis unpredictable election looked over until Mrs Merkel entered the fray, her career at the top of German politics now weeks from coming to an end.\n\n\u201cIt really matters who\u2019s in power,\u201d she warned voters repeatedly in the 48 hours before the vote. Her message was that Germany needed stability and its youth needed a future \u2013 and Armin Laschet was the man to provide it.\n\nThere are plenty of uncertainties about this election. In the run-up, more than a third of voters were still unsure who to vote for, although a record number have already posted their votes in.\n\nFor months the opinion polls have swayed this way and that. The conservative CDU and its Bavarian sister party led initially, and at one point the Greens went in front, but then came a surge for the Social Democrats under Olaf Scholz.\n\nOf the three candidates competing for the role of chancellor it is Mr Scholz who has galvanised voters most. As Mrs Merkel\u2019s deputy it has been easier for him than for his conservative rival to be seen as the continuity candidate.\n\nBut even if he wins he will most likely need the support of two other parties to form a coalition.\n\n\u201cThe most important coalition for me is with the voters, because the stronger they make the SPD, the easier it will be for me to form a government,\u201d he says.\n\nFor the Greens this is their biggest moment yet. Climate change is currently the biggest issue for German voters and the party has only once polled more than 10% in a federal election.\n\nBut their candidate for the top job, Annalena Baerbock, has lost support over the summer, despite catastrophic floods that left at least 190 people dead and left a trail of destruction in two of the most populous states.\n\nJudging from a random sample of people in Berlin\u2019s sprawling Alexanderplatz on Saturday, even though climate change is their highest priority, they think the other parties are quite capable of addressing it too.\n\nConservative Armin Laschet told voters on Saturday it was time to speed up the move to renewable energy: \u201cWe\u2019re too slow in Germany.\u201d\n\nAction to tackle climate change needs to be just and fair, says German campaigner Luisa Neubauer.\n\nThe liberal FDP may disagree with the Greens on plenty, but on climate change they are drawing in young voters too. Both parties have a good chance of being in government and both could be kingmakers.\n\n\u201cThe next government is the last that can still have an active influence on the climate crisis,\u201d Annalena Baerbock warned Germans during one of the final TV debates, so the Greens had to be part of it, she said.\n\nBut liberal leader Christian Lindner does not believe Germany needs to go the same way as the Greens.\n\nEven if a clear winner emerges on Sunday evening, Germans will not know the make-up of their government for some time.\n\nThe victorious party still needs to form a coalition and there seems little chance of a repeat of the two-party grand coalition currently in charge.\n\nThat is why Germans are talking about traffic-light, Jamaica or Kenya coalitions, reflecting the different colour schemes of the parties potentially involved.\n\nIf it\u2019s the centre-left then look for the red, yellow and green; if it\u2019s the conservatives, it could be black, yellow and green.\n\nUntil that is all sorted Angela Merkel won\u2019t be going anywhere.\n\nBBC",
