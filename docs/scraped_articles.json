          "text": ".\n\nBy Sola Ogundipe\n\nThe breast milk of lactating mothers vaccinated against COVID-19 contains a significant supply of antibodies that may help protect nursing infants from the illness, new research from the University of Florida has shown.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that vaccination results in a significant increase in antibodies against COVID-19 virus in breast milk, suggesting that vaccinated mothers can pass on this immunity to their babies, something we are working to confirm in our ongoing research,\u201d said Dr Joseph Larkin III, senior author of the study published and an associate professor in the University of Florida/IFAS department of microbiology and cell science.\n\nThe study is published in the journal Breastfeeding Medicine and cell science.\n\n\u201cThink of breast milk as a toolbox full of all the different tools that help prepare the infant for life. Vaccination adds another tool to the toolbox, one that has the potential to be especially good at preventing COVID-19 illness,\u201d said Dr Josef Neu, co-author, and professor in the University of Florida College of Medicine\u2019s department of pediatrics, division of neonatology.\n\nHe said breast milk allows nursing mothers to provide infants with \u201cpassive immunity\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe results of our study strongly suggest that vaccines protect mother and baby, another compelling reason for pregnant or lactating women to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe study was conducted between December 2020 and March 2021, when the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines first became available to health care workers.\n\nFor the study, researchers recruited 21 lactating health care workers who had never contracted COVID-19.\n\nThe research team sampled the mothers\u2019 breast milk and blood three times: before vaccination, after the first dose, and after the second dose.\n\n\u201cWe saw a robust antibody response in blood and breast milk after the second dose \u2014 about a hundred-fold increase compared with levels before vaccination,\u201d said Lauren Stafford, a doctoral student in Larkin\u2019s lab.\n\n\u201cThese levels are also higher than those observed after natural infection with the virus,\u201d said Dr Vivian Valcarce, a resident in the UF College of Medicine\u2019s department of pediatrics, division of neonatology.\n\nBut vaccinating mothers to protect babies is nothing new, Valcarce said.\n\n\u201cTypically, expectant mothers are vaccinated against whooping cough and flu because these can be serious illnesses for infants. Babies can also catch COVID-19, so routine vaccination of mothers against the virus could be something we see in the future,\u201d Valcarce said.\n\nWith that in mind, the research team is continuing to explore how breast milk containing COVID-19 antibodies gained through vaccination protects babies who consume it.\n\n\u201cWe would like to know if infants who consume breast milk containing these antibodies develop their own protection against COVID-19,\u201d Larkin said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we would also like to know more about the antibodies themselves, such as how long they are present in breast milk and how effective they are at neutralizing the virus.\u201d\n\nNeu said his lab is also interested in exploring the potential therapeutic uses of breast milk produced by vaccinated mothers.\n\nUnanswered questions aside, the researchers remain excited and encouraged by their initial results.\n\n\u201cThere is still so much we are learning about breast milk and all its benefits, and that\u2019s what makes this research so fascinating \u2014 not just for us scientists but for non-scientists, too,\u201d said Stafford, who is pursuing a degree in microbiology and cell science in the UF/IFAS College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n..Police blame NUPENG members\n\n*Issuance of fake e-call up tickets, extortion, corruption cause of gridlock\u2013 NARTO\n\n.Motorists narrate the ordeal\n\n.As LASTMA suspends enforcement of One-Way on Oshodi-Apapa Exp\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni, Victor Ahiume-Young, Kingsley Adeboye & Godwin Oritse\n\nGOVERNOR Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s Traffic Committee on Apapa gridlock headed by his Special Adviser on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, has abandoned its primary duty as truck drivers continue to park indiscriminately along Oshodi-Apapa Expressway unchecked.\n\nAlso, the Electronic-call up system introduced by the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority, NPA, in collaboration with the state government to reorder the movement of trucks on a first come first serve basis seemed to have also collapsed as truck drivers ignored all earlier rules and regulations on traffic movement.\n\nThe state traffic management committee was set up to restore sanity to the persistent gridlock which had defied all solutions from the administrations of Messrs Babatunde Fashola and Akinwunmi Ambode, to date.\n\nHowever, as part of measures to curb the excesses, NPA had earlier sought the support and cooperation of Assistant Inspector General of Police, AIG of the Nigeria Police in charge of Maritime as well as the Nigerian Navy and Federal Road Safety Corps FRSC on the need to clear all encumbrance and bottlenecks that impede the free flow of traffic on all port corridors with a view to ensuring efficient and effective handling of cargo in and out of the nation\u2019s seaports.\n\nOn the Apapa Oshodi-Apapa Expressway, truck drivers occupied the road from Fatgbems Filling Station up to Trinity, inward Tin-can Island Port.\n\nThe chaotic traffic situation along Apapa-Oshodi Expressway returned, yesterday, as truck drivers parked indiscriminately on the road subjecting motorists and other road users to untold hardship.\n\nMen of the state traffic committee and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, LASTMA, practically abandoned their duty posts.\n\nOfficials of the traffic committee abandoned the bottlenecks leaving the traffic management to touts and miscreants who were openly extorting truckers before being allowed access towards the port road.\n\nAlso, some mean looking fellows were seen on traffic vests bearing \u201cNUPENG VIO,\u201d who claimed to be working for Nigeria Union of Petroleum, and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, in controlling the movement of trucks into Tin-can Port.\n\nPolice blame NUPENG members\n\nSome policemen, who spoke under anonymity, blamed personnel of the Lagos Police Command, LASTMA and NUPENG officials for the present gridlock along the expressway.\n\nThe situation got worse last Wednesday as truck and tanker drivers protested against giving bribes after paying different charges at several checking points mounted by union officials inward Apapa.\n\nThe protest resulted in lockdown between Mile-2 and Kirikiri Road junction thereby subjecting other road users to a standstill situation for several hours into midnight. The confusion was, however, cleared after the truck and tanker drivers agreed to part with some money before the vehicular movement was restored inward Apapa.\n\nMotorists narrate ordeal\n\nKenneth Adebisi, a motorist, who narrated his experience, said: \u201cDifferent people putting on different reflective jackets belonging to different labour unions were seen last Wednesday night at the Kirikiri junction. They were responsible for the confusion at the Kirikiri junction because they were the people that stopped a particular truck driver at the spot because the driver refused to pay a certain amount of money at the spot, thereby blocking the entire road.\n\n\u201cA particular truck driver was heard shouting at the Kirikiri junction that night that he had paid as much as N70,000 as charges at different checking point up to Kirikiri junction and was not ready to part with the slightest amount of money even if heaven would fall.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, policemen and LASTMA officials drafted to the area were at their location in front of UBA, by Kirikiri junction watching the confusion at the spot that night without any intervention. I had to turn back to the office to pass the night as there was no road to go home. \u201d\n\nSimilarly, Vanguard staff are often affected by the gridlock which lasts into the late hours after the close of work each day\n\n\u201cThe experience on this road is harrowing every day. When you are coming to the office in the afternoon, there is always gridlock as tanker drivers, who are supposed to be in a single lane to allow for other road users, take over the road leaving other motorists at their mercy in a standstill situation. Several petitions and appeals have been sent to the Governor and other relevant authorities to stop this corruption going on in the Apapa area but it seems all have fallen on deaf ears. We do not know who to turn to for help again. Apapa traffic management is a failed project,\u201d Mr. John narrated.\n\nNUPENG keeps mum\n\nEfforts to get the reaction from the leadership of NUPENG, as of press time, were unsuccessful.\n\nHowever, an official of the union who spoke in confidence promised to reach back to this reporter after getting the details. But at the time of this report was yet to get back.\n\nIssuance of fake e-call up tickets, extortion, corruption cause of gridlock\u2013 NARTO\n\nAlso, speaking on the development, a member of the National Executive Council of the National Association Road Transport Owners NARTO, Mr. Inuwa Mohammed, said that the extortion points along the Mile-2 axis of the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway were responsible for the present traffic situation being experienced along that corridor.\n\nInuwa also said that the traffic build up starts from Fatgbems filling station to Oto-Wolf and then Sunrise, thereby, resulting in gridlock.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is at these illegal checkpoints that fake electronic Call-Up tickets are issued. The security agents mounting these illegal extortion points have turned the place into their parking lots.\n\n\u201cThis syndicate hides under this illegal extortion to issue fake Call-Up tickets and I advise the authority to see how the system can regulate the movement of trucks and other articulated vehicles.\u201d\n\nC\u2019ttee boss reacts\n\nFayinka, who had earlier failed to respond to several calls and messages sent to him, in his response yesterday, said he had been too busy with other official duties.\n\nHe had earlier absolved his men of any complicity in the alleged extortion, pointing accusing fingers at regular state police from the division around the axis.\n\nIn his response, he said: \u201cWe have concluded plans to commence removal of all these trucks impeding traffic. I can assure you enforcement will continue.\n\n\u201cAlso, the ongoing road construction by Hitech Construction Company is a big problem to our work. We urge you to please join us in appealing to the Federal Ministry of Works to talk to Hitech to complete the construction of the port access road on time to enhance the free flow of traffic in Apapa and environs.\n\nLASTMA suspends enforcement of One-Way\n\nIn a related development, following series of complaints and passionate appeal by motorists over alleged indiscriminate arrest and extortion and intervention by Isolo Local Council Development Area, LCDA, the General Manager of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, LASTMA, Olajide Oduyoye, through the Director of Operations, Bolaji Oreagba, has ordered the suspension of driving against the flow of traffic popularly called \u201cOne-Way\u201d enforcement on Apapa-Oshodi service lane from Cele to Apakun Bridge.\n\nIn a memo by Oregba titled \u2018Suspension of One-Way\u201d enforcement on Apapa-Oshodi Expressway from Cele-DHL-Apakun Under-bridge\u2019, dated August 27, to all zonal heads of zone 4, 21, 27, Headquarters and Operations, urged officials and men of the Nigeria Police attached to team to ensure strict compliance.\n\nHe explained that the state government was overwhelmed by complaints from motorists plying the area especially due to the stress they incur as caused by the ongoing work on the damaged bridge which has affected the seamless flow of traffic.\n\nOregba, explained that enforcement of One-Way driving on the service lane was needless as he ordered the officials to suspend the exercise on Aswani, Ajao Estate under the bridge to DHL corridor forthwith.\n\nThe enforcement was unofficially communicated to motorists and other road users last Tuesday with many road users expressing shock and inconveniences being experienced as a result of One-Way enforcement.\n\nChairman of Isolo LCDA, Otunba Adebayo Olasoju had last Wednesday, held a meeting with top officials of LASTMA Zone 27.\n\nOlasoju, in a statement, explained that in addition to the meeting, other concerned government agencies would be reached for possible reversal of the one-way enforcement.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2013Begs warring communities to give peace a chance\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nThe Presidency last night threatened that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari was moving ahead with force to crush the perpetrators of the recent incidents of unrest in Plateau State.\n\nThis is as the President has pleaded to the people of Jos the Plateau State capital and other warring communities.to give peace a chance.\n\nThe presidency in a statement issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu assured all citizens that as a government, the administration was on top of events and was moving ahead with force to crush those behind the recent killings in the state.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cBut to achieve success, our communities must unite against these horrific attacks. Retributive violence is not the answer.\n\n\u201cWhile these troubled communities are being reinforced with security personnel, our religious, traditional and other community leaders must not allow the use of their spaces for the propagation of violence and incitement to violence.\n\n\u201cAttempts to simplify the reasons into a basic narrative may help raise donor-dollars for international NGOs, fill pages of overseas newspapers, and burnish foreign politicians\u2019 faith credentials: but this does not increase understanding, nor offer solutions. If anything, simplistic theorizing and finger-pointing makes the situation worse.\n\n\u201cIt is important both for Nigerians and the international community to appreciate that there are a multitude of factors attendant to these troubles.\n\n\u201cThere is the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorism, as well as the spate of kidnappings for ransom, transformed by some misinformed global media into a Muslim-on-Christian threat. Yet, in reality, there are no religious connotations at all when the primate purpose of these acts is to extract money.\n\n\u201cThen the herder-farmer clashes. While international voices and some Nigerian politicians who seek personal gain from division declare this a matter of religion, for those involved it is almost entirely a matter of access to water and land. Herders have moved their cattle and into contact with farmers for millennia.\n\n\u201cBut, increasingly, due to population pressure, the increased aridity of northern states, and climate change they are forced to travel further south to find grazing lands.\n\n\u201cThen, further afield in the south-East, IPOB is not struggling for freedom when they attack police stations and property, but rather committing acts of terrorism in order to steal money. IPOB is not defending Christians \u2013 as their highly-paid foreign lobbyists claim \u2013 when almost every citizen of those the states they terrorize is uniformly Christian. Yet mistakenly, and because the lobbyists for IPOB have duped them, some misguided foreign media and politicians believe it so.\n\n\u201cAs for Nigerians, what we need is to come together. And we must do this first and for the most part by our own hands, by casting asunder those who seek to divide us for their own nefarious financial and political gain.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Victor Ahiuma-Young\n\nPetroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN, has said oil workers are excited by the Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, recently signed into law by President Muhammad Buhari, saying it has ended the uncertainty in the sector among other benefits.\n\nPresident of PENGASSAN, Festus Osifo, in a chat, lamented that the uncertainty and confusion created by years of delay in signing the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, into law, halted fresh investment and led to disinvestment by some the International Oil Companies, IOCs.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB that was before the National Assembly for so many years created a lot of confusion in the industry because nobody knew what the rule of engagement would be.\n\n\u201cMost of the International Oil Companies, IOCs, held back their investments. When it was delaying over time, they moved their investments to other parts of Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause of the uncertainty that played in the Nigerian environment, Nigeria was not attracting investments.\n\n\u201cWith the signing of the bill, the most fundamental advantage is that it has stopped the uncertainty in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe uncertainty of what would the law be if I invest a particular amount; how much am I going to get, how much am I going to pay as tax, as royalty, as capital gain tax? PIA reduced that uncertainty.\n\n\u201cThere is a provision in the bill, which for us we think is novel. Another important provision is the environmental remediation fund and environmental remediation plan.\n\n\u201cIt states that as you are getting your license for oil prospecting, you will submit to either the commission or authority your environmental remediation plan and you will also be setting funds aside on a yearly basis into the fund.\n\n\u201cShould there be a spill, this fund will now be used in fixing it unlike before, where there is no fund when there is a spill there will now be a problem.\n\n\u201cTo eliminate the issue and to ensure that the Niger Delta, the pollution that we have currently does not increase much more, that fund that is set aside overtime will be used in doing some remediation work.\n\n\u201cIt is a good provision. Another good provision in the bill is also about the development of gas.\n\n\u201cBefore now our old laws, the Petroleum Act of 1959, did not make any provision relating to gas.\n\n\u201cBut in the current PIA, we have a provision\u2014 about 50 sections of the PIA\u2014 now fully dedicated to gas: how you develop gas, gas infrastructure, gas storage system and distribution, among others.\n\n\u201cBefore now, what we had about gas was the regulation and policies, but there was no concrete law that backs gas development but we have been able to address that now. Also in the PIA is an issue of gas flaring.\n\n\u201cBefore now, we had no concrete laws apart from regulations on gas flaring but today there is.\n\n\u201cOne salient point that is good is that the penalty on gas flaring will be paid by the company and used by the host community.\n\n\u201cThe community will be the direct beneficiary of the fund if you flare gas in a community, which we also think is good.\n\n\u201cAnother milestone is the provision of Incorporated Joint Venture, IJV. Before now we had a provision for a joint operating agreement between the IOCs and NNPC not backed by some laws.\n\n\u201chat the Act did, though optional, is to ensure companies incorporate the JV into Corporate Affairs Commission under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA law), which tends to reduce or eliminate the cash call that today, most companies are finding it difficult to live with.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the benefits amongst others as provided in the PIA.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The Chidi Ibeh led group said the governor has attracted a scourge of hatred to his government as a result of the controversial comment.\n\nThe 17 governors of the southern states had in a meeting held in Lagos on July 5, 2021, urged states in the region to ensure that the legislation against open grazing of cattle was put in place on or before September 1.\n\nBut Uzodimma during the week reportedly declared that there is no law forbidding open grazing by cattle rearers in the state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any law in Imo State for anti-grazing. But what we have done is that we are regulating grazing activities in Imo State under a partnership between our farmers and herders. They have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in my office and agreed to work together. And both parties are going about their businesses without interfering or causing any grievance or anger to each other,\u201dthe governor said.\n\nThe statement attracted the wrath of the Igbo apex socio-cultural group. In a statement signed by its Secretary General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the Igbo group said: \u201cOur suspicion had been reinforced with the continued absence of Governor Hope Uzodinma in the meetings of Southern Governors in Asaba and Lagos, which was intentional and premeditated to ambush the resolutions of the Southern Governors. He will never escape the venom of Ndigbo, as he will surely taste the retribution of God and wrath of the people as a confirmed saboteur and this will serve as a warning to any Igbo governor that will follow such a decision. They will never escape the wrath of the people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has been advised against giving an order that could polarize the country\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis advice was given by a renowned socio-political activist and critic, Chief Adesunbo Onitiri following the President\u2019s directive for the recovery of 368 grazing fields in 25 states.\n\nAccording to Chief Onitri, the directive would cause an avoidable clash between the President and the state governors.\n\n\u201cI beg to disagree with the recent Grazing Reserve Order of Mr President when considered alongside with the plea of Mr President with the Service chiefs not to make him fail in his governance.\n\n\u201cAny sane mind will find these two conflicting stand points very absurd. The Land Use Act which is part of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and which President Buhari swore to uphold firmly placed administration of land in the purview of state governors.\u201d",

          "title": "Southern govs open grazing ban: One voice, divided action",
          "text": "By Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri), Tony John (Port Harcourt), Okey Sampson (Umuahia), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Femi Folaranmi (Yenagoa), Obinna Odogwu (Awka), Paul Osuyi (Asaba), Judex Okoro (Calabar), Geoffrey Anyanwu (Enugu), Tony Osauzo (Benin), Oluseye Ojo (Ibadan), Joe Effiong (Uyo), Lukman Olabiyi (Lagos) and Priscilla Ediare (Ado-Ekiti)\n\nWhen the governors of Southern Nigeria met in Lagos State on July 5, they were in high spirits to get a lasting solution to the rising menace of deadly herders in the region. The governors had earlier met in Asaba, Delta State, where they took far-reaching decisions.\n\nThus, in one voice, the 17 governors in Lagos agreed to end open grazing of cattle in their various states in a final move to check the atrocities perpetrated by \u2018killer herders.\u2019\n\nThey consequently set a September 1 deadline for the various states to enact an anti-open grazing legislation, which they hoped would end incessant killing, kidnapping, maiming and rape of women by suspected herdsmen in the region.\n\nImmediately after the Lagos parley, Osun, Ondo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Enugu states put machineries in motion towards enacting an anti-open grazing law, which our investigation revealed is already existing in Abia, Ebonyi, Ogun, Oyo and Ekiti states. In Imo, during the administration of Achike Udenwa, a similar law existed, but it is not operational in the state.\n\nThe Imo situation became clearer when last week, its governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma broke away from the joint decision of the Southern governors to ban open grazing of cattle in their respective states by his public declaration at Aso Villa that Imo State has no law forbidding open grazing by Fulani herdsmen, even when the law already exists in the state.\n\nIn this report, Sunday Sun looks at the positions in the 17 states in the South three days to the S\u200eeptember 1 ban on open grazing in the region.\n\nImo\n\nIn Imo State, a law prohibiting open grazing is already in place . The bill was assented into law on January 19, 2007 by the then governor of the state, Chief Achike Udenwa.\n\nAccording Section 3 of the law, \u201cRearing of cattle on the streets, main roads, residential and commercial places in Owerri capital territory and cultivated areas identified as Restricted Areas in Imo State is hereby prohibited \u201c.\n\nWhile Section 4 says: \u201cA cattle rearer shall not take his cattle into cultivated farms within Imo State.\u201d\n\nPenalties of contravening Section 3 and 4 is contained in Section 5. According to the law, defaulters of Section 3 shall pay a fine of N50,000 while that of 4, the defaulter will not only compensate the owner, but will also be left at the discretion of the magistrate for further punishment.\n\nThe current state Commissioner for Information and Strategy who was also a member of the state assembly then, representing Oru West, Mr Declan Emelumba, attested to the existence of the law.\n\nBut Governor Uzodimma in a chat with newsmen in Abuja last Wednesday verbally set aside the Imo law and rather asked for synergy between herders and farmers in the state.\n\nThe governor who had earlier maintained a stand with the Southern governors on banning of open grazing in Southeast and South-south in a dramatic twist after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday announced that there is presently no anti-grazing law in the state.\n\nHowever, Uzodimma on Friday through a statement made by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Emelumba, said that he was quoted out of context in his comments at Aso Villa, agreeing that a law banning open grazing already exists in the state.\n\nRivers\n\nConsistent with his public perception as a no-nonsense state chief executive, Governor Nyesom Wike worked with the Rivers State House of Assembly to secure enactment of the Open Rearing and Grazing Prohibition Law, which he assented to at the Government House, Port Harcourt, recently.\n\nIn his remarks at the signing ceremony, Wike said it was inimical to development and peace for any state to condone open grazing, noting that cattle rearing is a form of agricultural business. He said that the law has provision for ranching, which would end the frequent clashes between herdsmen and farmers, resulting in killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt is no longer a story. All of us know what our people have suffered in terms of this open grazing. Today, all Nigerians have come to accept the reality that open grazing is no longer fashionable. Even our brothers in the North have agreed that it is no longer fashionable.\u201d\n\nAlso, Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Ikuinyi-Owaji Ibani, while presenting the bill to the governor for assent, said that the new law would serve as \u201ccure to the symptom and the disease of herders and farmers bloody conflict.\u201d\n\nAgreeing with Ibani, the Leader of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Martin Amaewhule, said that lawmakers delineated and gave speedy passage to the bill because of its relevance to the socio-economic progress of the state.\n\nThe law also forbade livestock owners or ranchers in the state from possessing or bearing licensed or unlicensed firearms within the vicinity of the ranch.\n\nReacting to the signing into law the anti-open rearing and grazing, Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state, Mr. Samuel Nwanosike, expressed optimism that the law would impact positively on the state.\n\nHe assured the people of the preparedness of the 23 local government areas of the state to enforce the law to the fullest. He said that with the law in place, the perennial herders and farmers crisis would become history.\n\nOn the key issue of enforcement, he said the government would definitely announce modalities for implementing the law in the 23 LGAs.\n\nAbia\n\nLong before the resolution of Southern governors, the \u201cControl of Nomadic Cattle Rearing and Prohibition of Grazing Routes/Reserve Law, had been in operation in Abia State since 2018, after Governor Okezie Ikpeazu signed the bill passed by the state assembly into law.\n\nThe law significantly stipulated that cattle could only be moved into the state by either road or rail haulage and also stated that movement of trade cattle to major towns in the state shall be by truck, trailers/vehicles or pickup vans. The law equally prohibited nomadic cattle rearing and abolished grazing routes in the state.\n\nConsequently, the law made it mandatory for any cattle found on any road in the state to be impounded by the appropriate authority or taken to the nearest ranch as may be provided by the appropriate authority in the state.\n\nThe law, which makes provision for ranch, stipulated that any violator would on conviction be liable to a fine of N200,000 or six months imprisonment or both.\n\nEnforcement of the law was bestowed on the police. However, the state Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu, expressed displeasure over the poor level of enforcement, which he described as unsatisfactory.\n\n\u201cThe police have the mandate to enforce the law and the level of enforcement presently is unsatisfactory. We are working on the security authorities to ensure satisfactory enforcement,\u201d Okiyi-Kalu said.\n\nIn the wake of continuing herders\u2019 activities in the state since the law came into force, there have been growing concerns over non-enforcement of the law.\n\nThere have been attacks on farmers by killer herdsmen in their farmlands in Ndi Okereke Abam in Ovukwu Autonomous Community, Arochukwu Local Government Area, which left scores of the indigenes critically wounded. Also, murderous herders attacked Ozuitem in Bende Local Government Area and killed scores of farmers.\n\nIn one of the incidents, the heartless attackers chopped off the fingers of Sunday Oru, one of the victims. Similarly, in Aba, a Fulani herdsman chopped off three fingers of a lady for daring to stop him from grazing his cattle on her farmland.\n\nOru told reporters that the herdsmen invaded their farmlands and fed their cattle with crops such as rice, cassava, okra and plantain.\n\nIn the Ozuitem incident just like in the one before it, the police did nothing when the affected communities reported the incidents. Instead the traditional ruler and some of the indigenes were detained at the police headquarters for allegedly killing the cattle.\n\nWith obvious disregard of the anti-open grazing law by the herders not abating, there appears to be no end in sight to the activities of the herders in the state.\n\nEbonyi\n\nEbonyi State was one of the first states in the Southeast zone to enact a law against open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe law became imperative following intermittent violent clashes between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in the state.\n\nThe law had been effective, but without serious enforcement until March 31, 2021 when suspected Fulani herdsmen attacked three communities in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state and killed over 20 persons.\n\nWorried by the development, Governor David Umahi directed council chairmen to use local vigilante groups in conjunction with security agencies in their various communities to enforce the state law against open grazing.\n\nUmahi, who had been very accommodating of the herders, expressed frustration and disappointment over the Ishielu killings and warned violent herders who were still within the state to leave immediately for their own safety.\n\nHe also directed the police to work with traditional rulers to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that our law against open grazing of cows is still operational. I am, therefore, directing the council chairmen and the traditional rulers to use the community vigilante in their council areas and localities to enforce this law. Security agencies should also help us to enforce this law,\u201d he said.\n\nBayelsa\n\nWhen the Bayelsa State House of Assembly passed the Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation Bill into law on March 9, 2021, Governor Douye Diri promptly assented to it the very next day, to demonstrate the abhorrence of the people to the atrocities committed by murderous herdsmen, who use cattle grazing as cover.\n\nThe law clearly and unequivocally stated that any herdsman found with arms, whether licensed or not, should be arrested. It also prohibited movement of cattle on foot from other parts of the country into the state.\n\nDiri, while signing the law, noted that its essence is to ensure harmonious living between cattle dealers and other inhabitants to forestall violent clashes being experienced in other parts of the country. He announced the establishment of a livestock management committee to regulate livestock activities in the state.\n\n\u201cFrom the commencement of the law, no person shall breed, rear or trade in livestock in the state in any other place as may be designated by the committee and approved by the state government,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the law having come into force, Diri warned that any person found engaging in open grazing of livestock would be deemed to have committed an offence, stating that the person would be arrested and prosecuted while the livestock would be impounded.\n\nOn March 17, one week after the law was signed, Diri inaugurated the implementation committee to enforce the law. The committee, which is headed by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr David Alagoa, has members representing various of security agencies in the state and traditional rulers.\n\nAlagoa in an interview said aside the initial hiccups of implementation all parties in Bayelsa are alive to their responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThere has been no violation of the law aside the first time when there was a violation. What we did as a committee was that we invited all parties involved -Miyetti Allah and Butchers Association \u2013 for a meeting. We all agreed on achievable milestones at each point in time. Though there were initial issues about compliance, but now everybody understands the law.\u201d\n\nOgun\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of its counterparts in some other states, the Ogun State House of Assembly passed into law a bill sponsored by Hon. Ganiyu Oyedeji, representing Ifo II State Constituency, to regulate animal grazing and the establishment of cattle ranches in designated grazing areas in the state.\n\nHowever, Governor Dapo Abiodun, as at the time of filing this report, had not assented to the bill, which the Speaker of the state assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, had directed the Clerk of the legislature to send a clean copy to the governor.\n\nUnder the bill passed by the assembly, a section prescribed a three-year jail term without option of fine, including the forfeiture of the herds of cattle or livestock under his/her control to the state government except within the permitted ranches.\n\nDelta\n\nIn a twist difficult to understand, Delta State, where the decision to ban open grazing in southern Nigeria was taken, is yet to pass requisite law. This has led to growing concern that it may not meet the deadline.\n\nMembers of the state legislature debated the private member bill titled, Delta State Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation, during the plenary and sent it to a committee on July 14 after it scaled through second reading.\n\nMr. Yakubu Reuben Izeze, representing Ughelli South sponsored the bill, which has been stalled in the Joint committees on Special Bills, Agriculture and Natural Resources since July 26 because the assembly adjourned plenary, which is slated to resume on September 21, 2021, exactly 20 days after the expiry of the September 1 deadline for southern states to enact laws on open grazing ban.\n\nWhen contacted on phone, Mr. Izeze requested a text message, which he responded to very late by simply confirming that the bill was still at the committee stage.\n\nOur correspondent, however, learnt that the bill is suffering a set back due to the demand by the Cattle Dealers Association that at least 30,000 square meters of land should be designated in each local government area for livestock breeding and sales across the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the civil Society organisation, Victor Ojei, has bemoaned the lack of security architecture and logistics to enforce the ban in the state, when the bill is eventually passed into law.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying anything, no security meetings with the public regularly, no empowerment of local vigilantes through traditional rulers who are closer to their people. Delta Hawk is under-staffed, it does not operate with drones for aerial surveillance.\n\n\u201cNo town hall meetings in each local government to get first hand information on the challenges they face from these Fulani herdsmen who go about the state kidnapping, raping, killing and committing all sorts of crime.\n\n\u201cA provision was made in the bill for land use for livestock owners or businesses in the state, but we are hoping that those who will benefit from this compliance with the Land Use Act of Nigeria will not end up violating it,\u201d he contended.\n\nAnambra\n\nAnambra State which has been under the throe of herdsmen has not enacted anti-open grazing law and there were no indications that the state would be coming with one anytime soon.\n\nSunday Sun learnt from the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C. Don Adinuba, that Governor Willie Obiano has not revealed his position on the matter.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take part in that meeting and the governor has not briefed me on it,\u201d Adinuba said.\n\nA member of the Anambra State House of Assembly representing Nnewi North Constituency, Nonso Okafor, confirmed that no executive bill on the matter had yet been sent to the assembly for consideration.\n\n\u201cAs of today, no such law has been passed in the House of Assembly. As of now, no bill has been presented because if it had been, it would go through 1st, 2nd and 3rd readings.\n\n\u201cI can tell you authoritatively that it hasn\u2019t come; except that it has come and it is still with the admin department. Such a bill has not been presented on the floor of the house\u201d, Okafor said.\n\nAsked why none of the members had thought about presenting one to the Assembly, he said: \u201cI actually put up a motion on that, to call the attention of the state government on the need for us to have an anti-open grazing law. But the motion was not debated before we went on recess.\n\n\u201cThat motion would bring about discussion for a bill. With the experience in the house, for such a bill to go faster, most times it comes as an executive bill or the house takes it up as a bill that needs urgent attention.\u201d\n\nCross River\n\nThe people of Cross River State may have to wait for a messiah to come to champion their desire to see the end of open grazing in the state.\n\nThe former Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, Rt Hon John Gaul Lebo, in a chat with Sunday Sun disclosed that the state was one of the earliest to pass the anti-open grazing law in 2017.\n\nSpeaking with Sunday Sun, Lebo, a two-time lawmaker and Speaker between 2015 and 2019, said that though the law was passed in the interest of the people, to protect the state\u2019s massive arable land, Governor Ben Ayade refused to assent to it.\n\nHe explained that the lawmakers rather opted for ranching because the state lacks empty landmass, adding that the culture of the people does not permit movement of cattle from one place to another because the people engage in arable cropping of cassava, yam, cocoyam and maize.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t support open grazing in our state. But if it is the culture in the North to move cattle around, no problem, they can do so there. The president under our present constitution does not have land to give to anybody because by the 1975 Land Use Act the lands are under the management of state governors.\n\n\u201cFor me I don\u2019t understand what makes the Presidency think that those cattle grazing routes are still in existence because those routes have been overtaken by development. Besides, to be talking of movement of cattle from state to state in this 21st Century Nigeria is inverse development and inverse engineering.\u201d\n\nEnugu\n\nNews of the introduction of the Anti-Open Grazing Bill on the floor of the Enugu State House of Assembly on August 10 brought joy to residents of the state especially those in the rural areas.\n\nThe executive bill, which was introduced by the Leader of the House, Hon. Ikechukwu Ezeugwu, who represents Udenu constituency, passed the first reading on the same day.\n\nWithin a week of introduction, the bill passed through the second reading and was committed to a joint committee comprising the House Committee on Agriculture, House Committee on Public Petitions, Ethics and Privileges and House Committee on Youths, Sports and Culture, with the Chairman of House Committee on Agriculture and member representing Isi-Uzo constituency, Mrs. Amaka Ugwueze as chairman.\n\nThe Hon. Ugwueze-led Joint Committee has fixed Tuesday, August 31 for public hearing on the bill.\n\nSpeaking to Sunday Sun on the deadline, the House Leader, Hon. Ezeugwu assured the people of the state that the House would meet up with all that is necessary for the bill to be passed into law, saying, \u201cwe are working on it and we will meet up with the deadline.\u201d\n\nHowever, an Enugu-based lawyer and rights activist, Olu Omotayo, frowned at the lack of willpower being shown by southern governors on the matter, noting that enacting the said law should not take more than one month.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom my own perspective, the governors have just been using that issue of open grazing as political gimmick. When you are talking of security that is the basis of any democracy. If security is lacking, you cannot be talking of democracy. Every other right starts from that; fundamental rights guaranteed in a democracy setting, stand on this issue of protection of lives and property. There is no way democracy can flourish without protection of lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the southern governors are just making political statements over a serious matter. Even before their statement, the states have attorney generals, who should have advised them that before you prohibit something there must be a law against it. There is no need for public ceremony. If they are keen as they always say repeatedly, I don\u2019t think to make such laws should even take more than one month, given the seriousness of the attacks we are seeing.\n\n\u201cBecause without that law, you cannot criminalize open grazing, so the law is very important to be made by the respective states in the Southern region. So without making the law you have not taken any step further.\n\n\u201cEnugu used to be the capital of the then Eastern region. Any decision taken here will have impact across the old region. So, it is important for the people in authority to make sure they live up to expectations of the people in the Southeast.\u201d\n\nEdo\n\nWith just two days to the S\u200eeptember 1, Edo State is yet to comply with the directive, checks by our correspondent have revealed.\n\nIt was learnt that Governor Godwin Obaseki was yet to forward an Executive Bill to the House of Assembly on the issue for consideration by the House.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Marcus Onobun, who confirmed that he was yet to receive the bill, said that he would crosscheck with the Clerk of the House to ascertain if the bill had been forwarded.\n\n\u201cPlease, let me find out from the\u200e Clerk of the assembly\u201d, he said. He, however, declined to pick repeated calls made to his mobile phone afterwards.\n\nOyo\n\nOn Thursday October 24, 2019, the Oyo State House of Assembly passed the Anti-Open Grazing Bill into law with a view to fostering peace, promote agricultural business in the state, avoid continuous damage to farmlands, and end loss of lives and unquantifiable investments to constant clashes between herders and crop farmers.\n\nThe Speaker of the Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, said that all suggestions and Memoranda of Understanding submitted by various groups, agencies and representatives of different communities and tribes at the public hearing on the open rearing and grazing regulation bill 2019 was painstakingly looked into before it was passed into law.\n\nThe bill was thereafter signed into law by Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nHowever, the law recommends establishment of a task force to be named, \u2018Open Grazing Prohibition Task Force\u2019, which will see to the implementation of the law, and would comprise representatives of the state government, security agencies, farmers\u2019 association, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, vigilante and the judiciary.\n\nThe governors of the Southwest of Nigeria had in January 2021 unanimously announced their decision to ban open grazing of cattle in the region, owing to the tension between herders and their host communities.\n\nThis was followed by the Lagos declaration by governors of the southern region that also set September 1, deadline for all states in the southern part of the country to have anti-open grazing laws in place.\n\nAkwa Ibom\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, the governor\u2019s executive bill on anti-open grazing was still awaited as at Friday. The Chairman of the state House of Assembly Committee on Information, Mr Aniefiok Dennis told our correspondent that information at his disposal had it that an executive bill through the state attorney general would be sent to the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment we have one that was sponsored by the member representing Mkpat Enin State Constituency, Bar Victor Ekwere. It has passed through first reading. But we have information that the governor is about to send in an executive bill. If they come with that one we will just marry the two and do the needful. But if they don\u2019t come, we have to continue with the one we have.\n\n\u201c I think we still have time and we can suspend every other thing and go ahead with it and have a public hearing so that members of the public would come and make input.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at doing something about it next week. Though we have the bill, we would like to have the executive bill and marry the two because the Southern governors appear to have had a template of the law.\u201d Dennis explained.\n\nWhen contacted, the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Uko Udom, simply said; \u201cThe process is ongoing\u201d.\n\nLagos\n\nBarely three days to the deadline, which Southern governors set for their states to pass laws against open grazing, investigations have shown that Lagos State is not bothered about the \u2018September 1\u2019 deadline as the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had not yet transmitted an Executive Bill on the matter, to the state assembly.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, a credible source within the Lagos State government said that going by the body language of the governor, he would not join in the bandwagon of southern states enacting laws against open grazing.\n\nEkiti\n\nThe Majority Leader, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Olugboyega Aribisogan, said: \u201cThe law was enacted in 2017 in Ekiti State and it has remained in force ever since. At the commencement of the operation of that law, the state government set up a task force which they codenamed Anti Grazing Task force for Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cThis Task force has been monitoring and enforcing all the clauses in the law making sure that there are no violation of that particular law and in the cause of their operation, violators have been arrested and prosecuted in the court of law, some have been fined, some have been sent to jail and some cattle were confiscated by the government of Ekiti State.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.\n\n\u201cThis has practically reduced the incident of farmers-herders\u2019 clashes in Ekiti in the last three years and we have been able to proliferate this particular law into some other South western states and even the one being operated by other South western states was taken from Ekiti State and we have in the last three years been operating that law without so many problems. Up till I am speaking to you there are cases of violators that are still pending in court.\u201d",

We are going into warfare and we must go to a warfare united, you cannot win if you are divided. So, let\u2019s not lose hope. We must remain focus with our eyes on the ball.\n\nAnd we shall, by the grace of God, score that goal.\u201d Earlier, the acting National Chairman of the PDP, Yemi Akinwonmi, speaking at the opening session of the NEC meeting, said that efforts to resolve the crisis in the opposition party are yielding fruits. The PDP has recently been embroiled in crisis as its leaders battle for supremacy ahead of the party\u2019s national convention to elect a new leadership. The crisis assumed a new twist last Monday after a Rivers State High Court, in Degema, restrained its National Chairman, Uche Secondus, from functioning as the lead- er of the opposition party. However, on Thursday, a Kebbi State High Court, in Birnin Kebbi, issued an order asking Secondus to resume his functions as national chairman. In another twist, a Federal High Court in Calabar, Cross River State, on Friday, restrained the PDP chairman from presiding over yesterday\u2019s NEC meeting. However, Akinwonmi, who explained that the NEC meeting was convened to take critical decision relating to the convention, urged party leaders not to allow anyone divide their ranks. Similarly, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, commended those involved in the various efforts to resolve the crisis rocking the PDP. Atiku noted that \u201cif you look at PDP, it has the most experienced people in this country, whether in the executive wing, whether in the legislature, whether in party administration, we have the most experience and most competent individuals in this party. \u201cTherefore, PDP in internal crisis management is far more efficient and far more better than APC and the APC government itself\u2026 and Nigerians should no longer be in doubt, of our sense of patriotism, and our sense of commitment to get this country moving again. \u201c Meanwhile, the PDP has said its national convention scheduled for October 30-31, will hold in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, disclosed this, yesterday, while briefing journalists on the outcome of the 92nd meeting National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party. Ologbondiyan said that the NEC will meet again on September 9 to approve nominations into the convention planning committee, as well as the committee on zoning.",

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nBeautiful plus-size actress-cum-social media influencer, Mary John, has opened up on her sojourn in Nollywood, her love life, unique selling points and other issues. Enjoy it.\n\nHow would you describe yourself and personality?\n\nI am a strong and determined woman. I also see myself as a go-getter. Mary is fun-loving and easy going lady.\n\nHow long have you been acting and how has it been?\n\nI\u2019ve been acting professionally for six years now, but I have been on and off. This is because of my other activities and businesses. To be honest, in 2018, I became pregnant so I had to stop filming for two years.\n\nHow\u2019s the baby doing?\n\nHe is doing very well. Thanks. He clocked three a few months ago.\n\nSo, how has it been generally? What are some of the challenges you\u2019ve been facing in the industry?\n\nComing to the industry isn\u2019t easy at all; you have to put in some extra work. To me, I am not all about the everyday movies. If I have two good movies a month that\u2019s okay for me. However, I am okay and doing fine. There is no challenge that I can\u2019t handle.\n\nYou took a break to have your baby, when you returned did you feel you missed out on some things?\n\nYes, I felt it, but seeing my baby\u2019s smiles, I felt he is also worth the break. My baby\u2019s smiles worth everything and more\u2026\n\nHow does your husband react seeing you play romantic roles in movies?\n\nPlease skip this. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nAs a plus size TV star, what are the issues you encounter on and off set?\n\nFor the kind of body I have, men were all over me. But due to my determination and drive, I didn\u2019t give them the opportunity. I knew what I wanted, so I just waived off all the temptations that came my way. Many were coming for the body not because they were in love with me, but as an experienced woman, I know what I wanted and I stood my ground.\n\nHave you had any embarrassing encounter lately?\n\nAh! A lot, but the recent one was this fateful day that I was walking on the road and people started taking pictures of my butt, shouting that it was too big. It was funny and embarrassing at the same time, but we move on.\n\nWhat were your parents\u2019 reactions when you opted to join Nollywood?\n\nAt first, my dad wasn\u2019t in support, but when my movies began to show on Africa Magic he became a fan.\n\nWhat are the main difficulties people of plus size encounter?\n\nI can\u2019t speak for anyone else because people face their own challenges. For me, none because I carry myself with so much pride. I\u2019m me and I will never want to be anyone else.\n\nIf given a chance, would you like to go under the knife for your body?\n\nYes oh. Just to remove belly fat, no additions to or subtractions from any other part of my body.\n\nLooking back, what are your regrets?\n\nThe only regret is that I got involved in a business that almost got me into depression.\n\nCan you mention titles of movies you\u2019ve done recently?\n\nAdaku is out, Perfect Game is a series and it\u2019s coming out soon. Perfect Marriage is coming out soon too. It was nominated for BON Awards. My other jobs aren\u2019t out yet.\n\nWhat would you say is your unique selling point?\n\nMy eyes, but most people will say \u2018Mary is a liar, it is her bumbum. However, I\u2019ll always choose my eyes and voice any time.\n\nWhat turns you on or off in relationship?\n\nMy turn on will be a responsible, caring, God-fearing man, who allows his woman to be herself at all times. A man who understands the word \u2018respect\u2019. My turn off will be an uptight man who thinks he owns the world. A man who does not understand that a woman too can be busy. Some men are so insecure that when she doesn\u2019t take his calls, she feels she\u2019s with another man. That is a big turn off for me.\n\nWhat kind of movie would you reject even if the pay is enticing?\n\nTo go completely nude is a no, no for me.\n\nBut you can play romantic roles?\n\nYes, but it shouldn\u2019t be too deep.\n\nWho is your celebrity crush?\n\nWill Smith. I love him. But in Nollywood, it\u2019s Jim Iyke, I so much love that guy. His gangster game should be studied in Harvard.\n\nWho are those stars you\u2019re looking forward to act alongside?\n\nIn Nollywood, Funke Akindele because she\u2019s a strong woman with a funny character. She is a wife, producer, director and a business mogul. I respect her so much. Also, Mercy Johnson and Genevieve Nnaji. And for mothers, I like and respect Joke Sylvia and Ebelle Okaro because they are really strong women.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do?\n\nI am a plus size model, an interior decorator and social media influencer. I am also into real estate, and always open to business collaborations.\n\nCan you tell us briefly about your educational background?\n\nMy educational story is very deep. My mates wrote JAMB once, but mine was four times. Well, it\u2019s not because I was not brilliant, but I didn\u2019t know the forces behind me not passing. However, the last time I wrote JAMB, I got admission into a private polytechnic and I studied Performing and Media Art.

          "text": "*Insists his tenure ends December\n\n*Party crisis deepens as another court sacks national chairman\n\n*NEC meets September 9 for approval of zoning of offices, convention committees\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe 92nd National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) took place yesterday in the absence of the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus.\n\nSecondus last night insisted that his four-year tenure would end in December.\n\nNEC, however, asked the six-man committee headed by the former Senate President, Senator David Mark to meet with stakeholders to resolve the matter.\n\nIt also adopted October 31 as the date of the national convention scheduled in Abuja, as recommended by the 40th meeting of the National Caucus of the party held on Friday.\n\nThe NEC also resolved to meet again on September 9 to adopt recommendations for the zoning of offices for the convention.\n\nBefore the meeting, Secondus in a deft political move, asked the Deputy National Chairman (South), Mr. Yemi Akinwomi, to preside over the NEC meeting of the party in his stead.\n\nSecondus, however, clarified last night that he has not resigned from his position but was only obeying court order.\n\nHe had been fighting for survival as the party\u2019s chairman.\n\nA Rivers State High Court had restrained Secondus from parading himself as the National Chairman of the party.\n\nBarely 24 hours later, a Kebbi State High Court reinstated him as the chairman of the party.\n\nBut few hours after returning to his desk, a Cross River High Court stopped him from parading himself as the National Chairman of the party and also restrained him from presiding over the NEC meeting that took place yesterday.\n\nSecondus in a letter to Akinwomi, said: \u201cI hereby request you to preside over the National Executive Committee meeting of the party, taking place today, 28th August, 2021@ noon, in my absence.\u201d\n\nThe interim order from a Cross River High Court was issued by Justice Edem Kufre, on Friday upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani, ahead of the PDP NEC.\n\nSecondus had obtained a Kebbi High Court order to return to his desk as national chairman last Thursday following an earlier injunction obtained against him from a Rivers State High Court.\n\nBriefing journalists after yesterday\u2019s NEC meeting, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said, \u201cNEC has resolved that Abuja will be the venue of the PDP National Elective Convention slated for October 31, 2021.\n\n\u201cNEC is to meet on the 9th of September to approve the various nominations into the respective national convention committees,\u201d the spokesman of the PDP said.\n\nAccording to the PDP spokesperson, \u201cNEC emphasised the indivisibility of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and stressed the need to remain united as a party as we work assiduously towards removing the inept, indolent and corrupt APC from government, come 2023.\u201d\n\nOlogbondiyan said that the NEC meeting of September 9 will come up with recommendations on zoning and composition of the various convention committees.\n\nHe said that NEC urged members to continue to make personal sacrifices in the overall interest of the party while commending the PDP governors\u2019 effort in inaugurating landmark projects in all states of the federation where the party has been handed over the responsibility of government.\n\nAccording to Ologbondiyan, the NEC urged Nigerians to take a cue from the deliverables in the respective states as a sign of the improvements that the party wishes to deliver when elected in 2023.\n\nHe said the party boasts of more experienced hands in party politics as well as governance, saying that its internal crisis management mechanism is far better than the operations of the APC as a party and even as government.\n\nHe added that NEC commended all party members for their various involvements in resolving issues that have recently occurred in the party and expressed confidence that the PDP has earned the trust of Nigerians once again and that the party will do better when allowed to lead the nation.\n\nAlso, he said that NEC condemned the media gagging and the attempt by the APC and President Buhari\u2019s government to promote obnoxious laws against the freedom of speech as well as media practice in Nigeria.\n\nNEC, he said, condemned the harassment and intimidation of media outfits in a desperate ploy by the APC to stifle free speech.\n\nSpeaking at the opening session of the NEC meeting, the chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal commended members of the party for their support.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs your ambassadors, we thank every one of you, our leaders, and our members across the country, for your support for your prayers, for all of the successes we have recorded in our state. Of course, you know, whenever I hear of any major event activity, or commissioning a project is happening only in PDP states, we shall continue to do our best. And we assure you of our total loyalty to our party.\n\n\u201cConcerning the issues of the moment, challenges, disputes, and disagreements are part of life, and indeed, politics. But what is important is how they are resolved. We have activated all mechanisms that we have in PDP, to resolve all of our issues. And as the chairman of PDP said, I concur.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to hold together, remain together because we are the hope of the people of Nigeria and Nigerians are looking forward to PDP and we cannot afford to fail them.\n\n\u201cThe challenges are quite many and we need to continue to work together as a family. We are going into warfare and we must go to a warfare united, you cannot win if you are divided. So let\u2019s not lose hope. We must remain focus with our eyes on the ball. And we shall, by the grace of God, score that goal,\u201d Tambuwal explained.\n\nAlso, the Senate Minority Leader Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, said: \u201cI want to assure you that as members of the National Assembly, we are with our party. The chairman and Deputy Chairman have this morning made statements to show that there is no crack in PDP.\n\n\u201cAs we were coming yesterday, I think we\u2019ve seen from the news that there were alternate chairman, deputies, and all that. But today, I think it\u2019s clear to everyone that PDP is one and we\u2019re moving forward. I want to thank our chairman of the governor\u2019s forum for assuring us that PDP will take over the government in 2023. Nigerians are looking for us.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired of that party that doesn\u2019t even have a board of trustees, not to talk of any other organ of the party. Nigeria\u2019s are tired of the party that is looking for a word to gag you the press, in an interview that was done that showed clearly how things are going bad in this country, and people are being summoned to answer queries at the NBC, which has never happened in this country. And so PDP is coming, Nigerians wait for PDP, and in 2023 give us your votes and will we deliver you back to where we came from.\n\nAlso, the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar in his speech said, \u201cIf you look at PDP, it has the most experienced people in this country, whether in the executive wing, whether in the legislature, whether, in party administration, we have the most experienced and most competent individuals in this party.\n\n\u201cTherefore, PDP in internal crisis management is far far more efficient and far better than APC and the APC government itself. So, I want to use this opportunity to commend and thank everybody who has been involved in trying to resolve the recent crisis. And Nigerians should no longer be in doubt, of our sense of patriotism, and our sense of commitment to get this country moving again.\n\n\u201cWe are being taken aback by the APC government and we have shown to Nigerians that, when we are trusted again, we will do even much better than we had done before,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nI Have Not Resigned, Says Embattled PDP Chairman\n\nMeanwhile, Secondus last night debunked rumours making the rounds that he had resigned from his position.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Ike Abonyi, the embattled PDP national chairman said it was not true that he has resigned but was obeying the interim order by the Cross State High Court sitting in Calabar.\n\nHe added that as a law-abiding citizen who has been an adherent of rule of law as a basis for democracy, he had to stay away in respect for the courts.\n\n\u201cMedia office of Prince Uche Secondus wishes to correct erroneous news circulating that he has stepped down as the National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus by his unavoidable absence at the party\u2019s NEC meeting on Saturday was merely obeying an interim order from Cross River State High Court.\n\n\u201cAs a law abiding citizen who has been an adherent of rule of law as a basis for democracy stayed away in respect for the courts.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus\u2019 four-year mandate to lead the party given on December 10, 2017 ends by December, 2021.\n\n\u201cBy this release, the media office wishes to urge media houses and members of the public, particularly beloved members of PDP, to disregard any news suggesting that he has stepped down,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*South Africa\u2019s GDP now $370bn, Nigeria\u2019s $432bn\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi\n\nNigeria has maintained her position as Africa\u2019s biggest economy after South Africa released the report of its rebased Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that pushed the latter\u2019s economy up by 11 per cent, an analysis of a new report by Statistics South Africa (SSA), has revealed.\n\nAfter a comprehensive overhaul of its national accounts up to the end of the 2020 fiscal year, South Africa disclosed in the SSA that the value of her economy increased to $370 billion as a result of the rebasing exercise.\n\nThe rebasing of South Africa\u2019s GDP coincided with the release of Nigeria\u2019s latest GDP report, which showed a 5.01 per cent growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nDuring the period under review, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the World Bank put Nigeria\u2019s GDP at $432.29 billion, indicating that her economy was $62.29 billion bigger than South Africa\u2019s after the latter rebased its GDP.\n\nIn a summary report obtained from its official website at the weekend, South Africa\u2019s statistics agency said the latest GDP rebasing and benchmarking exercise had resulted in an upward revision in the size of the economy, as well as changes to the composition of the supply and demand sides of economic activity.\n\nSpecifically, SSA\u2019s rebasing report showed that the rebased GDP \u201cis 11 per cent larger in 2020 than previously estimated. Between 2011 and 2020, the percentage difference between the previous and revised levels averaged 9.6 per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe percentage difference ranged between 8.6 per cent in 2014 to 11 per cent in 2020. The time series was revised from 1993. Differences between previous and revised levels are a typical outcome of rebasing and benchmarking exercises,\u201d SSA revealed in its latest report released midweek.\n\nComparatively, the report said the average increase between previous and revised GDP estimates across OECD countries was 3.8 per cent in 2010, ranging from 0.2 per cent for Luxembourg to 7.8 per cent for South Korea.\n\nIt added: \u201cLatin America recorded an average increase of 8.8 per cent and closer to home; Botswana revised the size of its economy down by 10 percent. How does South Africa\u2019s revised GDP affect its standing in Africa?\n\n\u201cIn terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), the World Bank currently ranks South Africa as the third biggest economy on the continent after Egypt and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEgypt\u2019s GDP (PPP$ in current prices) was PPP$1,290 billion, according to the World Bank\u2019s estimate, higher than that of Nigeria (PPP$1,069 billion) and South Africa (PPP$717 billion),\u201d the report said.\n\nDespite the 11 per cent increase recorded after rebasing, Africa\u2019s most advanced economy still lags behind Nigeria, which is at N154.25 trillion or $432.29 billion in 2020 as shown in the data of the NBS and World Bank.\n\nThe rebasing of South Africa\u2019s GDP coincided with the release of Nigeria\u2019s latest GDP report, which showed a 5.01 per cent growth in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe latest growth, according to the NBS in its new report, makes three consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\nIn the report, the NBS said: \u201cThe Q2, 2021 growth rate was higher than the -6.10 percent growth rate recorded in Q2 2020 and the 0.51 per cent recorded in Q1, 2021 year on year, indicating the return of business and economic activity near levels seen before the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe steady recovery observed since the end of 2020, with the gradual return of commercial activity as well as local and international travel, accounted for the significant increase in growth performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 when nationwide restrictions took effect.\n\n\u201cYear to date, real GDP grew 2.70 per cent in 2021 compared to -2.18 per cent for the first half of 2020. Nevertheless, quarter on quarter, real GDP grew at -0.79 percent in Q2, 2021 compared to Q1, 2021, reflecting slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\n\u201cThe nominal GDP growth rate in Q2, 2021 was higher than -2.80 per cent growth recorded in the second quarter of 2020 when economic activities slowed sharply at the outset of the pandemic. The Q2, 2021 nominal growth rate was also higher than the 12.25 per cent growth recorded in Q1 2021. For better clarity, the Nigerian economy has been classified broadly into the oil and non-oil sectors.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development yesterday, the immediate past Director-General of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Muda Yusuf told THISDAY that the size of an economy \u201cmatters a lot.\u201d\n\nYusuf, an economist, and a leading private sector advocate, pointed out that the size of an economy \u201cindicates the inherent opportunities for investment, revenue, profit, job creation and the welfare of the people.\u201d\n\nHowever, the economist observed that the size of the economy \u201cis not an end in itself. Rather, it should be a means to an end. The quality of lives must be positively impacted.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, pointed out that economic inclusion \u201cis critical in ensuring an impactful economy. Nigeria and South Africa are the two biggest economies in Africa. Yet, the two economies are grappling with profound challenges around inequality, poverty, social discontent, and insecurity.\n\n\u201cAll of these are manifestations of the absence of inclusion and social dislocations. Only recently, the two countries witnessed looting and destruction on an unprecedented scale.\n\n\u201cAlthough the triggers were different, the events were reflections of the underlying social problems that existed in these two countries. The standard of living in many countries in Africa is far higher than what we have in the two leading economies of the continent.\u201d\n\nYusuf, therefore, challenged the governments of Nigeria and South Africa to design economic and social policies to fix these gaps, which according to him, would require a greater focus on investment in social infrastructures such as education, healthcare, and the environment.\n\nHe explained that high investment in social infrastructure \u201cimpacts significantly on people\u2019s welfare. Investment in economic infrastructure \u2013 roads, railways, or power \u2013 is critical as well. This would impact productivity, cost of production, inflation, and the general level of competitiveness of firms.\n\n\u201cThe macroeconomic management is also crucial to ensure that the economic fundamentals support investment and productivity. This should support low inflation, stable currency, and low-interest rates. The growth of small businesses is vital to the promotion of economic inclusion because of their number and spread across the country.\n\n\u201cAn investment-friendly policy, regulatory and institutional environment is imperative. Hostile regulatory and institutional environments undermine investors\u2019 confidence and impact negatively on the economy,\u201d Yusuf explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We wish to state that THISDAY at no time published the said story. Our lead story on Friday, August 27 was \u2018Buhari Elated as NNPC Breaks Jinx, Declares N287bn Profit, First in 44 Years\u2019.\n\n\u201cSadly, these merchants of fake news have chosen to leverage on the credibility and integrity of THISDAY to ply their trade,\u201d Bello stated.\n\nThe MD rejected the poor attempt by the individual(s) at impersonating the THISDAY brand and identity in pursuit of whatever agenda they may have, by seeking to disseminate fake news to members of the public as emanating from the newspaper.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the statement noted that readers can easily verify the paper\u2019s Friday publication from the print edition, or online (www.thisdaylive.com).\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on members of the public who may have unwittingly fallen for the cloned digital copy to disregard it and treat it with the utmost contempt it deserves.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call on security agencies to help unmask the counterfeiters behind this forgery and bring them to book,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, Imo State Governor, Uzodimma, has also disowned the purported report on the cloned publication.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser to Governor, Mr. Oguwike Nwachuku, the Imo State governor described the publication as the work of desperate elements who wanted to tarnish his reputation and also destroy THISDAY as a brand\n\n\u201cThe originators of the fake publication have two things in mind: To tarnish the image of the governor and to destroy the credibility of THISDAY as a brand.\n\n\u201cThe ill-conceived publication shows how desperate individuals and groups can get in trying to destroy the society, thinking that Governor Uzodimma is the issue.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the real headline of THISDAY the same Friday, August 27 reads: \u2018Buhari Elated as NNPC Breaks Jinx, Declares N287bn Profit First In 44 Years\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that THISDAY management confirmed that the publication was cloned and we are confident that they will not allow their hard-earned brand and efforts of many years to be bastardised by criminal-minded fellows.\n\n\u201cGovernor Uzodimma is conscious of the efforts being made by some individuals and groups to tarnish his image and discredit his government but will not be deterred in his determination to provide good governance to the good people of Imo State,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement advised the public to disregard the cloned publication as coming from depraved minds and enemies of the people and the society.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) expended N541.65 billion subsidy on petrol between February and July this year, a document detailing the national oil company\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for August 2021, has shown.\n\nThe document obtained by THISDAY showed that N25.374 billion was spent on what the corporation terms under-recovery or value shortfall in February, it was N60.39 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April.\n\nIt more than doubled to N126.298 billion in May, markedly reduced to N164.337 billion in June, and further came down to N103.286 billion in July.\n\nAs a consequence of the payment, the NNPC has been largely unable to fully remit its \u2018calendared projected monthly contribution of N209 billion to the joint account since February, with the worst case being in April when it remitted zero amount to FAAC.\n\nOn Friday, THISDAY reported that the corporation was again set to deduct about N215.3 billion from its contribution to next month\u2019s joint federation account, being a combination of N175 billion subsidy sum and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data showed that NNPC paid N67.280 billion to the joint account in July, an improvement on the N47.162 billion in June, with the succeeding month\u2019s payment being about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, the net revenue to FAAC by the NNPC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June, and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nYear-to-date, the document showed that the NNPC had only been able to make a contribution of N349.254 billion to the three tiers of government with a huge deficit of N1.115 trillion.\n\nIn all, in July, as released on August, 16 local and international oil trading companies had dealings with the NNPC under the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase arrangement in 28 transactions in the month.\n\nNNPC\u2019s profit was N67.2 billion, with contributions from JV crude being N1.632 billion, domiciled crude being N31.73 billion, while miscellaneous income and domiciled gas were N27.11 billion and N6.795 billion respectively.\n\nIn terms of federal government priority projects, national domestic gas development gulped N2.52 billion during the month, gas infrastructure development cost N2.977 billion, and the Brass LNG gas supply project did not get any funding.\n\nIn addition, frontier exploration services gulped N2.975 billion, renewables consumed N885 million, total spending on pipeline security and maintenance was N7.352 billion, and refinery rehabilitation, the main payment for salaries and utilities, was N8.33 billion. Furthermore, N83 million was spent on the Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nOf all the cost centres during the month, only under-recovery and pipelines security were fully funded, leaving other projects like domestic gas financing, for instance, under-funded to the tune of N24.3 billion, gas infrastructure with a deficit of N17.853 billion, and frontier exploration by N14.652 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, N1.304 trillion has been deducted for recurrent and capital expenditures by the NNPC, according to the document, while total distribution plus miscellaneous hit N1.653 trillion in July. However, a deficit of N1.250 trillion remained hanging.\n\nVandalism of NNPC infrastructure continued as a breakdown of the pipeline and management cost of N3.659 billion indicated that N2.708 billion was for security maintenance, pipelines, and facilities repairs were N392.950 million, while the NNPC\u2019s strategic holding was N577.410 million.\n\nThe status of the NNPC\u2019s payment to its Joint Venture cash call arrears obligation has remained unchanged since May at $3.22 billion out of a total negotiated sum of $4.689 billion since 2016. The outstanding balance remained $1.464 billion since May this year.\n\nBut added to JV cost recovery and priority projects, the document revealed that the total distribution, made by the corporation in January was N195.624 billion, it was N191.194 billion in February and hit N224.589 billion in March.\n\nIn addition, it was to N156.366 in April, but again hit a high of N320.315 in May and was N295.396 and N270.405 billion in June and July respectively.\n\nIn June the corporation had continued its regime of deductions from the federation account withholding N117.4 billion from the three tiers of government.\n\nTwo months ago, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres and worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nThe national oil company stated that the under-recovery or subsidy that the government pays on the product every month had begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThis, it said was making the corporation unable to contribute fully to the national coffers, the federation account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the gains made from rising international oil prices.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, had also explained that with the exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre in June, maintaining that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nA THISDAY check-in July showed that the NNPC\u2019s payment to the federation account had declined by over 63 per cent in the first five months of 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Retributive violence is not the answer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile these troubled communities are being reinforced with security personnel, our religious, traditional and other community leaders must not allow the use of their spaces for the propagation of violence and incitement to violence.\n\n\u201cAttempts to simplify the reasons into a basic narrative may help raise donor-dollars for international NGOs, fill pages of overseas newspapers, and burnish foreign politicians\u2019 faith credentials; but this does not increase understanding, nor offer solutions.

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

It is our collective responsibility to take care of children whose parents cannot provide for their daily feeding.\u201d\n\nHe further called for an extension of school hours for children in primary schools across the state, noting that it will improve the gains recorded by the Edo Basic Education Section Transformation (EdoBEST) in the last three years.\n\nObaseki stated that extending the school closing time by one hour will increase the teacher-pupil contact, give the pupils more time to learn and cover the school curriculum, noting, \u201cThe extension of school closing time by one more hour will give the children more time for learning and to cover the school curriculum especially as the COVID-19 pandemic had made us lose so much time in the last one year.\u201d\n\nHe said through the deployment of technology, the state government has been able to monitor progress made by over 270,000 children in public schools across the state, adding that his administration will leverage on the use of ICT to strengthen the Ministry of Education with the support of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) to track and monitor the development and learning process of children irrespective of the school they attend.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith the introduction of EdoBEST, we have changed the culture of our classroom by simplifying the curriculum to make learning fun and easy through the deployment of technology. The change was made possible through the support of Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), teachers and parents.\n\n\u201cWe have succeeded because we have decided to gather our limited resources to improve infrastructure in our schools. We have built more than 204 classrooms while renovating over 9,000 others, as it is now comfortable for our children.

When the vaccines came to Nigeria, I signified interest in taking the vaccine, I took it along with my wife, and nothing has happened to me or my wife. I have continued to encourage my friends to come out and get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nIze-Iyamu continued: \u201cI urge Edo citizens to seize the opportunity created by the Edo State Government and get vaccinated. This is the time to take it when there is no rush because a time is coming when we will beg and fight for it.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to the government for making it available and encouraging us to take it. I encourage you all to go and take it; the vaccine is good and safe.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Parish Priest of St. Peter Catholic Church Ugbor, Very Rev. Fr. Stephen Okojie, noted: \u201cWe are happy that we have vaccines now to defeat this pandemic; the rumour about the vaccines is not true. We took vaccines while growing up, there is no issue with vaccination against the COVID-19 pandemic. I am fully vaccinated; I have taken my two doses and we have over 60 percent of parishioners here already vaccinated. We have been preaching about it and encouraging our people to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate what the governor is doing and the level of acceptance by the people. Preachers should stop discouraging people from being vaccinated; if they don\u2019t want to be vaccinated they should allow their people who want to be vaccinated to do so.\n\nOn her part, Uabor applauded the Christian faithful for accepting the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe acceptance rate by Christians across churches visited today is tremendous and encouraging. People are coming out to take the vaccines. We have enough doses in the State for the people.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s leading commercial bank, Zenith Bank Plc, in a demonstration of resilience, has announced its audited results for the half-year ended 30 June 2021, recording positive growth across key financial metrics despite a challenging macroeconomic environment exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited half-year financial results presented to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), the Group recorded a growth in profit before tax of 3% from NGN114 billion reported in H1 2020 to NGN117 billion in H1 2021. The Group also recorded a 9% growth in non-interest income from NGN116 billion in June 2020 to NGN127 billion in June 2021. Overall, the significant reduction in interest expense by 26% and growth in non-interest income by 9% culminated in improved profitability.\n\nThe Group\u2019s retail journey continues to deliver positive results as retail deposits grew by NGN38.2 billion from NGN1.72 trillion to NGN1.76 trillion year-to-date (YTD). Savings balances grew marginally by 2% YTD to close at NGN1.18 trillion from NGN1.16 trillion as at December 2020. The drive for increased retail deposits and a low-interest yield environment helped reduce the cost of funding from 2.2% to 1.3% in the current period. Operating expenses grew by 10% YoY, but growth remains below the inflation rate, while the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew 2% from NGN3.30 to NGN3.38 for the half-year ended June 2021.\n\nThe Group also increased total customer deposits by 8% to close the period at NGN5.77 trillion, demonstrating growth in the market share. Total assets grew marginally to NGN8.52 trillion as at 30 June 2021 from NGN8.48 trillion recorded as at 31 December 2020. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic induced challenges and the challenging operating environment, the Group grew its risk assets as gross loans were up by 3% YTD, from NGN2.92 trillion to NGN2.99 trillion. This was conservatively achieved at a low Non-Performance Loans (NPL) ratio of 4.51% (FYE 2020: 4.29%) and a reduced cost of risk of 1.3% (June 2020: 1.8%). Prudential ratios such as liquidity and capital adequacy also remained above regulatory thresholds at 69.9% and 22.0%, respectively.\n\nDespite the continued prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is cautious optimism that the global economy will continue to recover as vaccination programmes are intensified. On the domestic economy, Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01% in the second quarter of 2021, and the inflation rate, which peaked in March 2021 at 18.17%, is gradually trending down (currently at 17.38% as at July 2021). The Group is well-positioned to maximise the opportunities that these recovering fundamentals present while leveraging technology to expand its retail footprints to deliver improved returns to all its stakeholders.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. Also, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, and Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine. The bank was also recognised as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020, Retail Bank of the year at the 2020 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards, and Best Company in Promotion of Good Health and Well-Being as well as Best Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment at the Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2020.\n\nZenith Bank has grown enormously in 30 years to become Nigeria\u2019s largest and one of Africa\u2019s largest financial institutions by tier-1 capital, with shareholders\u2019 funds of NGN1.1 trillion ($2.64 billion) as at 31st December 2020. The Bank continues to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. Zenith Bank is the clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in the deployment of innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) spent N541.65 billion subsidy on fuel subsidy between February and July this year.\n\nThis is according to a document detailing the national oil company\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for August 2021.\n\nThe document showed that N25.374 billion was spent on what the corporation terms under-recovery or value shortfall in February, it was N60.39 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April, ThisDay reported.\n\nIt more than doubled to N126.298 billion in May, markedly reduced to N164.337 billion in June, and further came down to N103.286 billion in July.\n\nAs a consequence of the payment, the NNPC has been largely unable to fully remit its \u2018calendared projected monthly contribution of N209 billion to the joint account since February, with the worst case being in April when it remitted zero amount to FAAC.\n\nThe corporation is also set to deduct about N215.3 billion from its contribution to next month\u2019s joint federation account, being a combination of N175 billion subsidy sum and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data showed that NNPC paid N67.280 billion to the joint account in July, an improvement on the N47.162 billion in June, with the succeeding month\u2019s payment being about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, the net revenue to FAAC by the NNPC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June, and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nYear-to-date, the document showed that the NNPC had only been able to make a contribution of N349.254 billion to the three tiers of government with a huge deficit of N1.115 trillion.\n\nIn all, in July, as released on August, 16 local and international oil trading companies had dealings with the NNPC under the Direct-Sale-Direct-Purchase arrangement in 28 transactions in the month.\n\nNNPC\u2019s profit was N67.2 billion, with contributions from JV crude being N1.632 billion, domiciled crude being N31.73 billion, while miscellaneous income and domiciled gas were N27.11 billion and N6.795 billion respectively.\n\nIn terms of federal government priority projects, national domestic gas development gulped N2.52 billion during the month, gas infrastructure development cost N2.977 billion, and the Brass LNG gas supply project did not get any funding.\n\nIn addition, frontier exploration services gulped N2.975 billion, renewables consumed N885 million, total spending on pipeline security and maintenance was N7.352 billion, and refinery rehabilitation, the main payment for salaries and utilities, was N8.33 billion. Furthermore, N83 million was spent on the Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nOf all the cost centres during the month, only under-recovery and pipelines security were fully funded, leaving other projects like domestic gas financing, for instance, under-funded to the tune of N24.3 billion, gas infrastructure with a deficit of N17.853 billion, and frontier exploration by N14.652 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, N1.304 trillion has been deducted for recurrent and capital expenditures by the NNPC, according to the document, while total distribution plus miscellaneous hit N1.653 trillion in July. However, a deficit of N1.250 trillion remained hanging.\n\nVandalism of NNPC infrastructure continued as a breakdown of the pipeline and management cost of N3.659 billion indicated that N2.708 billion was for security maintenance, pipelines, and facilities repairs were N392.950 million, while the NNPC\u2019s strategic holding was N577.410 million.\n\nThe status of the NNPC\u2019s payment to its Joint Venture cash call arrears obligation has remained unchanged since May at $3.22 billion out of a total negotiated sum of $4.689 billion since 2016. The outstanding balance remained $1.464 billion since May this year.\n\nBut added to JV cost recovery and priority projects, the document revealed that the total distribution, made by the corporation in January was N195.624 billion, it was N191.194 billion in February and hit N224.589 billion in March.\n\nIn addition, it was to N156.366 in April, but again hit a high of N320.315 in May and was N295.396 and N270.405 billion in June and July respectively.\n\nIn June the corporation had continued its regime of deductions from the federation account withholding N117.4 billion from the three tiers of government.\n\nTwo months ago, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres and worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nThe national oil company stated that the under-recovery or subsidy that the government pays on the product every month had begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThis, it said was making the corporation unable to contribute fully to the national coffers, the federation account, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the gains made from rising international oil prices.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, had also explained that with the exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre in June, maintaining that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre, ThisDay reported.",

          "text": "Association of Shop Owners in Area 7 Abuja in a bid to protect the investments of its members has called on the FCT minister to intervene and revert the purported demolition of the area 7 UTC Shopping complex by Abuja Investment Company Limited under the guise of remodeling the complex.\n\nIn a joint meeting held with the Abuja Markets Management Limited, the association \u201cdemanded proof that the Abuja Investments Company Limited are the owners of the complex.\u201d Despite promises made by Abuja Markets Management Limited to get answers from its parent body, nothing has been heard of to date.\n\n\u201cWe have so much at stake in this enterprise and totally ignoring us as the Management is currently doing is tantamount to stretching our resilience beyond limits. It\u2019s on this premise we resolved to offer the following prayers to the Minister of FCT for his prompt intervention.\n\n\u201cWe pray that this very unusual plan by Management is rescinded for now especially at this trying time in the economic life of this nation. And that prompts us to ask the salient question; who owns Urban Shelter, and why is it being used as a veiled instrument to dispossess law-abiding citizens of their legitimate properties? We wish to state also that the complex was not built as a shopping mall; rather as a safe haven for the struggling masses especially retired civil servants to thrive in whatever business they choose to embark on.\n\n\u201cThe market; we that are there say is overbuilt as three other shopping malls and plazas are gradually turning the only road running through the complexes a motorists nightmare. Erecting a completely new structure in the vicinity would further worsen the already bad situation. It is hereby suggested that the complex and UTC Block be given a facelift, instead,\u201d a statement signed by its Chairman, Godfrey Ojarikre reads.\n\nThe association explained that If the remodeling must take place; all stakeholders must be accommodated as partners in progress on the negotiation table.\n\n\u201cThis presupposes that every Shop Owner would be offered the first right of refusal over any new allocation. Moreover; the modalities geared towards the full and successful implementation of any new project would be jointly addressed by all stakeholders.\n\nThe Association recalled that the Federal Capital Development Authority had in the year 1992, allocated spaces to the citizens of FCT, adding that in 1997, letters of reconfirmation of allocated spaces.\n\nIt also noted that the Abuja Investment Company Limited came into existence in 2008 and has taken several steps including sending letters of termination, most of which it said, it ignored because the Investment Company was not responsible for issuance in the first place.\n\n\u201cFurther to our earlier oral and written representation to the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council that was mandated by the Permanent Secretary to investigate the circumstances surrounding threats by the Abuja Investments Company Limited. to Remodel the Area 7 Shopping Complex / UTC, we hereby make our final submission as follows;\n\n\u201cIn the year 1992; the Federal Capital Development Authority allocated shops/space to Four Hundred and Seventy One citizens of the FCT majority of who were retired civil servants. In 1997 a letter of reconfirmation of allocation of shop/space was issued with directives to not only enter into a tenancy agreement with the FCT Market Management Committee, but convert the shop space to permanent structures in accordance with the approved prototype design which was attached and that the conversion would be supervised by authorized professionals. The allotment was duly supervised and the shops built by individuals with hard earned monies derived from loans, pensions and gratuities\n\n\u201cThe Abuja Investments Company Limited and the Abuja Markets Management Limited came into existence in 2008 and in line with the oppressive style of leadership in the affairs of the FCT then, a notice of termination of tenancy was issued on the 16th July 2008. We remained unperturbed over the notice because it was not from the Authority that allocated the shops to us in the first place,\u201d the statement added\n\nThis, the statement said, was followed by a Letter of Offer for a Five Year Lease on March 30th, 2009, and finally, a Letter of Offer for Tenancy was issued on 30th June 2013, six months short of the Five Year Lease agreement, which is still operational till date.\n\n\u201cWe wish to place on good authority that we constituted ourselves into an Association in early 2009 and we were duly registered by the Corporate Affairs Commission. Moreover; Management has over the years been addressing us by our registered name. All Shop Owners have been consistent in their payment of Ground Rent to the Abuja Investments Company Limited; and Service Charge to the Abuja Markets Management Limited from January; 2009 till date. And that lawfully confers on every Shop Owner the statutory right of ownership.\u201d",

          "text": "The United States said it destroyed an explosive-laden vehicle with an airstrike in Kabul on Sunday, hours after President Joe Biden warned of another terror attack in the capital as a massive airlift of tens of thousands of Afghans entered its last days.\n\nA Taliban spokesman confirmed the incident, saying a car bomb destined for the airport had been destroyed \u2014 and that a possible second strike had hit a nearby house.\n\nThe US said it had only struck the vehicle, but added that secondary blasts indicated \u201ca substantial amount of explosive material\u201d.\n\nLocal media reported possible civilian casualties, which the US said it was assessing.\n\nAnd with just two days to go until the agreed-upon date for US withdrawal, the Taliban revealed their supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada was in southern Afghanistan and planning to make a public appearance.\n\n\u201cHe is present in Kandahar. He has been living there from the very beginning,\u201d said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.\n\n\u201cHe will soon appear in public,\u201d added deputy spokesman Bilal Karimi of the leader, whose whereabouts have remained largely unknown and who has never made a public appearance.\n\nThe US airstrike came after a suicide bomber from the Islamic State group on Thursday targeted US troops stopping huge crowds of people from entering Kabul\u2019s airport. About 114,000 people have been evacuated since August 15, when the Taliban swept back into power.\n\nMore than 100 people died in the attack, including 13 US service personnel. Biden traveled Sunday to an air force base in Delaware to attend the somber ritual transfer of their remains.\n\nThe attack and terror threats have slowed the airlift ahead of Biden\u2019s deadline for evacuations to end by Tuesday.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that some 300 Americans still in Afghanistan were seeking to leave the country.\n\n\u201cThey are not going to be stuck in Afghanistan,\u201d National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on the Fox network, adding that the US had \u201ca mechanism to get them out\u201d.\n\nThe Pentagon said Saturday that retaliation drone strikes had killed two \u201chigh-level\u201d IS jihadists in eastern Afghanistan, but Biden warned of more imminent attacks from the group.\n\nThe US embassy in Kabul later released a warning of credible threats at specific areas of the airport, including access gates.\n\nIn recent years, the Islamic State\u2019s Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.\n\nThey have massacred civilians at mosques, public squares, schools, and even hospitals.\n\nWhile both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamists, they are bitter foes \u2014 with each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.\n\nUnthinkable Co-operation\n\nThe IS attack has forced the US military and the Taliban to co-operate in ensuring security at the airport in a way unthinkable just weeks ago.\n\nOn Saturday, Taliban fighters escorted a steady stream of Afghans from buses to the main passenger terminal, handing them over to US forces for evacuation.\n\nAfter a 20-year war, the foes were within clear sight of each other, separated by just 30 metres.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said US troops had started withdrawing \u2014 without saying how many were left.\n\n\u2018Heartbreaking\u2018\n\nWestern allies that helped with the airlift have mostly ended their evacuation flights. Some voiced despair at not being able to fly out everyone at risk.\n\nThe head of Britain\u2019s armed forces, General Sir Nick Carter, told the BBC it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d that \u201cwe haven\u2019t been able to bring everybody out\u201d.\n\nA White House official said 2,900 people were evacuated in a 24-hour period between Saturday and Sunday, a drastic reduction from earlier in the week.\n\nFrance and Britain will on Monday urge the United Nations to work for the creation of a \u201csafe zone\u201d in Kabul to protect humanitarian operations, French President Emmanuel Macron said.\n\nBut Macron said discussions with the Taliban about evacuations do not indicate France is recognizing the hardline group as the new rulers of Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban are the ones in control\u2026 we have to have these discussions from a practical point of view. This does not mean there will be recognition,\u201d Macron told TF1 television during a visit to Iraq, insisting the Taliban must meet \u201cconditions\u201d on humanitarian matters, especially women\u2019s rights.\n\nAnd on Sunday, approximately 100 countries announced in a joint statement they would continue processing documents for both Afghans and foreign nationals to leave the country even after the US withdrawal deadline of Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have received assurances from the Taliban\u201d that all those with the right travel documentation \u201cwill be allowed to proceed in a safe and orderly manner,\u201d the statement, released by the US State Department, said.\n\nAlso on Sunday US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he and foreign ministers from France, Germany, Britain, Turkey, NATO and other \u201ckey partners\u201d would meet virtually to discuss an \u201caligned approach\u201d on Afghanistan going forward.\n\nThe UN said it was bracing for a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d of up to half a million more refugees from Afghanistan by the end of 2021.",
