          "text": "By Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe National Pension Commission (Pencom) has said that the Federal Government has not borrowed money from any pension fund administrator in the country.\n\nThis, the Commission said, was to address complaints and rumours in some quarters that a large chunk of the government\u2019s recurrent spendings were done by borrowing from pension funds.\n\nPencom\u2019s Head of Corporate Services, Alhaji Abdulqadir Dahiru, gave the hint while speaking at a Stakeholders Forum/Interactive Session organised by the Public Complaint Commission with the theme: \u2018Effective Administration of the Contributory Pension Scheme in Nigeria: Challenges and the Way Forward\u2019.\n\nHe clarified that instead of the government to borrow pension funds, it was the investment teams of pension fund administrators that seek and put money into government bonds to balance their return and risk considerations.\n\nSome stakeholders at the forum had said, \u201cThe speculation that the Government is borrowing from the Pension fund is a threat to the contributors.\n\n\u201cThe safety of the Fund is paramount to contributors and other stakeholders alike.\n\n\u201cThere is need to ascertain the authenticity of the allegation of borrowing to possibly curb any threat to the Scheme.\u201d\n\nResponding, Dahiru stated: \u201cPension funds are invested in government securities like banks, insurance companies, and foreign investors who are interested in government debt.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has not borrowed pension funds, because people are giving the impression as if these monies are kept somewhere and government has dipped its hands into it.\n\n\u201cPension funds are invested. It is a deliberate policy of individual pension fund administrators and their investment teams to look at the investment instruments available, whether government or private, and decide which one they want to invest in, to balance their return and risk considerations.\n\n\u201cTherefore, government does not borrow pension funds. Instead, they are invested in government debt instruments.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Secretary, Public Complaint Commission, Mr Philip Enyali, explained that the dissatisfaction of many retirees and the need to address their many petitions to the Ombudsman, regarding their entitlements necessitated the interactive meeting with Stakeholders in the pension industry.\n\nHe identified the inability of the government to release funds as and when due, delay in payment of group life insurance policy, non-funding Retirement Savings Accounts, inadequacy of pension payment remittances etc. as some of the complaints by retirees to the ombudsman.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest challenges that stares the typical employees in the face throughout their working life is life after retirement. As part of proactive efforts by the Commission, this interactive session is being held to systematically examine the challenges of the administration of the Contributory Pension Scheme currently in operation in the country,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Abdulmumin Murtala, Kano\n\nThe Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADDITOPP) is calling on the Federal Government to create necessary concessions to its operations in order to reduce cost and provide petroleum products at a lesser retail rate.\n\nThe call was made by the Association\u2019s Consultant Dr Morris Ibe on Tuesday in Kano after a sensitization meeting of its members.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, Ibe explained that they were at Kano to push a united agenda for what benefits the members and provide the products at affordable rates.\n\nFollowing the recent conversion of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to a Limited liability by President Muhammadu Buhari, the association says it is necessary for the transporters to adapt to it particularly as regards their bridging claims and how to reduce expenses that goes around their business operation which will subsequently reduce the retail and pump price.\n\nSome of the issues they identified at the sensitization meeting include among others, how to procure hard currency from the Central Bank of Nigeria for maintenance and purchase of trucks as well as converting their trucks from using diesel, which is expensive, to using natural gas which is cheaper as it is locally made.\n\n\u201cThe issue of foreign currency comes about as we are exploring ways to reduce the cost of operation and others.\n\n\u201cThese trucks are acquired abroad, from Europe, Asia and America, that\u2019s where they buy their trucks. The tires and most of the maintenance products, the lubricants are bought abroad, non of these things are manufactured locally. So what we are trying to do to achieved that is seeing a way the Central Bank of Nigeria can give our members, even if is not concessionary rates on foreign currencies, but reasonable allocation of foreign currency to them to enable them buy, replace their trucks, replace truck parts, their tires, lubricants, without having to break their back and having to go to the black market to buy Dollars at outrageous prices. These affect the cost of their operations.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the issue of converting their trucks from using diesel to natural gas is also geared towards reducing the cost of operation.\n\n\u201cLike you heard, the cost of picking up a product from Lagos to Kano per truck is about N1.2 million. We are saying that from the analysis that is being presented to us, that if these trucks are converted to natural gas, instead of N1.2 million, you will be looking at about N200,000 to N300,000 per truck. So is worth looking at, is worth pushing further.\n\n\u201cWe also say that the government should come in and help our members in conversion of these trucks, which is about N10m per truck to convert it from using diesel to using natural gas. We have some of our members with a hundred, two hundred or even five hundred trucks and some times more.\n\n\u201cThat will be an outrageous amount of cost for a transporter to bear. So we are saying we need to approach the federal government to see how they can create a concession to that\u201d the Consultant of ADDITOPP stated.",

          "title": "Lagos-Ibadan Highway: Still a nightmare The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "The Lagos/Ibadan Expressway has become a major problem to the Federal Government. Successive administration\u2018s promised failed to deliver. Works ministers merely visited the highway and made promises they could not fulfill. May 29, last year was reportedly announced as the road\u2019s delivery date. But it never came to pass. Now residents on the axis are going through hell since the construction firm returned to site. OKWY IROEGBU-\u00adCHIKEZIE reports.\n\nThe Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is vital in many ways. It is the major route to the northern, southern and eastern parts of the country.\n\nThe oldest expressway in the country, it was inaugurated in August 1978, during the military era. Sadly, its expansion has been delayed over the years.\n\nOne thing constant occurence on the road is that as early as 4am daily, most commuters, who barely had a good night rest, are already on the road to avoid its perenial gridlock.\n\nDaily interruption of sleep, experts say, is not healthy for the body, but that is what commuters experience because of the twin problems of laxity on the part of the contractor and government which, from all indications, has lost control of supervising Julius Berger, the contractor handling the road.\n\nIt has become normal for the contractor to narrow the road anytime without putting a sign or notice to inform millions of commuters. Professionals say Julius Berger is supposed to develop the alternative roads by Mikano and Warewa, leading to the cattle market, to make for easy movement but nothing has been done.\n\nCommuters, who spoke to The Nation, wondered if the contractor could do this in its home country, Germany, and get away with it. They berated the Federal Government for allowing a foreign firm to punish her citizens against international best practice.\n\nThe 127.6-kilometre-long expressway connecting Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, and Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest city, observers say, has become synonymous with delays running into hours, lone and fatal accidents, fuel tankers tipping, fire outbreaks and craters on the road. Commuters also contend with highway robbers and petty thieves because the perennial traffic provides a cover for them.\n\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan kicked off the reconstruction of the expressway 10 years ago, but it was later abandoned. Even in its records, this must be the longest job for Julius Berger, which is losing its reputation as a giant in roadworks.\n\nThe Muhammadu Buhari-led government inherited the road in 2015, but could not complete it as promised, until its first term expired.The government is relying on the Sukkuk Fund and the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority fund (NSIA) to complete the road. Menwhile, motorits suffer such that travelling from Lagos to Ibadan has become nightmarish, with the attendant dangers to life and property. The construction has been described as one of the most-expensive in the world, with periodic variations by the contractors with government\u2019s nod.\n\nThe expressway has become a death trap for many, with long travelling hours experience for motorists and road users alike. We have heard of heart-rending stories of how a one-hour journey from Lagos to Ibadan turned to several hours of sufferings.\n\nThe gridlock on the expressway got worse penultimate Friday as travellers struggled to leave town for the holidays. From the Old Toll Gate to Magboro, Ogun State, was blocked and vehicular movements were at a standstill after impatient motorists and commercial drivers drove against traffic.\n\nOn Thursday, The Nation noted that the traffic on the expressway resurfaced after the resumption of construction at the Otedola/Secretariat end of the road. At OPIC and Kara cattle market of not more than 100 metres, motorists spend about an hour and half to scale through.The situation has been compounded by the heavy rainfall in the last few days, which affected some sections of the road; as vehicles slow down to avoid potholes.\n\nCommuters wondered why the government was not showing concern for the plight of the road users as there has been reported cases of head-on collision.\n\nA civil engineer, Afolabi Olatunde, berated the government for punishing the citizens through the contractor.\n\nHe said Julius Berger\u2019s action on the road was a sign of compromise by the supervising ministry as alternative routes, laybys, towing vehicles for broken down trucks and tankers were nonexistent. According to him, until there is a real cleansing in the public service, Nigeria is doomed.\n\nA motorist, Kazeem Adeoti, said he left Mowe at 4.20am to get to his office at Ajah but the traffic trapped him for four hours.\n\nA passenger from Arepo, Sadiat Salako, pleaded with the government to get the contractor to put all their might in the construction to alleviate their suffering. According to her, the stress commuters go through can lead to serious health implications. She advised fellow commuters to do checks to ascertain their health status.\n\nAnother motorist, Onwudiwe Innocent, who drove against traffic, said he took the decision because he \u201chad no other choice\u201d.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to stay for longer hours in the traffic. The traffic officials have no choice than to allow us to pass,\u201d he added.\n\nSome commuters, including children, on Tuesday at Arepo end of the expressway, heading towards Lagos, resorted to walking, as they could not find a bus to convey them.\n\nMeanwhile, the gridlock got hawkers excited, as they made brisk business as most of them sold out their products. Some of them had to deposit their phones with distributors of soft drinks, water and other snacks to have access to the products as a result of the high demand by commuters.\n\nA man hawking sausage, Uche Ndukwe, claimed he sold three cartons on Tuesday, adding that without traffic, he might still be struggling with a carton.\n\nEvery other day there are reports of robberies and accidents with lives lost as a result of craters and non-power supply on the road, still nothing concrete is done.\n\nResponding to inquiries by The Nation as to why the contractor was not working at night to speed up the construction of the road, a senior officer who pleaded anonymity, cited insecurity. He added that the government did not have money nor were provisions made on the contract to pay ransom for kidnapped workers.\n\n\u201cRight now, nobody is sure of anything except that the construction will last for six months but residents on that axis and commuters are wondering how they can tolerate this insensitive contractor and government for six months at the scale as there is a sense of urgency from them,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother common feature is that every other day, is that sometimes vehicles break down and take long hours or days to be towed off the road because the firm does not have a ready\u00adto\u00adgo towing vehicle which is embedded in the contract.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Fred Ezeh, Adanna Nnamani, Abuja, Bimbola Oyesola and Chinyere Anyanwu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has given the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, two weeks to resolve the impasse that led to the over five-month strike embarked up by Academic Staff Union of Universities, (ASUU), and three other university-based unions and report back to him.\n\nHe gave the directive after he received briefings from relevant government Ministries, Agencies and Departments involved in resolving the face-off with the university unions, yesterday.\n\nASUU had embarked on one-month warning strike on February 14, and was joined by the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), the Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) and the National Association of Academic Technologists, (NAAT) following inability of the government to meet their demands.\n\nYesterday\u2019s meeting summoned by President Buhari was to get briefing from government team on why the strike has lingered. Sources at the meeting said President Buhari directed that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige must be in all the meetings to resolve the crisis.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, (SGF), Boss Mustapha, sources say, was also mandated to be part of the team to interface with the striking unions.\n\nThose at the meeting were Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Ngige, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, the Head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folashade Yemi-Esan, the Chairman of National Salaries Income and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta, the Director-General Budget Office, Ben Akabueze.\n\nHowever, ASUU National President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, has said if government was sincere and seriously desiring an end to the strike, it should not take more than two days.\n\nHe said two weeks was too long since the issues involved have been discussed and agreement reached. \u201cIf we are serious and we really want to resolve this problem, it should not take two days. Two weeks is too long for resolution. They should just come back to us and say, \u2018sign,\u201d he said on a live television programme last night.\n\nEarlier, while addressing a press conference in Abuja, Prof. Osodeke, said the contentious issues would have been resolved and the strike called off long ago if not for the \u201coverzealousness\u201d of Dr. Ngige. He accused the minister of hijacking the negotiation process at the early stage from the Ministry of Education, even when significant progress was being recorded towards resolving the strike.\n\nIt also accused Ngige of taking upon himself the role of unabashed protagonist in the ongoing dispute with Federal Government for some inexplicable reasons, even when he earlier said he was not the employer of university academics and advised the union to march to the Federal Ministry of Education with their grievances.\n\nSSANU threatens to act against disparities in salary\n\nMeanwhile, SSANU has warned that Professor Nimi-Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 Agreement that it will not accept any disparity in University staff salary and would take every legal action against such agenda.\n\nNational President of SSANU, Mohammed Ibrahim, stated this in a statement in Abuja on the alleged proposed salary disparity by the Nimi-Briggs Committee for university staff.\n\n\u201cWe have read in the media that there is a proposal for the review of salary for University staff with a differential of teaching staff taking between 108 to 180 percent and unreasonable of 10 percent for non teaching staff. We are shocked to read that the Nimi Briggs Committee has submitted a report to the government while we only met with them twice. To say the least, SSANU is not happy with the pace of work in that committee.\n\n\u201cWhile we only met twice with them, we are aware that they have met with the teaching staff not less than ten times. We are surprised how the so-called percentage was allocated to non teaching staff. We have not had the opportunity of discussing salary review with them because the committee stated that they have not gotten the approval of their principal to discuss that. We are seriously shocked and taken aback by the media report that a certain miserable, unacceptable percentage was recommended to non teaching staff. We therefore advise that that committee should as a matter of urgency, conclude renegotiation with us.\u201d\n\nHe also commended President Buhari for his intervention in the ongoing strike and praised Senator Ngige for what it described as his dexterity in ensuring that all university-based unions are carried along in the renegotiation exercise.\n\nTUC rallies affiliates for NLC\u2019s ASUU protest\n\nRegardless of efforts to resolve the issues, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has vowed to team up with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on the two days nationwide protest against the lingering crisis in the educational sector.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony of the 12th Triennial National Delegates Conference 2022 in Abuja, outgoing President of the Congress, Quadri Olaleye said the TUC and all its affiliates were in support of the two -day protest scheduled for next week.\n\nThe conference is holding in spite of a court injunction stopping it by a some aggrieved affiliate unions of the TUC over the decision of the next president\n\n\u201cWe are in solidarity with the NLC on the protest coming soon and all our members will be on ground to ensure the success of the protest,\u201d he said.",

The news reported by Daily Post is false. Daily Post and other news outlets should desist from spreading false information about Pastor Adeboye and the RCCG as it defeats the code of ethics of journalism and the full weight of the law will be employed if such happens in the future,\u201d the disclaimer read.\n\nCAN had at the weekend directed all churches in Nigeria to advise their members not to vote any presidential candidates with links to hard drugs, Boko Haram or any violent religious groups. Among the qualities the religious body said Christians should look out for in a candidate are honesty, truthfulness, respect for the rule of law, respect for religious and ethnic diversity, compassionate, disciplined and credible.\n\nThe body said the candidate must not be a member of any cult, must not have any involvement with drugs, witchcraft, Boko Haram or any violent religious group. The candidate is required to have performed excellently in previous positions, must have good education sufficient to manage a complex society, effective management skills of human and natural resources.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian youths under the umbrella of the Youth Wing of Christian Association of Nigeria (YOUWICAN) have joined lots of other Nigerians in condemning the decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to field candidates from same religion, Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian, for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe youths held a peaceful protest in Abuja, yesterday, to herald the commencement of mobilisation against the APC and any other political party that might had fielded candidates from same religion, Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian, for the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nThe North Central Chairman of YOWICAN, Owoyemi Alfred Olushola, told journalists at a press conference in Abuja, that anyone or political party promoting same-faith ticket does not mean well for Nigeria and should be stopped from causing more division in the country.\n\nHe confirmed that the executive members have been mobilised for sensitised at community/family levels to ensure that people understand that implications of the decision, and save themselves and Nigeria from the \u201ccalamity\u201d that might befall it.\n\nThe Christian youth leader described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as adopted by APC as an insult on the sensitivity of Nigerians, and Christian youths have loudly said a big No to that decision.\n\nHe, thus, called on all peace-loving Christian youths and their counterparts in other faiths not to allow themselves to be bought over or cajoled into accepting actions and decisions that are not for the unity and progress of Nigeria.",

          "title": "Buhari unveils NNPC Ltd, assures of value with global best practices",
          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu and Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, (Abuja)\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has officially unveiled the Nigerian National Company Limited (NNPC), with a charge that it must ensure that its over 200 million shareholders and Nigerians at large, get value in line with global best practices.\n\nHe noted that the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 has no doubt give additional impetus for transparent and profitable energy venture.\n\nThe President assured that the NNPC Limited will operate as a commercial, independent and viable NOC at par with its peers around the world, to sustainably deliver value to its over 200 million shareholders and the global energy community, while adhering to its fundamental corporate values of integrity, excellence and sustainability.\n\nWith the NNPC transitioned to a full commercial entity, the Federal Government will henceforth halt all forms of funding for projects and sundry purposes as against what obtained in the last 45 years of the national oil company\u2019s existence.\n\nAccording to the President, Nigeria places high premium in creating the right atmosphere that supports investment and growth to boost her economy and continue to play on important role in sustaining global energy requirements.\n\n\u201cWe are transforming our petroleum industry, to strengthen its capacity and market relevance for the present and future global energy priorities.\n\n\u201cBy chance of history, I was privileged to lead the creation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the July 1, 1977. Forty-Four years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u201cIt will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorised transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil company today.\n\n\u201cI therefore thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play on important role in shaping the destiny our National Oil Company from the good to the great.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that NNPC Ltd is mandated by law to ensure Nigeria\u2019s National Energy Security is guaranteed to support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nHe added that the NNPC Ltd will focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice \u201cto deliver energy for today for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said with the signing of the PIA, which assures international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, the nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless.\n\n\u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr. President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments. In fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 percent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSylva described the unveiling of NNPC Ltd as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the President for his unparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support towards ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u201cbest human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the consequences of the development, former Director, Centre for Petroleum, Energy Economics and Law, University of Ibadan, Prof Adeola Adenikinju, said for the country to ensure energy security it must take the issues of energy affordability, storage, investment and diversification of its energy mix seriously.\n\nHe noted that a situation where energy is concentrated through a single source was not economically acceptable, noting\n\nthat the country must begun to take the issue of renewable seriously to have a balanced energy mix.\n\nHe equally noted that a situation where we don\u2019t encourage indigenous production and refining of Petroleum products remains a huge set back.\n\nHe said Nigeria is heavily dependent on imported Petroleum products, a development that causes constant disruption in the downstream value chain through frequent fuel scarcity.\n\nOn energy affordability, he said when energy is not made affordable that puts a threat to our existence as more people will embrace the use of dirty fuel which\n\nincluded the use of charcoal and firewood,thereby destroying the environment.\n\nAdenikinju who is currently the Head of Economics Deptartment, University of Ibadan, said storage is another area to take a critical look at,saying our energy security must not be for today alone but for the future as we must develop ways of storing energy.\n\nFor his part, Founder Extractive360, Juliet Ukanwosu, said it will definitely take more than just a name change to achieve energy security and grow our reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2019We now need to begin activating the provisions of the PIA and fully activate what it prescribes to supports the NNPC on a commercial driven path. It is very critical to achieve a deregulated downstream sector and open up the entire value chain to a level playing field, where no stakeholder have undue advantage over the other. I believe the time is now to lift NNPC fuel import monopoly and allow more players in the field with equal access to forex and then allow market forces to determine pump price. Until govt gets off price control, it will be difficult to achieve supply stability, needless to mention the pressure subsidy is putting on the economy.\n\nWith subsidy gone and the market open to healthy competition, the downstream sector will flourish and Nigerians will have better value from the sector.\n\nOn reserve growth, of course full implementation of the PIA is equally key. We need to explore for oil and the right fiscal regime and operating environment is crucial to attracting investors. But bear in mind also that the era of investment rush in oil exploration might be over as companies globally are cutting down investments in fossil fuels. Companies now take their monies to where they can get the best returns.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) has announced it would formally unveil its vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima, to the Nigerian public today.\n\nAPC, in a statement by National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Muhammad Argungu, listed the category of persons invited to the event it described as \u201clandmark official unveiling of our great party\u2019s vice presidential candidate,\u201d to include all members of National Executive Committee, members of the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum, members of APC caucus in the National Assembly, members of the Federal Executive Council, members of the diplomatic corps.\n\n\u201cOthers include presidential aspirants at the June 2022 special national convention, state chairmen, state secretaries and state organising secretaries.\n\nMeanwhile, Tinubu Campaign Organisation (TCO) has said choice of Shettima was not to ignore religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of Nigerians.\n\nDirector, Media and Communication of the TCO, Bayo Onanuga, in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, said the campaign organisation had followed the heated debate that the choice of Shettima as APC vice presidential candidate had generated in the country because he shared same religious faith with Tinubu.\n\n\u201cReligion or ethnicity was far from the calculations of the APC and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in picking his running mate.\n\n\u201cIf Asiwaju intended to cash in on ethnicity, he would have picked a running mate from the North West of Nigeria, which has the highest number of registered voters.\n\n\u201cIf he wanted to appeal to the base instincts of religion, he would have also gone for a candidate in the Christian dominated parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut there was no such consideration, instead he picked a tested politician and technocrat from the minority Kanuri ethnic group from the North East, \u2018\u2019 Onanuga said.\n\nHe said the factors at play were issues germane to confronting the multi-dimensional crisis the country was currently faced with, which included: insecurity, economic problems and unemployment crisis facing our youths.\n\nThe TCO director recalled that Tinubu canvassed on his track record in Lagos State to win the APC primary last May.\n\nHe added that as governor of Lagos from 1999 to 2007, Tinubu was able to transform a decadent state into the fourth biggest economy in Africa.\n\n\u201cHe believes his feat in Lagos State can be replicated all over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo assist him in realising this vision, he picked Shettima, who also established a track record of development in Borno while he was governor of the state for eight years,\u2019\u2019 Onanuga said.\n\nHe added that this was despite the Boko Haram crisis, saying surely, only the deep knew how to call onto the deep.\n\nAccording to Onanuga, Nigerians have a lot to gain in having the two tested leaders at the helm of affairs.\n\nHe noted that naturally, some Nigerians with closet motives had failed to see the opportunities and possibilities the twin candidates presented to the country at this time of difficult security, economic and political developments.\n\nHe added that such Nigerians would rather prefer to fan the embers of religion and ethnic divisions among their unsuspecting and vulnerable compatriots.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to Nigerians to embrace the best elements of our common purpose and reject the campaign and incitement against fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cWhen Nigerians stand together, they have been known to achieve incredibly positive outcomes, that is the lesson from our history.\n\n\u201cTo now succumb to the base ends of identity, by further straining our already difficult ethnic and religious cleavages,\n\n\u201cIs a great disservice to the country and to citizens who had no choice about their parentage, ethnicity or religion at birth, either as Christians, Muslims or traditional worshipers.\n\n\u201cAs Nigerians, what should be important to us today and tomorrow is our commonwealth as citizens of this great nation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe recalled that Tinubu, as an individual, had assured Nigerians he was not oblivious of the religious and ethnic sensitivities of the nation, that he picked Shettima in fulfilment of the country\u2019s overriding interest.\n\n\u201cI am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate, just and noble people have talked to me about this.\n\n\u201cBut the assurances I bring is that as president, I hope to govern this country toward greatness and progress.\n\n\u201cDeploying the tools of modern innovation to resolve seemingly intractable problems that have dogged our country and hindered our match toward greatness. I will not and cannot ignore the religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of our people.\n\n\u201cI come from a background and orientation of pluralism that understands that the greatest gift contemporary Nigerian leadership needs today is sensitivity to the management of our complex diversity,\u2019\u2019 Onanuga quoted Tinubu as saying.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has allegedly dismissed no fewer than 80 soldiers from service over 'disobedience to a standing order.'\n\nThe dismissed soldiers were part of the personnel deployed to the 159 Battalion at Baga in Borno State.\n\nOne of the affected soldiers who confirmed the dismissal to SaharaReporters said they were dismissed for withdrawing from the war front after running out of ammunition during a fight with Boko Haram terrorists but without an order telling them to do so.\n\nHe, however, described the punishment meted out to him and his colleagues as not right, arguing that they left the battlefield when their commander was taken off.\n\nThe soldier denied the claim by the army authorities that the soldiers abandoned their duties and ran away.

          "text": "Fresh evidence has emerged in the ongoing legal battle involving Akan Okon vs Peoples Democratic Party, Umo Eno and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the Federal High Court, Uyo regarding forged documents.\n\nMr Okon, a contestant in the May 25 governorship primary election of the PDP in Akwa Ibom is dragging Umo Eno, the winner of the said election to court on the allegations that Eno is parading forged West African Examination Council (WAEC) certificate in his bid to actualise the governorship ambition.\n\nIn a joint statement of defence, Eno and PDP, who are the defendants, have withdrawn the \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 earlier tendered to the court in defence of the certificate forgery allegation.\n\nIt could be recalled that while responding to Mr Okon\u2019s earlier statement of claim to the Federal High Court, Eno had in his first statement of defence attached a copy of \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported how WAEC confirmed that the governorship candidate\u2019s certificate does not exist in its records. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE : Forgery Case: WAEC Confirms School Certificate Of Akwa Ibom Governor\u2019s Stooge, Umo Eno \u2018Does Not Exist In Records\u2019\n\nIn a letter dated April 8, 2022, and signed by T. A. Ademola, WAEC Exams and Records, the examination body stated that it could not certify the certificate because it did not issue it.\n\n\u201cThis is to notify you that certificate No. PO 275878 A for candidate No. 15725119 of December 1983 submitted for certification by you does not exist in our records hence we cannot certify what we did not issue,\u201d the letter had read.\n\nHowever, in the joint statement of defence, Eno has withdrawn the said \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 and replaced it with a \u2018Leaving Certificate and Testimonial\u2019.\n\nBut a thorough examination of the school testimonial reveals more discrepancies.\n\nThe testimonial, which is not in the list of documents submitted to INEC, was issued by Victory High School II, Ikeja, as against the \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 which carried Victory High School I, Ikeja, and WAEC results bearing Victory High School, Ikeja.\n\nAccording to the testimonial dated 10th July 1981, Umo Eno offered \u2018Bible Knowledge\u2019 as one of the subjects in the examination, but his WAEC result of June 1981 records \u2018Religious Knowledge\u2019 as one of the subjects.\n\nAgain, the testimonial indicates that the Akwa Ibom Governor\u2019s stooge offered eight (8) subjects but his WAEC result records four (4) subjects while the withdrawn \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 recorded a total of six (6) subjects with four (4) passes and two (2) failures.\n\nInsider source confirmed to SaharaReporters that Eno's legal team decided to withdraw the \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 having discovered that it was a very poor forgery job, adding that the defendant has ordered the arrest of the two persons who signed the document.\n\n\u201cUmo Eno's lawyers discovered that the confirmation of result was a very bad job, very bad so they decided to withdraw it from the court. As I speak, the two people who signed the forged confirmation of result have been arrested,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source further revealed that Eno's legal team agreed that withdrawing the confirmation of the result will enable them to deny the existence of the document.\n\nHowever, a lawyer told SaharaReporters that the withdrawal of the said confirmation of result does not take away the fact that the document is in existence and has been admitted in court, and can be relied on by the Judge in the course of the trial.\n\nThe Supreme Court in UZODINMA V. IZUNASO 2012 VOL. 211 PG. 153 L.R.C.N AT PAGE 213 PARAGRAPH 33, held; \u201cIt is to be noted, however, that a Statement of Claim or Defence which has been amended with leave of Court does not cease to exist. It is still part of the proceedings and can properly be looked at or referred to by the trial Judge in his Judgment.\u201d\n\nResponding to Okon's allegation that he submitted a voter card with a false date of birth to the PDP screening committee and INEC, Eno said that he provided his correct date of birth to INEC officials during the nationwide voters' registration exercise in 2014, but was surprised to see his date of birth wrongly recorded when he received his voter card.\n\nHe stated that upon noticing the error on his voter card, he \u2018promptly\u2019 informed INEC and based on INEC's advice, he swore an affidavit of correction of date of birth on April 10, 2015.\n\nThe governor\u2019s stooge further revealed that during the ongoing 2022 voters' registration exercise conducted by the electoral body, he visited INEC's registration centre in his community on 14 June 2022 to request for the rectification of his date of birth on his voter card.\n\nBut from our investigations, Eno\u2019s request for rectification only came after Okon had made the allegations of falsification of date of birth.\n\nFurther investigations reveal that Eno has never provided the said affidavit before in any documentation including his credentials to INEC for the 2023 governorship election despite continuously using the same voter card with a false date of birth.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that Umo Eno was mulling a plan to acquire a backdated affidavit to counter the allegations against him.\n\nAll his documents previously submitted to the PDP screening committee and INEC did not include the affidavit.\n\nThe case, which was called for mention on Monday, July 18, 2022, before Justice Agatha A.

Ademola, WAEC Exams and Records, the examination body stated that it could not certify the certificate because it did not issue it.\n\n\u201cThis is to notify you that certificate No. PO 275878 A for candidate No. 15725119 of December 1983 submitted for certification by you does not exist in our records hence we cannot certify what we did not issue,\u201d the letter had read.\n\nHowever, in the joint statement of defence, Eno has withdrawn the said \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 and replaced it with a \u2018Leaving Certificate and Testimonial\u2019.\n\nBut a thorough examination of the school testimonial reveals more discrepancies.\n\nThe testimonial, which is not in the list of documents submitted to INEC, was issued by Victory High School II, Ikeja, as against the \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 which carried Victory High School I, Ikeja, and WAEC results bearing Victory High School, Ikeja.\n\nAccording to the testimonial dated 10th July 1981, Umo Eno offered \u2018Bible Knowledge\u2019 as one of the subjects in the examination, but his WAEC result of June 1981 records \u2018Religious Knowledge\u2019 as one of the subjects.\n\nAgain, the testimonial indicates that the Akwa Ibom Governor\u2019s stooge offered eight (8) subjects but his WAEC result records four (4) subjects while the withdrawn \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 recorded a total of six (6) subjects with four (4) passes and two (2) failures.\n\nInsider source confirmed to SaharaReporters that Eno's legal team decided to withdraw the \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 having discovered that it was a very poor forgery job, adding that the defendant has ordered the arrest of the two persons who signed the document.\n\n\u201cUmo Eno's lawyers discovered that the confirmation of result was a very bad job, very bad so they decided to withdraw it from the court. As I speak, the two people who signed the forged confirmation of result have been arrested,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source further revealed that Eno's legal team agreed that withdrawing the confirmation of the result will enable them to deny the existence of the document.\n\nHowever, a lawyer told SaharaReporters that the withdrawal of the said confirmation of result does not take away the fact that the document is in existence and has been admitted in court, and can be relied on by the Judge in the course of the trial.\n\nThe Supreme Court in UZODINMA V. IZUNASO 2012 VOL. 211 PG. 153 L.R.C.N AT PAGE 213 PARAGRAPH 33, held; \u201cIt is to be noted, however, that a Statement of Claim or Defence which has been amended with leave of Court does not cease to exist. It is still part of the proceedings and can properly be looked at or referred to by the trial Judge in his Judgment.\u201d\n\nResponding to Okon's allegation that he submitted a voter card with a false date of birth to the PDP screening committee and INEC, Eno said that he provided his correct date of birth to INEC officials during the nationwide voters' registration exercise in 2014, but was surprised to see his date of birth wrongly recorded when he received his voter card.\n\nHe stated that upon noticing the error on his voter card, he \u2018promptly\u2019 informed INEC and based on INEC's advice, he swore an affidavit of correction of date of birth on April 10, 2015.\n\nThe governor\u2019s stooge further revealed that during the ongoing 2022 voters' registration exercise conducted by the electoral body, he visited INEC's registration centre in his community on 14 June 2022 to request for the rectification of his date of birth on his voter card.\n\nBut from our investigations, Eno\u2019s request for rectification only came after Okon had made the allegations of falsification of date of birth.\n\nFurther investigations reveal that Eno has never provided the said affidavit before in any documentation including his credentials to INEC for the 2023 governorship election despite continuously using the same voter card with a false date of birth.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that Umo Eno was mulling a plan to acquire a backdated affidavit to counter the allegations against him.\n\nAll his documents previously submitted to the PDP screening committee and INEC did not include the affidavit.\n\nThe case, which was called for mention on Monday, July 18, 2022, before Justice Agatha A. Okeke of the Federal High Court, Uyo, was adjourned to Thursday.",
          "summary": "In a joint statement of defence, Eno and PDP, who are the defendants, have withdrawn the \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 earlier tendered to the court in defence of the certificate forgery allegation.\nIt could be recalled that while responding to Mr Okon\u2019s earlier statement of claim to the Federal High Court, Eno had in his first statement of defence attached a copy of \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019.\nHowever, in the joint statement of defence, Eno has withdrawn the said \u2018Confirmation of Result\u2019 and replaced it with a \u2018Leaving Certificate and Testimonial\u2019.\nAs I speak, the two people who signed the forged confirmation of result have been arrested,\u201d the source said.\nThe case, which was called for mention on Monday, July 18, 2022, before Justice Agatha A.

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two fintech executives and a manager at a US-based money transfer company have been sentenced to a combined 8 years in US federal prison.\n\nThe firm, Ping Express, admitted in US district court filings that it broke money laundering rules after it transferred $167 million out of the US. One hundred and sixty million dollars of that money was sent to Nigeria over a period of 3 years, some of which were proceeds from online romance scams.\n\nAccording to a statement released by US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Chad E. Meacham, the firm admitted it failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme and operated without a licence in at least 5 US states.\n\nPing Express CEO Anslem Oshionebo, 45, and COO Opeyemi Ode, 43, both recently received 27-month prison sentences, and the company\u2019s business manager, Aleoghena Okhumale, received a 42-month prison sentence for intentionally transferring criminal proceeds.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Oshionebo, a former senior manager at PwC, said in an email that he did not have the resources to continue fighting the case and \u201chistory will be the best judge\u201d. On his part, COO Odeyale claimed the case against him had \u201cgross violations\u201d.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Ping\u2019s anti-money laundering policy claimed it limited first-time customer transactions to $499, daily transactions to $3,000, and monthly transactions to $4,500. The company admitted in court filings that it \u201callowed more than 1,500 customers to violate these rules. In one instance, Ping allowed a customer to remit more than $80,000 in a single month\u201417 times more than the purported limit,\u201d read part of the statement.\n\nPing Express also admitted it failed to seek sufficient details about the sources or purposes of the funds it helped to transmit, or the customers initiating the transmissions. By law, the company was supposed to report any suspicious transactions to regulators. But according to the company\u2019s court filings, it failed to make a single anti-money laundering report in 3 years of operation.\n\nAccording to DoJ statements, Collins Orogun, one of Ping\u2019s top customers and a co-defendant in the case, admitted to receiving a fee for laundering money for \u201cromance scam\u201d fraudsters and other criminals. Over a period of 2 years, the DoJ says he received more than $1.3 million in cash, cashier\u2019s cheques, and wires into several US bank accounts he controlled, and then quickly moved more than $1 million of the funds to Africa through Ping.\n\nIn one incident, an Indiana woman wired $15,000 to \u201cCarson Jacks\u201d, a putative oil roughneck in the Gulf of Mexico she fell in love with online, after he claimed to have malaria. Another Indiana woman claimed to have fallen in love online with an Irish ship captain named \u201cThomas Ken\u201d and wired him $6,300 to fix his ship. Orogun facilitated both payments through Ping.\n\nOrogun now faces up to 20 years in federal prison when sentenced on January 23, 2023.\n\nPing Express itself faces up to 5 years of probation and a $500,000 fine.\n\nPing COO Odeyale also founded a UK-registered electronic money firm, Payzen Limited, formerly Clicks FX Limited in 2013. In December 2020, about 10 months after he was formally charged by US DoJ officials for failing to maintain an effective AML programme and operating without a licence, he relinquished his controlling stake in Payzen. The UK business was not mentioned in the US case, but filings on the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) website show that Payzen also trades as Ping Express. Per Bloomberg, the current controlling shareholder of Payzen, Adekanmi Adedire, said that his company is \u201cunrelated\u201d to Ping Express, which is a \u201ctotally different entity\u201d. However, Payzen\u2019s website on the FCA\u2019s online database is still listed as ping-express.com.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "\u201cHR is something you learn by doing. It is experience, not book. Yes, there are certifications, but those certifications are handy after you\u2019ve worked a while and you know where you want to focus.\u201c \u2013 Weyinmi Barber, SVP, People and Culture, Softcom.\n\nA well-known irony in the job market is that some jobs or industries that were sought after some 10 to 15 years ago no longer occupy that position and others have had to simply evolve to stay relevant. While it looks grim for those ones, some jobs that are now highly rated might also start struggling with relevance in a few years.\n\nSome roles like human resources (HR) have survived every evolution the job market has experienced, yet it remains one of the most underrated in companies. It would be great to dive into why this is so straight away, but we will get there soon.\n\nI was at the Softcom head office in Ikeja on a warm July afternoon to speak with Weyinmi Barber, the SVP, People and Culture, a.k.a, head of HR. While we prepped for our conversation, I was determined to get her take on why startups do not pay attention to HR despite its implied importance. And her response was not far from my theory.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand how important it is. What usually happens with startups is they get to a certain level and they start having HR crisis and at that point, they are running around looking for HR professionals.\u201d\n\nIn conversation with Weyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom at the Softcom Head office, Ikeja, Lagos\n\nFrom the hour-long chat, I deduced how important it is to have an HR team, from easily hiring the right people to having a defined recruitment process and everything in between.\n\nIt is safe to say that Weyinmi Barber is passionate about HR and is on a mission to make it desirable despite people\u2019s misconceptions. Like me, when you get to know about her quirkiness from childhood, you\u2019d understand that she has been giving away the \u2018people\u2019 vibe for a long time.\n\nFinding a path that fits\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nWarri-born Weyinmi still reminisces about her childhood in Delta State, Nigeria, when she spent a lot of time outdoors with other children. Recalling her adrenalin rushes as parents called out to their children at the end of day, she recounted how her favourite time was the twilight, just before sunset.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the Weyinmi we see today, and her parents\u2019 influence contributed largely to it.\n\nWeyinmi\u2019s quest for knowledge to satisfy her curiosity drove her towards books and she tried to associate what she read with real life. Consequently, she built her vocabulary and was comfortable with long texts in school. Expectedly, she developed a vibrant and artistic personality, asking many questions and trying her hands at different crafts.\n\nWeyinmi is careful not to attribute her success to only her work.\n\n\u201cI grew up with parents who valued education,\u201d she said.\n\nPaying attention to everything she loved doing, they were ready to support her in whatever field she chose. We smiled about how she went through various phases trying to choose a career based on self-discovery at different points of her life. It was writing at one point and fashion management at another, with management consulting coming up later in university.\n\nAt a time when the information technology (IT) industry was unpopular, Weyinmi chose to study information resources management at Babcock University, graduating as the year\u2019s overall best student.\n\nBut after graduation, she did not have the best experience practising as an information management analyst. In hindsight, it would have been different if she was exposed to the suitable side of the tech industry.\n\n\u201cFor the first two years of my career, I was an IT person but I didn\u2019t really like it. I\u2019ve now been told that I didn\u2019t get the right exposure to tech, to the software side of things.\u201d\n\nWorking in IT more than a decade ago did not necessarily mean you were into software engineering or app development, as is often the case today. The roles were mostly administrative and tech support-related, none of which appealed to Weyinmi. After a while, she decided to get a master\u2019s degree, and got a scholarship \u2014 thanks to her excellent record during her first degree \u2014 to study management and business excellence at the University of Warwick, UK.\n\n\u201cI was very fortunate to go to a school with a career centre. You could go there and have conversations with people, get counsel about what kind of career path you should consider based on your personality, temperament, and strengths. One of the career options that came up for me was HR.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nThis was a revelation for Weyinmi as her discipline was quite different from her dispositions. She made a mental note to seek a job in HR job once she resumed job hunting and her first job back in Nigeria was at Oando Plc, a multinational in the oil and gas sector.\n\nBecause Weyinmi is driven by the need to have an impact, she has learnt to let time take its course, constantly reminded by a Warren Buffet quote that \u201cYou can\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to be associated with things that are working, successful, and good. That really drives me and my work ethic.\u201d\n\nBut, changing industries wasn\u2019t as easy as opening a new page or skimming over a paragraph.\n\nTwo years might seem like enough time to build expertise in a field, but Weyinmi\u2019s decision to give up information analysis to pursue HR was a challenge, and she felt she was already behind her peers.\n\n\u201cI really threw myself into it because I had that sense of \u2018I need to catch up. I really need to learn as much as I can and as quick as possible so that I can start to see the kind of growth that I want for my career.\u2019 Because of that, I was very intentional about developing myself.\u201d\n\nConsequently, she took risks to ensure consistent development, one of which was turning down a senior role in another department to spend more time where she was to develop expertise.\n\nIn eight years, she had filled HR support, analyst, business partnership, and compensation and benefits specialist roles. But then, she was ready for another adventure, this time in a contrasting industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently building my career in HR leadership in the tech startup space,and I really enjoy what I do. I was very fortunate to have intentionally chosen a career path that I believed was a good fit. And the last two years have been HR in the tech startup space.\u201d\n\nA whole new world of HR\n\nWeyinmi Barber having a chat with other Softcom employees (Softcomers)\n\nIn 2020, Weyinmi joined Softcom and developed an organisational framework for the tech company, an achievement she considers one of her highest points to date. She believes the tech space is a great fit for her, and she sees herself spending many years in the industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the challenge, I enjoy being around tech people, I enjoy the conversations, the energy, and most of all, I really enjoy that sense of connection to purpose. I haven\u2019t seen it in any other industry.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi is quick to add the striking difference between the corporate and startup space. After eight years in the oil and gas sector, you would have thought she\u2019d seen it all, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cI did HR for many years, but the tech space is different. Many of the things that are considered best practices in HR work in other industries, but they don\u2019t work in the startup space. So you have to do things differently.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned particularly how the \u201cpeople issues\u201d are unique and created a scenario to pass the message.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of traditional industries, maybe banking and consulting, there\u2019s generally a correlation between your competence and years of experience. That doesn\u2019t work in the tech space, especially for engineers, because someone who has really developed themselves in two years might be writing better code than someone who has been doing it for six years,\u201d she explained.\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nTo keep up with industry requirements, Weyinmi has kept herself relevant by doing professional courses. But that\u2019s not all.\n\n\u201cOne thing I really had to learn was stakeholder management. What I learnt is how to listen to all the sides of the story.\u201d\n\nShe went on to mention how this has helped her understand human behaviour and make better judgement, especially in arbitration cases.\n\nSatisfaction, for her, comes in various forms, but she thoroughly enjoys seeing her solutions solve real-life problems.\n\n\u201cI like creating initiatives to solve problems. Then you roll out the initiative and you see it work, and then you\u2019re getting feedback from people. It\u2019s very satisfying.\u201d\n\nGetting a grip on HR\n\nThe past decade has seen Weyinmi in learning and development, talent acquisition/recruitment, compensation and benefits, and HR business partnership, among others,all of which have improved her expertise.\n\n\u201cI was very lucky to be in different roles, it wasn\u2019t like I was doing the same thing. What that helped me do was have time to figure out where in HR do I want to focus?\u201d\n\nAnd having to spend an average of two years in some of these departments, Weyinmi is sure where she fits.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I realised that the aspect of HR I really liked was organisational design. That\u2019s where you develop HR strategies and come up with initiatives to try and solve people issues, whether it\u2019s building a career framework, developing a talent management framework and applying it to your organisation.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi Barber chatting with Softcom COO, Adetoyosi Elegbede\n\nFor context, when there\u2019s a particular people problem in an organisation, the HR professional\u2019s job is to develop a framework to address it and that is applicable for future occurrences. Since no two organisations are the same, the professional has to come up with bespoke solutions for the company, to achieve optimal results.\n\nWeyinmi is proud to have made the employees of 15-year-old Softcom happy. The tech company is the parent company of a number of startups including Eyowo, Kwiksell, Useform, and Usepass.\n\n\u201cI was privileged to build Softwork\u2019s first career framework. Now, every Softcomer knows their band level, they know what the next level is, they know what they have to do to go to another level, and they know the time of the year promotion happens. We built a policy around that,\u201d she noted.\n\nWith people changing career paths easily, she\u2019s doing her best to match the uniqueness of the startup space.\n\n\u201cThey come in as one thing, six months later they are doing something else, and you have to figure out a way that they can grow.\u201d\n\nDuring our chat, Weyinmi categorised the things people looking to get into HR should know based on where they are in their careers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still in school or a fresh graduate, look for opportunities to do internships in HR departments of companies in different industries. This will help you understand the kind of HR you prefer.\n\n\u201cIf you already have a job, you can have a conversation with your line manager and the people in your HR department and let them know you are interested. If there\u2019s an opportunity for you to move into the HR team, [take it]. If you go and look for a job in another company, you might not get it because, on paper, you do not have the experience.\u201d\n\nShe also revealed what a professional should expect while joining a team.\n\n\u201cUsually, if you\u2019re the first HR professional to join a startup, you\u2019re literally walking into a storm unless you are lucky to have a founder or co-founder who has had exposure to certain environments and they understand that HR is an important need from get-go. It sometimes takes that storm for the leaders to then realise that they need an HR team.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi listed communication, stakeholder management, behavioural science knowledge, and good presentation skills as important soft skills to acquire while considering a role in HR. And depending on the area of specialisation, it is important to develop proficiency in using spreadsheets and be comfortable with numbers, project management, and administration.\n\nOpening up about how it feels to be an HR professional, she said,\n\n\u201cIt can be very lonely and isolatory being an HR professional. People almost see you like the police of the company, forgetting that you\u2019re an employee too with a career to build and goals and aspirations. Having your peers behave differently around you is not fun.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi\u2019s activities on a typical work day depend on what is going on at the company. Responsibilities during recruitment differ from those during employee appraisal.\n\nShe\u2019s a big supporter of the hybrid work style and how it\u2019s great for work-life balance.\n\nFor productivity, \u201cI set alarms/reminders for the most random things. It helps me to be productive. Another thing that helps with productivity is knowing what time of the day you function best so that you can schedule important tasks for that time of the day.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi has bungee jumping and sky diving on her bucket list and sometimes refers to herself as an adrenaline junkie.\n\nSet a reminder for the next episode.",

It is better to stay alive and travel the next day than to endanger your life at night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleading with the three baales here to help us achieve this,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also urged boat drivers not to drive without paddles as they would be unable to ferry such boats to the nearest shore in the event of sudden engine failure.\n\nA youth Leader at Sagbo Koji, Mr Bobby Sanni, advised the authority to include youths in their task force because.\n\nHe said that policemen and NIWA operatives closed from jetties at 6.00 p.m. but youths could stay longer.\n\nAt the Irede in Oriade, a cleric, Mr Kareem Isah, told NIWA that passengers were the ones violating the rules as they rejected life jackets sometimes.\n\n\u201cMost of the life jackets given to passengers are very dirty and they cannot put them on,\u201d he, however, said.\n\nThe Ovori of Ibeshe, Oba Alani Gausu and some community leaders \u2013 Baale Anthony Avime, Sagbo Koji; Baale Houeto Bernard, Whla Koji and Baale Sohome Bishop Koji commended NIWA for the sensitisation visit.

          "text": "Mr Aliyu Abubakar, a defence witness in the trial-within-trial of Justice Mohammed Adoke, former Minister of Justice, has told a Federal High Court, Abuja that an EFCC officer forced him to indict Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria\u2019s former president, in alleged money laundering.\n\nAbubakar, who is also a co-defendant in the suit, told Justice Inyang Ekwo while being led in evidence by his counsel, Wole Olanipekun, SAN, that the officer, Mr Bala Sanga, also threatened him to indict the minister.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adoke was the Minister of Justice during President Jonathan\u2019s administration between April 6, 2010, and April 29, 2015.\n\nNAN reported that Aminu Lawal, the second prosecution witness in the trial-within-trial, had, on May 10, said that Abubakar was neither enforced to make statements nor induced to implicate others in the course of the investigation, and that he was never threatened to be detained.\n\nLawal was part of the investigators who took the defendant\u2019s statements on Dec. 31, 2019 and on Jan. 6, 2020.\n\nBut at the resumed trial on Tuesday, Abubakar, a business mogul, told the judge that the extra-judicial statements he made on Dec. 31, 2019 and on Jan. 6, 2020 were not made voluntarily.\n\nHe said on Dec. 31, 2019 when he was invited to the EFCC\u2019s office, Sanga, threatened to detain him if he refused to make extra-judicial statement.\n\nBesides, Abubakar said on Jan. 6, 2022, Sanga, who introduced himself as the new prosecutor in the matter, told him that there was an evidence before him (Sanga) which showed that he (Abubakar) gave the sum of 20 million dollars to Adoke.\n\nAbubakar also told the court that Sanga informed him that there was another evidence which indicated that he (Abubakar) gave the sum of 50 million dollars to ex-President Jonathan.\n\n\u201cOn the 31st December, 2019, my lawyer, Ahmed Audu, came to me and said one Ibrahim Ahmed from EFCC called him that they needed clarification from me about this case.\n\n\u201cI followed my lawyer to the EFCC office. When I got there, some of the EFCC\u2019s staff like Ibrahim, Babaginda and others came in and told me that I must give a confessional statement.\n\n\u201cThey said that things have changed and somebody has to record me (on video), that his name is Bala Sanga.\n\n\u201cHe introduced himself as the new prosecutor in this case. He thanked me and said I should continue to cooperate with them and that they will help me if I continue to cooperate with them.\n\n\u201cHe then asked me questions. He asked my lawyer to write for me and I said no that I will not make any more statements because I had already made statements which are with them.\n\n\u201cHe said if I don\u2019t, they will detain me,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nHe said due to the fact that it was festive period then, he had to succumb to the officer\u2019s instruction.\n\n\u201cI realised the next day was January 1, 2020, that was why I decided that they should write for me,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen Olanipekun asked Abubakar if he had ever met Sanga in the court before, he said: \u201cYes, I met him here and he is the prosecutor and the one that was investigating me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his experience at the anti-graft agency\u2019s office, he said: \u201cThat day we went to the EFCC and they ask us to come the second day. Bala Sanga called me to one side that Alhaji, I want to help you in this case.\n\n\u201cHe (Sanga) asked how close I am to Adoke. He said you have to sacrifice somebody to be alive.\n\n\u201cHe said there is evidence before him which he will show me at the right time; that he heard information that I gave Adoke 20 million dollars.\n\n\u201cI said what? How did it come?\n\n\u201cHe said maybe because me and Adoke are from the same place and that that was why I did not want to say anything.\n\n\u201cHe also said that there is evidence before him that I gave Goodluck Jonathan 50 million dollars.\n\n\u201cHe said if I did not agree to cooperate with him, he would charge me to court.\n\n\u201cSo I said he should go ahead.\u201d\n\nAbubakar said the argument by the anti-graft agency that nobody asked him to implicate anybody was untrue.\n\nAdoke\u2019s counsel, Kanu Agabi, SAN, while crossed-examining Abubakar, asked him to reconfirm his statement that Sanga told him to implicate Adoke and he answered in the affirmative.\n\nCounsel for the EFCC, Offem Uket, during his cross-examination, told Abubakar that the statements he made on Dec. 31, 2019, and Jan. 6, 2020, were voluntarily made.\n\nHe said in the video clip played in the open court in the last adjourned date, Abubakar did not protest against the directive by the agency\u2019s officers on making the extra-judicial statements but the witness disagreed with Uket.\n\nAlso, the second defence witness, Ahmed Audu, who is Abubakar\u2019s lawyer, also testified in the matter after Abubakar was discharged from witness box.\n\nAudu said he wrote the statement on Abubakar\u2019s behalf on Dec. 31, 2019.\n\n\u201cSanga came in that day and asked my name and I said Barrister Ahmed.\n\n\u201dHe said he was the new prosecutor in this matter and he took over from one Aliyu Yusuf.\n\n\u201cHe said he needed some clarifications from us and my client rejected because he had written a number of statements over this matter.\n\n\u201cIbrahim said anything Sanga asked us to do we should do. While we were there, we heard Magu (former EFCC\u2019s chairman)\u2019s siren coming in and I was even sweating and I felt guilty already.\n\n\u201cI ask Ibrahim why did he say that anything he ask us to do do it. That was how we started the statement. That was what happened that day. After the statement, I ask Ahmed Ibrahim can I go with my client.\n\n\u201cThey released us around 7.30pm on that day and we protested that I will not sign and my client too.\n\n\u201cBut they said we will not go until we sign. So they ask us to come on Jan. 6, 2020,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter Uket\u2019s cross-examined Audu, Justice Ekwo adjourned the matter until Sept 28 for hearing.",

We condemn in the strongest terms.\n\n\u201cThe groom and nine persons that came with him for the traditional marriage at Awo Ommamma from the Otulu community in Oru West Local Government Area of Imo were killed while the other 5 other persons are from the Awo Ommamma community in Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cAlso, 32 persons who were viciously attacked in the traditional marriage ceremony by the Ebubeagu operatives are in critical condition in the hospital. Their life is hanging in the balance and they depend on God to make it out alive.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept the killing of 14 innocent youths laying low, Governor Hope Uzodinma must resign within 7 days resign from office as governor of Imo State or be Impeached by the Imo State House of Assembly else the youths will occupy the roads lawfully in protest to demand his resignation as Executive Governor of Imo State. What we are seeing in Imo is longer democracy but tyranny took too far.\n\n\u201cWe are now a laughing stock among the comity of nations because of not having any value for human life and respect for fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is about problem-solving, bringing democracy dividends to the people and making people happy but what we are seeing now in Imo State is the direct opposite of what democracy should be. It has been from one sorrow to another, from one killing of Imo youths to another who is killed under the guise of unknown gunmen.\u201d\n\nThe group was of the view that \u201cThe Killing of these 14 innocent youths in Awo Ommamma whose corpses were dumped in the bush by Ebubeagu Operatives will not be swept under the carpet. With the way and manner, in which Imo youths are being killed on daily basis, Imo youths face a threat of extinction before 2023.\n\n\u201cWe humbly solicit the pro bono legal services of Barr. Femi Falana, SAN, Barr. Mike Ahamba, SAN, Barr. Mike Ozekhome, SAN and all other legal luminaries in the country and outside the country please come to the aid of Imo youths before they are exterminated from the surface of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the Federal Government to move swiftly to ensure that they take care of the medical bills of those 32 persons in the hospital and that they are given the best medical care. We also call on good spiritual individuals touched by the plight of these persons to assist in whatever way they can.\n\n\u201cWe call on the international community, The Prime Minister of Great British, the President of the United States of America President Joe Biden and all lovers of democracy all over the world to beam her searchlight on Imo State in Nigeria to avoid a situation where Imo youths will all be unjustly and brutally exterminated before the gubernatorial election of the state in 2023,\u201d the youths said.",

          "text": "Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea have started talks on commercial partnership to boost gas production for the benefit of both countries.\n\nEquatorial Guinea\u2019s Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Gabriel Lima, made this known while speaking to journalists on Tuesday in Abuja, following the unveiling of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited.\n\nThe Nigerian Government through this measure has officially changed the NNPC from a wholly state-owned outfit to a commercial oil company.\n\nLima noted that strengthening the bilateral relations on oil and gas with Nigeria will help in eradicating energy poverty, increasing and utilizing gas supply for the benefit of African citizens.\n\n\u201cEquatorial Guinea is working close with Nigeria regarding the possibility of utilizing the gas for the benefit of our both people, especially for the purpose eradicating the energy poverty.\n\n\u201cAnd we are working on the possibility to sign a bilateral agreement that will allow more commercial activities to happen between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.\n\n\u201cSo we are just continuing with this cooperation with the aim that very soon we can start the commercial deals between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea especially on the utilization of gas,\u201d Lima said.\n\nThe Minister also said that although the Russian-Ukraine war had imposed a myriad of challenges on Africa, it also presents some opportunities that could be exploited for the benefit of the continent.\n\nHe said urged gas producing countries of Africa to increase gas production for export to generate more revenue.\n\nLima stressed the need for oil and gas producing African countries to learn from the negative impact of the Russian-Ukraine war on their economies and focus on creating their own market.\n\n\u201cAs an oil and gas producer, the Russian-Ukraine war, has a positive and negative. Of course, the positive is very clear.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in the history of Equatorial Guinea we have been able to have more revenue by gas than oil, that is very good for the Ministry of finance.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time it has been a negative because we are still an importing country of refined products so our refined product have been sky rocketed and some of our refined products are subsidized.\n\n\u201cSo in the short term, it is a good benefit but in the long term we are very worried that it will be a demand destruction.\n\n\u201cThe lesson is that we need to focus on creating our own market for many years rather than depending on exporting our products out of the continent.\n\n\u201cWe have big countries, economies in Africa like South Africa, Morocco, even Nigeria. and to be able to do that we need to focus on how to create those market.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem of that is the lack of infrastructure, and this is where I talk about terminals. Because it is very sad to say that even though we are a big producer, even though we can export cargo of one million barrels.\n\n\u201cOne of the critical things is to focus on how we can create our own market to see one of the key solutions is to have more interconnections probably by pipelines that go with oil, gas, LNG,\u201d Lima added.\n\nThe Minister also urged African countries to depeen the collaboration as a strong regional bloc rather than individually.\n\n\u201cAnother key thing is that we need to start thinking regionally rather than on just one country.\n\n\u201cIf you put together Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, it is not enough market.\n\n\u201cBut if you put together Nigeria, Ghana, the Equatorial Guinea, DRC, that is when we are talking about serious business,\u201d Lima added.\n\nLima noted that strengthening the bilateral relations between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea goes beyond the oil and gas sector to expanding trade, establishing a direct air link between both countries, sharing expertise among others.",

          "title": "EFCC extradites FBI-wanted Olamilekan Fatade to US: Case against him",
          "text": "A wire fraud suspect, Idowu Olamilekan Fatade, who was on the wanted list of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, has been extradited to the United States for allegedly stealing over $3.5M worth of equipment in various cities.\n\nFatade\u2019s extradition on 14 July was coordinated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC.\n\nHe was received in the U.S. on 19 July, the Department of Justice in southern New York said.\n\nHis extradition followed a notice from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI New York, through the US Legal Attache for his role in impersonating various cities, state and academic institutions across the United States.\n\nFatade was indicted by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York for offences of wire fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property and identity theft.\n\nThe suspect was arrested on September 30, 2021, by operatives of the EFCC and his extradition trial commenced sometime in November, 2021 before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke of a Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos.\n\nOn May 1, 2022, the Judge granted the request to extradite the suspect to the United States to answer to the criminal charges against him.\n\nUpon his arrival in the United States, the 40 year-old suspect appeared before a United States District Court judge in New York.\n\nFatade is charged with one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 27 years in prison, one count of interstate transportation of stolen property, which carries a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison, and 12 counts of aggravated theft, which carry a mandatory minimum penalty of two years in prison to be run consecutively to any other sentence imposed.\n\nFatade\u2019s offence:\n\nDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Michael J. Driscoll, the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), said Fatade was extradited on fraud and aggravated identity theft charges in connection with a scheme to fraudulently obtain and attempt to obtain millions of dollars of medical equipment, laboratory products, computer equipment and hardware, and other merchandise from suppliers of such merchandise across the United States by impersonating, among other individuals, procurement officials of U.S. state and local governments and educational institutions.\n\nOLAMILEKAN will be presented on Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge James L. Cott. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cFatade Idowu Olamilekan is alleged to have carried out a sprawling criminal scheme to fraudulently obtain medical equipment and other merchandise. Olamilekan allegedly identified U.S. procurement officials, including the Chief Procurement Officer for New York, to then impersonate them and use their credentials to request millions of dollars in equipment shipments from various suppliers without advance payment. Olamileken has now been extradited to the U.S. for his alleged attempt to illegally profiteer from the worldwide pandemic.\u201d\n\nFBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Michael J. Driscoll said: \u201cWe allege Olamilekan impersonated state procurement officials during the height of the pandemic and stole critically-needed medical equipment that was in high demand and short supply. Fraud can have immediate and direct impacts on people, and we remain determined to bring those who commit it to justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the allegations in the Indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court:\n\nFrom at least in or about 2018 through at least on or about September 14, 2020, OLAMILEKAN engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain and attempt to obtain millions of dollars of medical equipment, laboratory products, computer equipment and hardware, and other merchandise from suppliers of such merchandise across the United States by impersonating, among other individuals, procurement officials of U.S. state and local governments and educational institutions. In particular, during the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic, OLAMILEKAN impersonated the Chief Procurement Officer of New York State in an effort to fraudulently obtain medical equipment, including defibrillators. OLAMILEKAN engaged in the following conduct to carry out his criminal scheme:\n\nFirst, OLAMILEKAN engaged in extensive research to identify specific procurement officials of U.S. state and local governments and educational institutions to impersonate and U.S. suppliers of medical, laboratory, and computer equipment to target as part of the scheme. This research included obtaining information about the current suppliers to the state and local governments and educational institutions OLAMILEKAN sought to impersonate and targeting those suppliers in order to avoid arousing suspicion. For example, OLAMILEKAN appears to have specifically targeted a medical supplier that was already providing medical equipment to New York State in or to avoid suspicion when OLAMILEKAN, who was impersonating the Chief Procurement Officer of New York State, contacted the supplier to obtain medical equipment.\n\nSecond, after OLAMILEKAN identified procurement officials to impersonate, he used aliases and a Lithuanian web hosting company to register email accounts with domains that had slight variations from the legitimate email accounts used by procurement officials in order to \u201cspoof\u201d or impersonate those officials\u2019 email accounts (the \u201cspoofed emailed accounts\u201d). The spoofed email accounts used by OLAMILEKAN usually had the same username as the procurement official\u2019s email account but added an extra letter or common domain name to the domain of the email account. These spoofed email accounts were therefore specifically designed to trick suppliers to impersonated procurement officials into thinking the spoofed email accounts were authentic. In total, OLAMILEKAN registered and used spoofed email accounts impersonating at least (i) eight different procurement officials of state and local governments in California, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont; and (ii) three procurement officials of educational institutions located in Georgia and New York.\n\nThird, OLAMILEKAN used the spoofed email accounts to send emails impersonating the procurement official and seeking quotes for medical, laboratory, and computer equipment from targeted suppliers. These emails typically indicated that the payment terms would be \u201cnet 30 days,\u201d which is a standard term of trade credit for government and educational entities that only requires payment for the goods within 30 days of delivery. OLAMILEKAN therefore impersonated the identities of procurement officials of government entities and educational institutions in order to exploit this industry standard and fraudulently obtain equipment without providing any advance payment information or deposit prior to delivery of the equipment.\n\nFinally, once OLAMILEKAN received a response from a targeted supplier, he provided the supplier with a purchase order containing the forged signature of the impersonated procurement official and an address for a warehouse located in the United States for delivery and storage of the equipment purchased. Once the purchased items shipped to the warehouse provided by OLAMILEKAN, he typically had the warehouse re-ship the items to another warehouse and, ultimately, from the United States to locations in Australia, the United Kingdom, and/or Nigeria. OLAMILEKAN also coordinated with the warehouses receiving the shipments from the targeted suppliers using the stolen identity of at least one U.S. resident, thereby further concealing his own identity and avoiding detection of his criminal activity. Because payment was not due to the suppliers until 30 days after delivery of the equipment, OLAMILEKAN was able to take possession of the equipment prior to detection of the fraud, which typically occurred after payment was not received by the supplier within the 30-day period.\n\n* *",

          "text": "Kemi Badenoch has been knocked out from the UK Conservative Party leadership race, leaving three contenders battling to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister.\n\nShe received the backing of just 59 Tories, while 118 supported Rishi Sunak, 92 voted for Penny Mordaunt and Liz Truss was supported by 86 of her colleagues.\n\nThere was one spoiled ballot.\n\nMs Truss appears to have the most momentum, picking up 15 votes on yesterday\u2019s result, while Ms Mordaunt gained 10 and Mr Sunak increased his tally by just three.\n\nThe departure of former equalities minister Ms Badenoch was expected, given she was competing against three MPs with extensive Cabinet experience, and she was always considered one of the race\u2019s underdogs.\n\nTom Tudgendhat, who was eliminated from the contest on Monday evening, was another outsider who progressed much further in the competition than had been expected.\n\nMr Sunak appears guaranteed to reach the final two, as things stand, with Ms Truss and Ms Mordaunt hoping to gain the votes made available by Ms Badenoch leaving the race.\n\nBut Sunak\u2019s lead is dwindling as the other two rivals close the gap.\n\nLawmakers will eliminate one more before the governing party\u2019s 200,000 members choose their new leader, who will automatically become prime minister.\n\nUnlike in 2019, when Johnson was a clear favourite going into the contest, the result is more difficult to forecast, with polls of party members suggesting Sunak would lose to whoever is chosen to face him.\n\nSince Johnson said he would resign earlier this month after his scandal-ridden administration lost the support of many Conservatives, the race to replace him has become increasingly ugly with the contenders trading barbs and challenging records.\n\nMordaunt just held on to second place and thanked colleagues for their support.\n\n\u201cWe are so nearly across the finish line. I am raring to go and excited to put my case to members across the country and win,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Truss said it was \u201ctime for the party to unite behind a candidate who will govern in a Conservative way and who has shown she can deliver time and again\u201d.",

          "text": "Crisis has hit Academic staff Union of Universities (ASUU) as a breakaway faction of the union has dissociated itself from the ongoing strike in Nigerian universities.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Niyi Sunmonu, and the National Publicity Secretary, Ernest Nwoke, on Tuesday.\n\nThe factional group reiterated that it was not a part of the decision to embark on the ongoing strike by ASUU.\n\nThe faction also announced its independence as a union of academics in Nigerian universities.\n\n\u201cThe Congress of University Academics would like to seize this opportunity to announce its independence as a union of academic staff in Nigeria\u2019s public universities. Being a separate and independent union, CONUA has never been part of the decision to embark on the industrial action which has paralysed academic activities in our universities for five months now,\u201d it said.\n\nCONUA said it believed that strikes had a crippling effect on the Nigerian university system.\n\nIt added that the negative effects of the strikes had always been greater than their positive outcomes.\n\nThe union added, \u201cOur strongly-held view is that strikes wreak great havoc on the university system, and the concessions that are earned after every strike, over the decades, have amounted to pyrrhic victories when weighed against the systematic destruction of the local and global image of university education in Nigeria. Our preferred alternatives to strikes in resolving industrial disputes, therefore, include constructive engagement and constant dialogue with all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cAs CONUA, we are of the strong belief that strikes should never be a strategy of first recourse. Their deployment should be contemplated only when all other options have failed, and they should not appear to be motivated by a desire to cause maximum damage.\u201d\n\nThe union noted that its members have continued with academic activities at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, and Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma after the strike declared by ASUU.\n\n\u201cIn fact, before the incident, which caused the students to be asked to vacate the campus, most of our members had concluded their lectures. Since it wasn\u2019t our members who declared a strike, lumping us together with those who are on strike is therefore patently unfair,\u201d it said.\n\nMeanwhile, the union has decried the conditions of service of Nigerian academics and the inconsistencies associated with the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System, both major demands of the striking ASUU.\n\nCONUA said the condition of service of the academics was one of the poorest on the African continent.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, CONUA notes, regrettably, that the condition of service of academics in Nigeria is very poor. It is, in fact, pitiable. Research has, in this regard, shown that Nigerian academics are among the worst remunerated when compared to their counterparts on the African continent,\u201d CONUA said.\n\nThe union added that it wrote to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, demanding the \u201creview of the pay structure of all academic staff in our universities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe in the urgency of such an action, and would continue to work towards the well-deserved improvement in the condition of service,\u201d it noted.\n\nThe statement also stated that CONUA believed that there were a lot of problems with the IPPIS, the current payment system.\n\nIt listed problems to include inconsistent deductions, and the erosion of university autonomy, saying it undermined the authority of vice-chancellors as chief executives and accounting officers of their respective institutions.\n\n\u201cCONUA, however, believes that these are issues that can be sorted out through dispassionate, well-meaning collective efforts, and is ready to offer the professional expertise of its members to the government to solve the problems.\n\n\u201cFinally, CONUA calls on the government to expeditiously register the union in order to provide a more robust platform for academics with alternative, pragmatic and more sustainable views to operate and engage with the government,\u201d the union added.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) says the two-week ultimatum issued by the President to resolve the concerns raised by the union is too much.\n\nFor the lecturers, it will not take more than two days to address the issues that have plunged the nation\u2019s public university system into a prolonged strike that is currently in its fifth month.\n\nASUU Chairman, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, stated this in Abuja when he appeared as a guest on Tuesday\u2019s edition of Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks is too long,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue of renegotiation has been completed by both sides. Just come back to us and say \u2018we have agreed\u2019, that will not take two days. We were told they spent billions to feed children in school; is that correct, how many children have you seen being fed?\n\n\u201cNigerians spend not less than N200 billion as school fees paid to Ghanaian universities every year. Government should prioritise education as number one in the country because all of us must pass through the school.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Directs Education Minister To Proffer Solution To ASUU Strike In Two Weeks\n\nHours before Osodeke\u2019s interview, President Muhammadu Buhari met with the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, and relevant members of his cabinet where he received briefings on the current face-off between the government and university unions, including ASUU.\n\nAt the meeting, he directed the education minister to proffer a solution to the continued industrial action by the lecturers and report back to him in two weeks.\n\nPresident Buhari had also instructed the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, as well as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who were also present, to be in attendance in all the meetings to speedily resolve the crisis.\n\nWhile the ASUU president sees the President\u2019s action as a welcome development, he is of the opinion that giving such a directive is not new.\n\nHe believes the government is still unserious with the lingering strike by the university lecturers, stressing that it does not require such a long timeframe to resolve the issues.\n\nProfessor Osodeke recalled the intervention of religious leaders in the crisis under the auspices of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) who met with the President over the matter.\n\nFollowing the meeting in February, he explained that President Buhari set up a three-man committee comprising his Chief of Staff, Ngige, and Adamu, to quickly resolve the issue within one month.\n\n\u201cThat committee didn\u2019t invite us for a meeting until we rolled over the strike in May and we all went. Now another 12 days? If we are serious, if we really want to resolve this problem, it will not take two days.\n\n\u201cAll issues have been discussed, government representatives have met with ASUU, and there is a draft joint agreement to look at and come back for the signature. Does it take you two weeks to look at what you have negotiated?\u201d the ASUU president queried.",

However, not curtailing inflation now could erode the monetary gains achieved in improving consumer purchasing power and thus worsen the poverty level for the vulnerable populace.\u201d\n\nThe monetary policy rate (MPR) is the main interest rate in a country or economy on which all other interest rates in that economy are based.\n\nWhile the apex bank increased the MPR rate, it, however, retained other parameters.\n\nThe asymmetric corridor remains +100 and -700 basis points around the MPR, and the well as Cash Reserved Ratio (CRR) at 27 percent.\n\nHe added, \u201cCommittee thus vote unanimously to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). One member voted to increase the MPR by 150 basis points, six members by 100 basis points, one member by 75 basis points and three members by 50 basis points.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Committee resolved to increase the MPR by 100 basis points from 13 percent to 14 percent. In summary, MPC voted as follows:\n\n\u201cIncrease MPR to 14% from 13, retain the Asymmetric Corridor at +100 and -700 basis points around the MPR, retain the CRR at 27.5 percent and retain liquidity ratio at 30 percent.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s rate hike marks the second time, the MPC will raise the interest rate in two months.\n\nThe MPC increased the rate from 11.5 percent to 13 percent on May 24.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, is worried about the implication of the new interest rate for the economy.\n\nAlthough the MPC expects the step to tame inflation, Dr Yusuf, thinks the opposite may be the case.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about MPR hike because it will burden manufacturers and investors; factors driving inflation in Nigeria different from factors driving inflation in other countries CBN is comparing Nigeria with,\u201d he said during an appearance on Channels Television\u2019s live show on the MPC decision.",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja unveiled the new Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, affirming that the company is mandated by law to ensure that Nigeria\u2019s national energy security is guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking at the historic occasion at State House Conference Centre, Buhari said Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company (NOC) would also support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nAt the event, which featured a Special rendition of the Theme Song \u201dEnergy for today, Energy for tomorrow, Energy for Everyone\u201d by an Ensemble, the President recounted how God has used him to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of the country\u2019s NOC in the last 45 years.\n\nHe expressed optimism that NNPC Limited will sustainably deliver value to its over 200 million shareholders and the global energy community; operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account (TSA).\n\n\u2018\u2018This is a landmark event for the Nigerian oil industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our country places high premium in creating the right atmosphere that supports investment and growth to boost our economy and continue to play an important role in sustaining global energy requirements.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are transforming our petroleum industry, to strengthen its capacity and market relevance for the present and future global energy priorities.\n\n\u2018\u2018By chance of history, I was privileged to lead the creation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the 1st July 1977. Forty-Four (44) years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector.\n\n\u2018\u2018The provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u2018\u2018Coincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorized transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company today.\n\n\u2018\u2018I therefore thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of our National Oil Company from the good to the great.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President, therefore, assured stakeholders in the industry that Africa\u2019s largest NOC will adhere to its fundamental corporate values of Integrity, Excellence and Sustainability, while operating as a commercial, independent and viable NOC at par with its peers around the world.\n\nHe added that the company would focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice to deliver energy for today, for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said with the signing of the PIA, which assures international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, the nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless.\n\n\u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr. President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments. In fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 percent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSylva described the unveiling of NNPC Limited as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the President for his unparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support towards ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u2018\u2018best human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018NNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEditor",

I have already directed the head of the NFF Head of Integrity to handle the investigation.\u201d\n\nA source close to Remo Stars owner Kunle Soname told ESPN that the club decided to deliberately lose the shootout in protest at perceived poor treatment of the club by the Ogun State FA and consistent controversial calls from the referee.\n\n\u201cOur club has been constantly treated poorly by the FA, and we did not even want to enter for this competition but we were prevailed upon to enter for it. At the final, the referee made some dodgy calls, even denying us what was a clear penalty kick,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cThe referee wanted the game to go to penalties, he signaled just one minute of additional time.\n\n\u201cThat was the last straw for us, and we decided we would not play the penalty shootout and they should simply give us the silver medals for second place. But they told us we had to play or we could be disqualified for not concluding the game and putting the game to disrepute.\n\n\u201cSo we said we could play, but playing does not mean we have to score.\u201d\n\nHowever, following widespread backlash, the official said the club now regret the action and are braced for whatever sanction will be imposed.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, we can now see that that was a mistake as well. It is being made to look even worse than our initial decision not to play at all,\u201d the source added.\n\nSanusi said NFF President Amaju Pinnick, who is in Morocco for the Women\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations, has added his weight to the investigation, while Ogun State Football Association chairman Ganiyu Majekodunmi said they are looking into the matter.\n\nBarring disqualification, Remo Stars will join Ijebu United as the Ogun State representatives to the National FA Cup competition.\n\nESPN",

The operation is part of Mr Erdogan\u2019s plans to create to create a 30km (20 mile) safe zone along Turkey\u2019s border with Syria.\n\nLast week, the UN Security Council agreed to reauthorise cross-border deliveries of aid to rebel-held Syria for six months after Russia had initially blocked a proposal for a one-year extension.\n\nAnkara has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow since Mr Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, with Mr Erdogan\u2019s government seeking to play the role of mediator.\n\nThe meeting could offer an opportunity for the Turkish leader to conclude a tentative agreement struck between Russian and Ukrainian leaders to ensure the export of 22 million tonnes of desperately needed grain.\n\nLast week, Turkey\u2019s defence minister said both sides had agreed on ways to ensure the safety of shipping routes for grain ships.\n\nRussia\u2019s Black Sea fleet is said to be stopping any shipments getting in or out, and the BBC has documented mounting evidence that Moscow\u2019s forces have stolen and exported Ukrainian grain.
