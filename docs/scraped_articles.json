No longer shall workers sit on the fence.\n\n\u201cThose of them that will not come to tell us what they would do for Akwa Ibom workers, we will mobilize against them. Therefore, your Excellency that is our major thrust of today\u2019s May Day in Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cAs a Labour centre, we acknowledge and commend your responses to some of the pressing Labour issues placed before your government and encourage you to take decisive actions to resolve all pending issues which will add value to good governance\u201d\n\nComrade James called on the governor to give assent to some bills already passed by the State House of Assembly such as \u201cYouth Development Fund Bill, \u201cBill Establishing Akwa Ibom State College of Science and Technology\u201d, in order to bring about the benefits associated with those bills.\n\nSimilarly, Chairman of the Trade Union Congress( TUC) Akwa Ibom State Council\n\nComrade Dominic Abang expressed concern over unwarranted statements by some political aspirants and their supporters ahead of parties primaries.\n\n\u201cLet it be clear that the Council has not endorsed anyone for any political office in the state, rather we\u2019ll queue behind the man who has the capacity and manifesto that will tackle our problems, and guarantee the interest of Labour.\n\n\u201cAnd we call on all security agencies in the state to be vigilant and proactive in responding to any form of threat to our peaceful co-existence, be it thuggery, cultism, kidnapping, banditry and communal clashes\u201d,\n\nAbang asserted.\n\nAbang who commended the governor for the relative peace being enjoyed in the state, therefore advised politician\u2019s to refrain from making inciting statements that were capable of breaching that existing peace.\n\nHe urged the Federal government to be more proactive over in fighting insecurity lamenting, \u201cIt is worrisome that killing of Nigerians is becoming the order of the day. Our Roads, Airports, and waterways are no longer safe. TUC is deeply concerned and sad over the complete failure of the Federal government in fighting insecurity\u201d\n\nIn his brief remarks, governor Udom Emmanuel who was represented by his deputy, Mr. Moses Ekpo appreciated the workers for the great industrial harmony the State has been enjoying under the current administration.\n\nEmmanuel reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to the workers welfare, noting\n\nthat regular and prompt payment of salaries and pensions even when circumstances were very challenging, demonstrated that the interest and welfare of Akwa Ibom workers remained supreme and enduring.\n\nHe said: \u201cHonestly you have been great partners to the development of our state. The giant strides we have recorded in the almost Seven years of your fruitful partnership and cooperation will not go unnoticed. You have proven yourselves to be passionately committed to the development of our State.\n\n\u201cAnd this is borne out of the fact that whenever we have disagreement, we\u2019ve always found a common ground or mutually beneficial ways of resolving such matters. And I want to thank you for such show of solidarity\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed that government has done its best to address the issue of gratuities, noting: \u201cCurrently the verification exercise for Retired primary School teachers from 2019 to 2021 is ongoing.\n\n\u201cLet me also add that those who have been duly verified have been paid. Pensions are paid regularly. It is however sad that certain people have decided to play politics with the issue of pensions and gratuities in the state\u201d",

R7, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, it is unconstitutional for the 2nd defendant (RMAFC) to refuse or neglect to upwardly review the salaries and allowances of the judicial officers notwithstanding the changing local and international socio-economic realities.\n\nThe plaintiff wants an order compelling the defendants to forthwith activate measures to urgently review judicial officers\u2019 pay, raising that of the CJN to a minimum of N12m monthly, N11m for other Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal President; N10m for other Justice of the Appeal Court, the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and President of the National Industrial Court (NIC).\n\nHon also wants the court to compel the defendants to raise the monthly minimum take-home of a judge of the NIC to N9m; N8m for Chief Judges of High Court of state sand the Federal Capital Territory, while the other judges are entitled to N7m.\n\nHe also seeks an order compelling the RMAFC or any other body assigned its responsibilities, \u201cto, in perpetuity, review and continue to embark upon and carry out, in conjunction with the 3rd defendant (AGF), a yearly or at most a two-yearly review of the salaries and allowances of the judicial officers listed above, with a view to making the said salaries and emolument realistic and befitting of the offices and duties attached to/exercised by such offices.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, no date has yet been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "Following the reactions and counter-reactions that recently greeted the issue of polygamy in the country, the Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has stated that marrying more than one wife in Christendom is not a sin.\n\nWhile stressing that polygamy is a crime against humanity, the popular Pastor maintained that engaging in the act will not pit a man against God.\n\nAccording to Giwa who backed up his claim with bible passages, Abraham and Jacob who married more than one wife made heaven.\n\nHe added that his position on the issue was not in support of polygamy but to let the people know the biblical interpretation of the issue.\n\nThe pastor further maintained that all a man needs to gain the kingdom is to serve God wholeheartedly and diligently.\n\n\u201cAbraham had three wives, Jacob had four. In Matthew: 8 v 11, specifically, Jesus Christ said to his followers that many would come from the East and West and take their place at the seat with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\n\n\u201cHowever, I\u2019m not saying this to support who wants to marry as many as possible but to just set the record straight that polygamy is not a sin.\n\n\u201cAs a polygamist, you must serve God wholeheartedly, maintain justice, equity and fairness between your wives. When God created Adam and Eve, he did not tell them to sleep with each other. After the devil must have deceived Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, then their eyes were opened and sin entered the world.\n\n\u201cThere is no marriage in heaven according to Matthew: 22 v 30. When a group of questioners came to meet Jesus Christ, asking him series of questions about a certain woman who married seven husbands. They asked Jesus that at the resurrection, who will be the real husband of the woman, Jesus answered and said, at the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage.\n\n\u201cIn Genesis chapter: 2 v 24 that people refer to today, that says a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife, the statement was originated from Adam, not God. People should read that chapter very well. Any law that is against polygamy in the bible, originated from people not from God.\n\n\u201cEnoch gave birth to Methuselah while Methuselah produced Lamech who first married two wives in the bible. Look at Enoch, the bible says Enoch did not see death. So he produced Methuselah, Methuselah produced Lamech who started polygamy in the bible. Lamech.\u201d\n\nGiwa stressed that \u201cA man who marries two wives without having a concubine but maintains fairness, justice and equity between them is more honourable in God\u2019s eyes than a man who marries one wife and still sleeps around with different women.\n\n\u201cPolygamy is not criteria to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Your attitude, behaviour and relationship with God and the people will determine whether you will make heaven or not. keep the Lord\u2019s Commandments and serve Him diligently.\n\n\u201cThe way and manner in which God spoke directly to Christian saints in the Old Testaments who married multiple wives, He is not speaking directly to the ones with \u201cOne Wife\u201d nowadays. Because many have moved away from God, but now worshipping and gathering earthly treasures that cannot stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cPolygamy is a crime against humanity, not against God. Our holy God does not give us the law or conditions to marry one or multiple wives.\u201d",

          "text": "Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki yesterday increased the minimum wage to N40,000.\n\nHundreds of suffering pensioners in the state, in black attire, with placards bearing various inscriptions, yesterday protested at the Workers\u2019 Day rally at Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin, disclosing that since their retirement in 2012, they were yet to be paid their gratuities.\n\nOne of the protesting pensioners, Irene Aiguobarueghian, said life had become unbearable for the retirees, urging Obaseki to specially consider their plight.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cI am particularly interested in our senior citizens, because they are some of the most vulnerable in our society. We took interest in payment of outstanding pensions to our pensioners, in spite of the fact that these pensions were owed by the previous administration.\n\n\u201cIn view of the prevailing economy circumstances, I have now approved, effective this May, that the agreement we have reached with the union of pensioners that the harmonised amount be paid from May 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by the pensioners, due to the non-payment of pensions and gratuities to them by the previous government. This responsibility is huge, and it will require substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cWe are not a government that is known for running away from challenges. We will look for a way to tackle this challenge.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged the economic hardship in Nigeria, urging civil servants to take advantage of the opportunities offered by his administration in the agricultural sector, to increase food production in the country.\n\nObasaeki said: \u201cAs we all know, the minimum wage of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend that we do not know that our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo State has decided to review the minimum wage for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000 a month. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of Coronavirus to take this initiative. \u201c\n\n\u201cEven though, we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable the workers to cushion the effects of inflation being faced.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the financial implication of the increase in minimum wage will be heavy and put another burden on Edo government, but as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices, so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nStrong indications have emerged that the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, has sealed the fate of some returning federal lawmakers.\n\nAlready, over 70 per cent of incumbent senators and members of the House of Representatives elected on APC platform have indicated interest to re-contest. However, their fate, especially senators who represent outgoing governors, have reportedly been sealed by Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nA fortnight ago, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, separately appealed to APC leadership to grant automatic tickets to \u2018performing\u2019 members of the National Assembly\n\nLawan had said: \u201cWe expect our party to note that we have done so much in terms of performance and working cooperatively and assiduously with the executive and all leaders in government from the realisation of our mandate for our manifestoes, policies and programmes of our government.\n\n\u201cI think APC National Assembly members deserve a special treat as the speaker said. If someone has made the zeal, I believe it is time for another term for that person.\n\n\u201cI believe it is the experience that members of the National Assembly have gathered that made them perform well. So, I like to say they deserve another term.\u201d\n\nAn APC senator told Daily Sun that jittery lawmakers had mounted pressure on Lawan and Gbajabiamila to prevail on Adamu-led NWC to give them right of first refusal.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

It is a battle of ego.

          "title": "2023: Two Groups Move to Stop PDP Convention over Power Rotation, Zoning",
          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Party appeals ruling to show cause why primary should not be suspended*Second aggrieved group says party can only rotate candidacy, not presidency\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nTwo Groups have moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s silence on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nOne of the groups is led by one of its presidential aspirants and a former Deputy Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Mr. Cosmas Ndukwe, moved to stop the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party\u2019s stand on the issue of rotation of power and zoning.\n\n\n\nThe kernel of their cases are that the PDP over the years had a tradition of power rotation and zoning.\n\nThe group argued that the only office the opposition party has to offer was the presidential candidate, which they argued should rotate between the north and the south\n\n\n\nThey cited the fact that since the return of democracy in 1999, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, from southern Nigeria was the first to govern the country, followed by the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua from the northern part of the country. This was followed by Goodluck Jonathan from the southern part of the country and now Muhammadu Buhari from the north.\n\n\n\nJustice Donatus Okorowo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had last Thursday, ordered the PDP to appear before it on May 5, to show cause why the request of one of its presidential aspirants to stop the scheduled primary election for the selection of the party\u2019s flag bearer in the 2023 presidential election should not be granted.\n\n\n\nThe PDP had fixed May 28, for the conduct of its presidential primary election and to that effect screened the 17 aspirants who obtained the presidential form to run in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nIn the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/508/2022 are the PDP, National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Atu, Senator Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) as 1st to fourth respondents respectively.\n\nRather than grant the request, the judge ordered that the PDP should appear before it and show cause why the court should not accede to the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\n\n\n\nIn the suit filed by his lawyer, Mr Paul Erokoro, Ndukwe also challenged the scheduled presidential primary on the grounds that it breached its own constitution on zoning.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP has a rotation of elective offices in place, and by that arrangement, it ought to be the turn of the south to produce the president.\n\n\n\nAs of last week, it was obvious that the PDP was not considering zoning its Presidential ticket to the south as being clamoured by southern governors and other leaders in the zone.\n\n\n\nAlso, a member of the other group challenging the party over the issue of zoning, who pleaded to remain anonymous, pointed out that, \u201cthe presidency is not for the PDP to give; the only thing the PDP can give is its presidential ticket and that must be rotated.\n\n\n\nBut the PDP has challenged the jurisdiction of a Federal High Court to summon it over the issue which the party described as its internal affairs.\n\n\n\nThis emerged just as former Minister of Police Affairs and member of the zoning committee of the party, Adamu Maina Waziri has called on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket of the party.\n\n\n\nThe PDP in a Notice of Preliminary Objection filed on Friday, by its lawyer, Mr Mahmud Magaji, submitted that the subject matter of the case which borders on whether to zone its presidential ticket to any part of the country was not an issue that the court has the mandate to decide.\n\n\n\nThe PDP asked the court to strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction and also dismiss it for being \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.\n\nAccording to the defendants, \u201cthe cause of action in the suit relates to the internal affairs of a political party and therefore falls within the doctrine of political questions which are non-justiciable\u201d and as such the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of statute-barred, the PDP noted that the cause of action arose from the PDP National Zoning Committee Communique of April 5 whereas the plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed on April 19 (15 days after) in violation of Section 285 of the Constitution which provides for 14 days to file such cases.\n\n\n\nWhile arguing further that the plaintiff lacked the necessary legal right to initiate the case, the PDP submitted that no civil right of the plaintiff has been wrong pursuant to section 6(6) of the Constitution.\n\nThe party, therefore, urged the court to uphold its objection and dismiss the case of the plaintiff, adding that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced or suffer any hardship if the case was dismissed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the 3rd defendant in the suit Senator Anyanwu had approached the Court of Appeal to set aside the order of Justice Okorowo on the defendants to show cause, arguing that the trial judge erred in law when it arrived at that decision without according to them a fair hearing.\n\n\n\nAmong other complaints against the judgment of the lower court was that while the originating summons of Ndukwe was not ripe for hearing, the time for appellants to respond to the suit has also not lapsed, adding that respondents have taken steps to file counter affidavit against the suit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe learned trial judge erred in entertaining an ex parte motion which seeks to stop the presidential primary election of the appellant without hearing notice\u201d, adding that the court further erred in law when it failed to \u201caver its mind to section 84(15) of the Electoral Act, 2022, before making an order to show cause\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe appellant in the Notice of Appeal dated April 29, further urged the court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of Justice Okorowo asking the PDP to show cause why its scheduled primary election should not be halted.\n\nPDP Presidential Ticket: Let Delegates Decide, Ex-minister Tells Party Leaders\n\nMeanwhile, Waziri who called on the NEC of the party to allow the 4,200 delegates expected at the presidential convention decide who would fly the ticket the of the party, also alleged that the issue of zoning in the party was being fuelled by external influences who are not members of the party.\n\n\n\nThe ex-minister claimed that at no time did the PDP mandate General Ibrahim Babangida and Prof. Ango Abdullahi to help it find a consensus candidate for the party\n\nHe said the PDP was not obliged to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election, saying the party was preoccupied to use any legitimate method to win the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are a party in opposition, our concern at the moment is to use any legitimate process to get back to power. It is the ruling party that should be concerned with zoning, but not the PDP. Ours as an opposition party is to win through Democratic measure.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur concern is to allow the delegates to the presidential convention to the analysis and know who out of the cleared presidential aspirants has the competence and strength of character to win the presidential election for the party \u201c\n\nThe former Minister of Police Affairs stressed that Babangida and Abdullahi have no mandate of the party to conduct any consensus for the presidential candidate to emerge.\n\n\n\nAccording to the former minister who is also a member of the 37-man think tank on zoning, who spoke on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, \u201d it is not true that zoning is tearing the PDP apart. It is all about media creation and external influences that are creating the media controversy within the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you not hear what two frontline presidential aspirants, Peter Obi and Emmanuel Udom said the position of the PDP on zoning is supreme as the party decision on this is final. We will enthrone the best method that would be in the interest of the party and democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "RenCap: With Oil Prices above $100 Per Barrel, Impact on Budget will Be Negligible",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA new report by Renaissance Capital (RenCap), a frontier market investment company, has stated that despite crude oil prices at over $100 per barrel, the impact on Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position would remain negligible due to petrol subsidy payments and falling oil production by the country.\n\n\n\nIt also predicted that Nigeria would make a gross revenue of $25 billion from oil sales this year, although this would also have very insignificant impact on the country\u2019s fiscal position.\n\n\n\nIn the report titled, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Budget: Does it benefit from high oil prices?\u201d the firm, which also provides institutional research and financial advisory services, noted that on the fiscal front, the petrol subsidy and falling oil production undermines gains on the government revenue side. It estimated that subsidy cost could increase by $1.5 billion to $2 billion for a $10 per barrel change in the oil price, while net oil revenue could rise between $4 billion and $5 billion, without factoring in other externalities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis implies that Nigeria has a $3 billion net benefit for every $10 per barrel change to the oil price (Brent),\u201d it stated.\n\n\n\nBut explaining that Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position would not benefit from high oil prices in 2022, the report noted that the swelling of the petrol subsidy as oil price increased and the fall in oil production due to theft and underinvestment would combine to hobble any gains from rising oil prices.\n\n\n\nThe federal government recently increased the 2022 subsidy budget from N443 billion to N4 trillion, after it shifted the planned removal of what it terms under-recovery by 18 months.\n\n\n\nRenCap said in the report, \u201cAn 80 per cent increase in the oil price, from $41/bbl to $72/bbl, reduced the budget deficit by about 1 ppt only. 2021 was an outlier. We attribute the widening of the deficit in 2021, despite the high oil price, to the fall in production that countered the price effect.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur \u2018trendline\u2019 suggests that if we assume an average oil price of $100/bbl for 2022 and production at pre-2021 levels, then the FGN\u2019s budget deficit would come in at about 3.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We are forecasting a deficit of 4.7 per cent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the year-to-date average Brent crude price of about $100 per barrel, the Nigerian government, the report stated, took 45 per cent to 50 per cent of gross oil sales in the form of taxes and royalties. The remainder, it added, went to the contractor as cost recovery and profits.\n\n\n\nIt stressed, \u201cIn 2022, at $100/bbl Brent, we estimate that gross oil revenues to the government, mostly taxes and royalties, will be $24.8 billion/N10.3 trillion, that is 4.9 per cent of GDP, assuming the current FX rate of NGN415/$1, and net oil revenues at $17 billion/N7.1 trillion (3.4 per cent of GDP).\n\n\n\n\u201cOf this, 80 per cent stems from onshore/shallow water oil fields and the remainder from deepwater oil fields.\u201d\n\nStill at $100 per barrel, in 2022, it also estimated petrol subsidy to be 34 per cent of the government\u2019s gross oil revenue and 50 per cent of net oil revenues.\n\n\n\nAt the current N415 official rate of the naira to the dollar, on an accruals basis, RenCap estimated that the subsidy ranged between 23 per cent and 27 per cent of gross oil revenue for $60 110/bbl Brent.\n\n\n\nBut it added that the impact of a naira devaluation on the numbers at N500/$ and N600/$ and assuming that the pump price did not change, would raise subsidy to between $10 billion and $11.3 billion.\n\n\n\nAccording to the organisation, that is based on the assumption that Nigeria consumes 23 billion litres of petrol a year (400kbpd), taken from the most recent 12-month consumption data, forecasting that subsidy would only be wiped off when oil prices are below $45-$50 per barrel.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelow this price,\u201d it stated, \u201cthe government\u2019s take of oil proceeds is fully remitted and not undermined by petrol subsidy deductions. The reinstatement of the petrol subsidy in January partly explains the revision of the FY22 budget targets and assumptions, including the widening of the deficit target,\u201d\n\n\n\nIn April, the federal government revised its budget deficit target to four per cent per cent of GDP in 2022, as against its initial target of 3.4 per cent, on the back of new developments, including the Russia/Ukraine situation.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had written to the National Assembly calling for an amendment to the budget, to account for the wider deficit and increase in borrowing.\n\n\n\nBuhari said the new developments included the reinstatement of the petrol subsidy, the sharp increase in oil prices, and significantly lower crude production, mainly due to production shut-ins because of massive crude theft between the production platforms and terminals.\n\n\n\nThe president also proposed adjusting the government\u2019s budget assumptions to include the increase in the oil price benchmark to $73 per barrel, from $62/bbl previously, lower projected crude production to 1.60 mbd, from 1.88mbd previously, and an increase in the estimated provision for the petrol subsidy for 2022 to N4 trillion.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThis is also an increase when compared to the N3 trillion that the NNPC called for in January, soon after it was announced that the subsidy would remain in place.\n\n\n\n\u201cDue to the adjustments, the federation account revenue pool for the three tiers of government is projected to fall by N2.4 trillion (1.1 per cent of GDP, by our estimate), and the FGN\u2019s share by N1.2 trillion (0.6 per cent of GDP).\u201d\n\nThe document projected Nigeria\u2019s 2022 oil production to be within the 1.5 bpd to 1. 7 million bpd range, with 1.6 million bpd as midpoint, comprising one million onshore and shallow water production as well as 500k bpd for deepwater.\n\n\n\nIt explained that after deductions related to the oil and gas sector, including federally funded upstream capex, contributions to the 13 per cent derivation fund for the Niger Delta oil-producing states and other items, Nigeria\u2019s net oil revenue could be $17 billion in 2022.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Anyim: South-east\u2019s Most Important Demand is Reintegration",
          "text": "\n\n* Says agitations will die with Igbo presidency\n\nChuks Okocha\n\nFormer Senate President and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has said the ongoing agitations in some parts of the South East of Nigeria, was a reflection of the level of frustration by people of the zone, whose most important single demand was nothing but reintegration into the country.\n\n\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in the third of a presidential interview series, Anyim, who responded to a question on how to reconcile his presidential bid with the heightened and violent agitation for Biafra by some people from the South-east, however, said with an Igbo presidency, the agitations would die naturally.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose agitating are frustrated, young, South-easterners, and I tell you, maybe I will put it this way, somebody asked me once, what is the single most important demands of the south east? And I replied, the most important single demand of the south-east from Nigeria is reintegration.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce they feel that they have been fully reintegrated into Nigeria, all agitation will naturally be extinguished. So, my position is that if you give them a sense of belonging, and maybe expand opportunities for everybody, and they feel equal as citizens of Nigeria, those agitations will simply be extinguished.\u201d\n\n\n\nPushed further if his aspiration would not make the South East quest for secession a lot easier, Anyim, who was Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), explained that the agitations were not new, but has only been given life, because the issues have not been addressed at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe agitation for Biafra is neither isolated nor new. I remember during the June 12 crisis, there were such huge agitations in the South-west, that it is either they are part of this country, or they are not. And eventually, when one of them became the president of the country, that agitation died out.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also know that the militancy in the Niger Delta was so bad that if not for the way President Olusegun Obasanjo managed it, it would have led to agitations like this, and it was at a time everybody was so scared that if you allow somebody from South-south become president of Nigeria, they will graduate that agitation to secession.\n\n\n\n\u201cImmediately, President Goodluck Jonathan became president of Nigeria, that agitation died. In fact, not when he became president, immediately he became vice president of Nigeria, that agitation died out. IPOB agitation is not the only one in the country today.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are a number of them across the country like the Boko Haram insurgency, like Sunday Igboho\u2019s agitation in the South-west. I believe that if a South-easterner becomes the president of Nigeria, that agitation will die,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAsked what his take on restructuring was and the recent suggestion by a legal luminary, Chief Afe Babalola, that government should try out an interim government that would allow for a period of time to come up with a more viable constitution, Anyim said restructuring meant different things to different people.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cI avoid getting into the controversy of the definition of restructuring, but one thing I know is that the structure the country assumed at independence was extensively negotiated, extensively canvassed and extensively agreed on.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were negotiations, there were constitutional conferences, and even at the last lap, the minorities raised issues or fears and the colonial masters set up the Willink\u2019s Commission to look into their fears. They didn\u2019t just decree a structure for the nation. No, they did not at all.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, if we for any reason think that the present structure we have is not working, we have to sit down discuss it and build a consensus going forward, not anybody waking up to say, this is my definition of restructuring. If you throw in anything by your own definition, it will not work, because other components of the polity will not accept it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I agree that we could present a platform for dialogue, for negotiations, for discussions and build a consensus. Based on that consensus, if we need to make an adjustment, we\u2019ll make an adjustment as agreed by all and such adjustment everybody will commit to it in building the nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t want to go into the meaning of anybody\u2019s definition of restructuring. But I want to believe that if all of us feel that the structure we have today is not what we want, we will all sit over and agree on the structure that works for all of us and now carry on from there.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Babalola, the Ebonyi-born politician said, \u201cI am surprised that Afe Babalola made that suggestion, because one, he is a seasoned lawyer and two, more particularly, because that is unconstitutional. And certainly there can\u2019t be a vacuum. So, what provision of our constitution will authorise interim government?\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you can\u2019t preach the rule of law and step outside the law to set up a structure that cannot work. So, because it\u2019s unconstitutional, it has no space in our system. That cannot work.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I also know that under any government, that the country can still have discussions. The country can still have negotiations and dialogue, and arrive at a consensus, that will be acceptable to everybody and we\u2019ll build our nation on that. So, certainly, that has no space in our system.\u201d\n\n*See full interview on pages 19 \u2013 21\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Ruling party\u2019s position careless, ill-considered, says PANDEF\n\n*APC\u2019s claim, an invitation to anarchy, South-south Elders\u2019 Forum warns*Withdraw statement on zoning, Arewa youths tell Adamu\n\n*APC must zone presidency to South-east, Ohanaeze insists\n\nDeji Elumoye, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Segun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nCondemnations have trailed the claim by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday that it had not decided on where to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had before the party\u2019s March 26 National Convention, stated that even though the ruling party had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Senator Abdullahi Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of Adamu from the North is a strong indication that the presidential candidate of the party will automatically come from the South.\n\n\n\nBut Adamu, who spoke on the controversial zoning issue after presenting the party\u2019s candidate in the forthcoming Ekiti State governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, on Friday, said the party had not taken any zoning decision.\n\n\n\nHe said such a decision would be the job of the entire party, which he said was bigger than himself as chairman.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am today privileged to be the Chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Arewa Consultative Youth Forum (ACYF), and the South-South Elders\u2019 Forum (SSEF) have condemned the indecision of the ruling party.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday said he would support President Muhammadu Buhari and APC\u2019s preferred candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nIn its reaction to APC\u2019s indecision on zoning, PANDEF described Adamu\u2019s claim as careless and ill-considered.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on the issue, PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, noted that with the swapping of positions between the North and South, the understanding was that the presidential candidate of the party would come from the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow can he (Adamu) make such a remark? Do they mean well for this country at all? This is a man who emerged as National Chairman of the party through the instrumentality of zoning,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nHe noted that all the positions in the party had been switched between the South and North.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is an established political stratagem of political parties in the country that any time the national chairmanship position of a party goes to the South, the presidency goes to the North and the other way round. In 2014, the APC zoned its national chairmanship position to the South, and the presidency went to the North; therefore, in 2023, the presidency of the APC, and indeed, any serious political party in Nigeria must go to the South. Anything otherwise would be more than an overture to undesirable cataclysms in the country,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlso reacting, the SSEF warned that any attempt to deny the South the position of the presidential candidate of the APC would be an invitation to anarchy.\n\n\n\nAccording to the National Leader of the SSEF, Chief Anabs Sara-Igbe, such a decision will give ethnic nationalities in the South a sense that they are not wanted in the country.\n\n\n\nSara-Igbe expressed the fear that any attempt to jettison the unwritten gentlemen\u2019s agreement between the North and the South would lead to a catastrophic reaction, the end of which nobody can predict.\n\nOn its part, the ACYF has called on the National Chairman of APC, Adamu, to withdraw his statement that the party had not taken a position on zoning.\n\n\n\nThe ACYF, in a statement yesterday, said the statement credited to Adamu was capable of heating the polity and spelling doom for the party if not quickly withdrawn.\n\n\n\nThe group said it was worrisome that the party chairman could come up with such an inflammable statement when all critical stakeholders are already on the same page on the need for the presidency to return to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate statement credited to Senator Adamu is regrettable just as it is demeaning of his status as the chairman of a ruling party.\n\n\u201cEven a political novice is aware that the consensus from critical political stakeholders is that the presidency must return to the South in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis statement that no agreement had been reached on zoning is not in the best interest of the party.\n\n\u201cThe statement is capable of leading to electoral defeat for our great party if not quickly withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a statement that can confuse, overheat the polity and eventually lead to electoral defeat.\n\n\u201cLeaders must learn to weigh their words and also feel the pulse of the people when making statements on issues as important as this,\u201d AYCF explained.\n\n\n\nIn its reaction, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate strong courage and leadership by prevailing on his party to zone the 2023 presidency to the South-east.\n\n\n\nSpeaking through its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the organisation said those who came up with the issue of dividing the country along zonal structures were not wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome patriots tried to create six zones for the country and this was done to ensure equity, justice and fairness. That singular action has helped to stabilise the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the same wisdom that made President Olusegun Obasanjo to ensure the emergence of a northerner in 2007 even when the odds strongly favoured the then Governor Peter Odili. Since then, power has been moving from North to South.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis time around, Buhari has to decide and ensure that nothing truncates this process to maintain peace, unity and corporate existence of Nigeria. As the leader of the country and the leader of the APC, President Buhari must demonstrate strong courage by ensuring that power is moved to South-east after him,\u201d the organisation noted.\n\n\n\nThe organisation, however, warned that anything outside zoning the presidency to the South-east zone would not only boomerang but threaten the nation\u2019s very existence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe way APC prevaricates over this issue of zoning is troubling. We however believe that the onus lies on the president; but if he chooses to play the ostrich, he should also bear in mind that history will not be kind to him. He must sail this ship to safe harbour.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf they fail to do the needful, let them bear in mind that restiveness, insecurity and cries of marginalisation will never cease and those championing such will be right. The President must write his name in gold by doing the right thing,\u201d Ogbonnia explained.\n\nI will Support Whoever is Buhari, APC\u2019s Choice, Says Amaechi\n\nIn another development, the Minister of Transportation, Amaechi, yesterday said he would support President Buhari and APC\u2019s chosen candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nAmaechi expressed his loyalty to President Buhari and the APC.\n\nAmaechi, in a statement, said this at a consultative meeting with executives, delegates and another party faithful at the Rivers APC Secretariat at the weekend.\n\n\n\nThe minister indicated that in his bid to become the President of Nigeria, which he is thoroughly qualified for, he was neither desperate nor disloyal.\n\n\n\nThe two terms governor of Rivers said it was sad that many politicians do not understand the concept of loyalty.\n\n\u201cLoyalty is not when you are not chosen, you become disloyal, loyalty means you follow the man that leads you, that you have surrendered to his leadership.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t follow, it means you are not loyal, you are only benefitting from the man politically and economically. The day he\u2019s not able to give you that economic reality, is the day you become disloyal.\n\n\u201cI am a very loyal person, and those who are disloyal, I wish them well, those who want to do whatever they want to do, I wish them well,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the opportunity will be given to everybody and all will run in this presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe will run and I am loyal to the President and I am loyal to the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the party says it is me, thank God. If the party says it is not me, whoever the party chooses, I will support it.\n\n\u201cIf the party and President choose anybody, I will support the person, if the party chooses me, I will be glad and say thank God,\u201d Amaechi explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had, just before the party\u2019s National Convention, said even though the APC had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nResponding to the issue of when political appointees who intend to contest in the election are expected to resign, especially in the light of the party\u2019s recently issued guidelines for people in that category, Adamu declined comment, saying \u201cthe matter is currently in court.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cOur luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it will be subjudice for me to discuss it at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the cost of the party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, which many considered rather high, the Chairman said the party had no regret setting the prices at the current rate, citing the need to protect the party from unserious aspirants, moles, as well as the need to generate money to run the election processes.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through presidential campaigns, go through election for the President. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contest, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheap by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, they will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from. If, God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million, it\u2019s no news.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression (of interest). When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it cost him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue begging.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election. Some protests may be well founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume \u2018it\u2019s the ruling party\u2019, is quick\u2026 in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI will not quarrel with that, everyone of us has the right to express himself, and I\u2019m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where it pinches us the most.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn reports that the process of settling for a presidential candidate could tear the party apart, if not carefully handled, Adamu said: \u201cGod will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out, by the grace of God, at the appropriate time, our great party will choose the candidate at the convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not want to speculate, but my duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes and I\u2019ve always found it easier and more noble to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not there yet.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s Presidential Aspirants Lengthen to 13\n\n\n\nThe number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC jumped to 13 yesterday as the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, sent out a notice that he would formally declare for president next Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nFayemi joins a long list that includes Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu; ex-governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former president of the Senate, Ken Nnamani; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nFive of the presidential aspirants have so far paid N100 million and picked up their forms. Those who did were Tinubu, Umahi, Bello, Nwajiuba and Okorocha.\n\n\n\nNnamani, while declaring his intention to run for president yesterday, promised to improve on the legacy of President Buhari, while also demanding for the reduction of the cost of interest and nomination forms for aspirants seeking elective posts under the APC.\n\n\n\nHe said compared with other aspirants, he was the most suited for the job of the President.\n\nNnamani said his pedigree as the President of the Senate and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Constitutional and Electoral Reform make him the right candidate.\n\n\n\nOkorocha picked his presidential expression of interest and nomination forms yesterday, insisting that Nigeria\u2019s biggest challenge remains the inability to create wealth.\n\nOkorocha, who was presented the documents by \u201cThe New Nigeria Team\u201d, in his Unity House office in Abuja, maintained that he remained the right candidate to take over from Buhari, promising that his government would be pro-people.\n\nTinubu Support Groups (TSG) yesterday picked the N100 million Expression of Interest and nomination forms on behalf of Tinubu.\n\n\n\nThe TSG team was led by a member representing Ikeja Federal constituency in the House of Representatives and the Chairman House Committee on Finance, Hon. James Faleke.\n\nFaleke said Tinubu paid for his form personally but asked them to pick it up on his behalf because he was out of the country.\n\nThe lawmaker stressed that Tinubu was the candidate to beat, no matter the mode of primaries adopted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\n\u201cAsiwaju at the appropriate time will deliver his address to us, but I know that this country under Tinubu will be better off. Economy will be better off because he is an economist, he is not a lawyer, he is an economist. He will deal with the economic situation of this country. He did it in Lagos, the security challenges in Lagos were solved by him. He will solve the same security challenges. He is a man who rewards loyalty, who ensures that people who work are also taken care of.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal said Tinubu is a branded product, adding that every Nigerian knows that he is the man to beat.\n\n\n\nOn his chances, he noted, \u201cIf we were not sure we have chances to win this election we would not waste our N100 million. Everybody\u2019s free to buy the forms if he has N100 million. The choice is his own. He has the money. But as far as we are concerned, we are only fulfilling the constitutional requirement of campaigning and going for election.

The exercise was held in Lagos and delegates chose him to fly the party\u2019s flag.\n\nBuhari polled 3,430 votes to defeat Rabiu Kwankwaso, former Kano governor; Atiku, Rochas Okorocha, former Imo governor; and the late Sam Nda-Isaiah, publisher of Leadership Newspaper.\n\nBut upon seeking re-election in 2019, the party used direct primary to affirm Buhari as the party\u2019s candidate. All party members interested in the process voted directly to affirm Buhari as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe PDP chose Atiku as its presidential candidate in 2019 using the indirect primary mode.\n\nHe polled 1,532 votes to defeat the likes of Tambuwal, Saraki, Jonah Jang, former Plateau governor, and David Mark, former president of the senate.\n\nIn the forthcoming elections, the two main parties are going to pick their presidential candidates using the indirect primary method and delegates are the ultimate deciders.\n\nPresidential hopefuls of the various parties have been visiting the state chapters of their political parties to woo them.\n\n\n\nHOW DELEGATES ARE PICKED\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are two types of delegates \u2014 the ad hoc and the statutory.\n\nThe ad hoc delegates are picked by holding congresses in the wards across the country. The process involves party members choosing people who will vote on their behalf in the party\u2019s governorship or presidential primary election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the PDP is currently holding its congresses across the country to choose its ad hoc delegates, the APC will begin that process on May 7.\n\nBreakdown of APC delegates by states#TheCableIndex pic.twitter.com/9qlHtNYOCI Advertisement \u2014 TheCableIndex (@thecableindex) April 19, 2022\n\nThe national executive committees (NECs) \u2014 highest organ \u2014 of political parties are to determine the mode for which these congresses are to be held.\n\nAfter the delegates are selected, a convention will be held to enable them to decide on who will fly the party\u2019s gubernatorial or presidential flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the statutory delegates \u2014 also known as automatic delegates \u2014 are those party members who have held public office before.\n\nThey include former presidents, governors, deputy governors, former national and state house of assembly members.\n\nAlso, party members who currently hold the aforementioned positions are eligible to vote to pick candidates at the conventions of the political parties.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

This was on my mind during the weekend. Initially, I had this great idea to buy pizza and continue the series I started about a month ago. Unfortunately, my health refused to cooperate.\n\nYou can\u2019t deny that your overall health is crucial. Besides, rest is essential no matter how much you love to work. Well, today is another holiday. Enjoy it by resting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRest is essential for enhanced mental health, increased focus and memory, a stronger immune system, decreased stress, improved mood, and even a faster metabolism.\n\nConsequently, by resting today, you are protecting your overall health. I genuinely care about you and wish you a restful week ahead. But if you don\u2019t rest, my care will be for nothing. Please promise me you\u2019ll rest today.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nNALA\u2019s partnership with Cellulant\n\nMicrosoft Edge\u2019s free built-in VPN\n\nHow to remove personal information from Google Search\n\nNALA partners with Cellulant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNALA, a Tanzanian cross-border payments company, has partnered with Cellulant, a Kenyan payments company, to facilitate remittance payments from the UK and US into Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ghana.\n\nWhat exactly does this imply? Cellulant and NALA\u2019s partnership will promote seamless cross-border payments and cut the cost of sending money from the UK and the US into Africa.\n\nRecall that in 2019, Africa received around $48 billion in remittances, with Nigeria getting roughly half of this amount, followed by Ghana and Kenya. But transaction costs consume a significant portion of the billions sent to Africa each year.\n\nSending money into Africa has the highest expense of any region. Tanzania and Kenya continue to be the most expensive, with costs of 17% and 21% for every $200 transferred, respectively.\n\nWith rising intra-African trade and trade between Africa and the rest of the globe, one of the challenges to success in facilitating cross-border payments is transaction cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does NALA do? NALA, which was founded in 2018 by Benjamin Fernandes (CEO and Founder), enables cross-border payments from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union to Africa.\n\nWhat about Cellulant? Cellulant was launched in 2002 as a music streaming platform that allowed musicians to earn a percentage of the money fans paid to download their tracks.\n\nThe music streaming platform was then rebranded as a fintech company, delivering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners over time.\n\nWhy did Cellulant partner with Cellulant? Per NALA\u2019s COO, Nicolai Eddy, \u201cCellulant is one of the early payment pioneers on the continent, and we chose to partner with them because of their deep expertise in the space and their strong technical capabilities.\u201d\n\nCellulant has offices in 18 countries and a payments platform connecting thousands of businesses with 257 payment choices in 35 countries. The platform facilitates payments for 200 million customers on a single inclusive network, allowing interoperability across Africa.\n\nOn the other hand, NALA is currently present in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Ghana and plans to expand into Nigeria and Ethiopia. The company plans to spread its services throughout Africa, the United States, and Canada.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show you the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your tickets here.\n\nMicrosoft Edge\u2019s free built-in VPN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is your preferred web browser? Google Chrome? Microsoft Edge? Internet Explorer (IE)? Haha! What century do you live in if you use IE?\n\nAnyway, if you still use IE, start preparing for its demise because Microsoft announced in May 2021 that it would be phased out on June 15, 2022.\n\nBesides, keep in mind that as IE\u2019s market share was steadily declining \u2014 Google Chrome dominates other browsers with a 69% market share \u2014Microsoft was developing Microsoft Edge to replace Internet Explorer.\n\nI guess now it\u2019s a good time to revisit this: Why some Nigerians might not miss Internet Explorer but would use Microsoft Edge\n\nWith IE about to give up the ghost, Microsoft announced that it is adding a free built-in virtual private network (VPN) service to its Edge browser to boost security and privacy.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft is testing the Cloudflare-powered VPN service, called \u201cEdge Secure Network,\u201d and claims it will make it available to the public as part of a security upgrade.\n\nWhen enabled, Edge Secure Network should encrypt users\u2019 online traffic, preventing internet service providers from collecting browsing information you\u2019d rather keep secret, like health-related searches or weird questions.\ud83d\ude09\n\nThe new function will also allow users to conceal their location by browsing the web using a virtual IP address. This also means that users will be able to access content that is restricted in their own countries, like Netflix shows.\n\nBut there is a catch: Data consumption is limited to 1GB each month, and users must have a Microsoft account so the company can track their usage.\n\nAlso, the feature is still under development and not yet accessible for early testing.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Now, you can ask Google to avoid showing specific URLs that point to information that could lead someone to your house or give them access to your accounts.\n\nWhy? This is to prevent the exploitation of private information, particularly in cases of financial fraud and doxxing \u2014 contact information shared with malicious, threatening, or harassing intent.\n\nAlso, Google will remove things like \u201cnon-consensual explicit or intimate personal images,\u201d pornographic deepfakes or Photoshops featuring your likeness, or links to sites with \u201cexploitative removal practices.\u201d\n\nHow do you make a removal request? Go to the topic\u2019s support page, scroll halfway down, and click the blue \u201cStart removal request\u201d button.\n\nFirst off, you\u2019ll be asked if you have contacted the website\u2019s proprietors. This is not required, so select \u201cNo, I prefer not to.\u201d When Google asks what you want to delete, for example, choose \u201cPersonal info, like ID numbers and private documents.\u201d\n\nThen you can specify what type of personal information is showing up in Google Search, like your contact details or driver\u2019s license. The second question asks if the request is related to doxxing.\n\nFollowing that, Google asks for your full name, country of residence, and email address. Takedown requests may only be submitted for results belonging to yourself or someone you formally represent.\n\nAttach a screenshot to your request that shows where your personal information appears on the web page. You will be asked to list relevant search terms at the end of the form, like your complete name and maiden name.\n\nBefore completing and submitting the removal request, you are allowed to provide further information. After you submit, Google will give you an automated email confirmation.\n\nWhen it receives removal requests, it will review all content on the web page to ensure that it is not interfering with the availability of other information that is widely helpful, like news items.\n\nThe search giant will also check to determine if the content is part of the public record on the websites of government or official sources. In such cases, they will not remove it.\n\nPlease take note: Removing content from Google Search does not remove it off the Internet, so you may want to contact the hosting site directly if you\u2019re comfortable doing so.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n\u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nMaking sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nHow a search for infinite learning led Justin Irabor to the world of computer science\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, I watched The Smart Money Woman, and I believe there are many Zuris out there, regardless of gender, race, religion, or employment.\n\nFirst off, who is Zuri? The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate. Since its launch, Eden Life has provided over 150,000 services in Nigeria.\n\nNadayar Enegesi, Prosper Otemuyiwa, and Silm Momoh co-founded the company in Nigeria in 2019. It connects busy professionals with concierge services, and a subscription service that delivers high-quality chef-prepared meals, laundry services, and house cleaning.\n\nComing in with a twist: Unlike Lagos, Nairobi users get an additional service: a beauty and wellness service.\n\nWhat you should know about Lynk: The platform was launched in 2015, and it facilitated over 150,000 jobs, transferring $4.5 million to over 2,000 workers across four major verticals: beauty & wellness, cleaning & care, installation, repair & maintenance, and furniture & decor.\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePort 365, an African digital freight forwarding company, has raised $5 million in seed funding to drive end-to-end digitisation of freight management in Africa and support its expansion into new markets.\n\nLed by Mobility 54 \u2014 VC arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group \u2014 SBI Investment, Flexport, ODX, a Singaporean syndicate fund, Samurai Incubate, and other angel investors participated.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do? Launched in 2019 by Hio Sola-Usidame (CEO), the platform covers air freight, ocean freight, inland haulage (trucking, barge, and rail), and Pay-As-You-Go warehousing, marine insurance, customs brokerage, and more.\n\nCurrently, OnePort 365 is creating an operating system for African cross-border trade, assisting traders in managing their freight processes via a digital platform that enables seamless freight forwarding and other value-added services.\n\nAccording to OnePort 365, traders no longer have to wait up to two weeks to compare the best rates from various service providers. They can explore competitive offers on the platform and book freights in 30 seconds or less using pre-negotiated rates.\n\nIt currently operates in Nigeria and Ghana, and is exploring other markets. The platform also makes use of advancements in payment technology and the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to enable instant payments.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve efficiency and lower overheads in cross-border trading across the continent, and to launch several new services that will boost overall profitability.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

Pioneering borderless payment, using the blockchain and bypassing gatekeepers through the use of the blockchain. DeFi has moved from being a cryptocurrency thing to being a real contender and an example of what banking can be.\n\nSince Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is based on secure distributed ledgers which is akin to the systems used by cryptocurrencies, it can bypass Central Banks and other institutions that serve as barriers in the traditional banking system. There are a lot of entrants into the DeFi space, including tokens like Ripple and Fantom, these tokens were some of DeFi\u2019s frontrunners, however, DeFi is getting re-DeFi\u2019ned. Logarithmic Finance is set to become a big name.\n\nRipple (XRP)\n\nComing into the cryptocurrency space in the year 2013, Ripple (XRP) had the advantage of early entry. It fell quickly into contention and rose into the top ten of all cryptocurrencies in the world by the end of the year. It has since then gone on to make great gains, however, a few shadows follow Ripple (XRP). The organisation behind it was locked in a legal stalemate for the better part of 2021, the class action filed in December of 2020 stagnated the all-time high of Ripple at $3.84.\n\nFantom (FTM)\n\nFantom is another of DeFi\u2019s hot tokens, at $1.07 per token, Fantom (FTM) is outside of the crypto top 10 by the ranking of Market Capitalization. Fantom (FTM) uses the proof of stake method of validation and it has been stated by some as the most suitable replacement for Ethereum (ETH). This is a high goal that it is yet to live up to despite having spent ample time in the market.\n\nThe light, scalable nature of Fantom (FTM) makes it a token to reckon with. This token is quite established now. Perhaps its time for a fresh face, Logarithmic Finance.\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG)\n\nLogarithmic Finance (LOG) comes packed with promise. It is a layer-3 switching protocol that intends to deliver the moving of financial assets at ease across borders, blockchains and languages. Logarithmic Finance (LOG) will boast a cross and multichain system that will allow financial assets to be generated and moved across any major blockchain network that will include the Ethereum (ETH), BNB Chain, Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystems.\n\nThis singular use case, when implemented will be a potential winning principal that will push Logarithmic Finance to the forefront of DeFi. At the moment, the code of the project is in the works and is being reviewed independently by Certik. Logarithmic Finance (LOG) is also interoperable and open source, with a public-driven and highly spirited drive towards overall development, the coin has a lot of potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mass adoption from the prelaunch state means that there should be enough investors holding the coin by the time it goes public. This will drive appeal, access and use cases as others will be willing to use it too. This could circumnavigate the issues that Fantom (FTM) is currently facing.\n\nWith all of these promises, it is an absolute steal to have Logarithmic Finance (LOG) at a locked presale of $0.10. The potential truth is that at no other time will the Logarithmic Finance (LOG) cryptocurrency be cheaper than it is today. Everything is in place, DeFi is going to see a massive shift and Logarithmic Finance (LOG) looks like it could be the centre of it.\n\nFor more information, follow these accounts:\n\nPresale: https://presale.logarithmic.finance/register\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/LOGARITHMIC_FINANCE_OFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LOGARITHMIC_FI\n\nWebsite: https://LOGarithmic.finance/\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/logarithmic_finance?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey? Sign up for bekonta\n\nnow and enjoy the cheapest rates when you buy BTC, USDT, BNB, ETH, TRX,\n\nand more!\n\nAbout Bekonta\n\nBekonta is an automated platform that enables you to Buy, Sell or Store\n\nyour Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX), Binance Coin (BNB), and\n\nMore securely.

          "text": "Nigeria has an opportunity to profit from Europe\u2019s plan to pull the plug on the importation of Russian gas in the wake of Moscow\u2019s war with Ukraine.\n\nThe International Energy Association (IEA), the Paris-based think tank that draws up energy polices for Western countries, has published a 10-point plan that would help Europe cut its dependence on Russian gas and this could open new markets for Nigeria and other gas producers.\n\nIn 2021, the European Union (EU) imported 45 percent of gas from Russia and this represents almost 40 percent of its total gas consumption. Its backing of Ukraine in the war against Russia is opening fissures other producers can exploit.\n\nThe IEA, in its 10-point plan, proposes a series of immediate actions that could be taken to reduce reliance on Russian gas, including non-renewal of gas supply contracts with Russian firms, replacing Russian supplies with other alternative sources, and introducing minimum gas storage obligations to improve market resilience.\n\n10-point plan\n\nThe IEA says gas import contracts with Gazprom covering more than 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year are set to expire by the end of 2022, equating to around 12 percent of the company\u2019s gas supplies to the EU in 2021. Overall, contracts with Gazprom covering close to 40 bcm per year are due to expire by 2030.\n\n\u201cThis provides the EU with a clear near-term window of opportunity to significantly diversify its gas supplies and contracts towards other sources, leveraging the options for imports provided by its large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and pipeline infrastructure,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nDuring a recent webinar organised by the African Energy Chamber (AEC), the panellists discussed how Africa can emerge as the preferred supplier to European markets in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\n\u201cAfrica has the money to build its own infrastructure; it is getting half a billion US dollars by selling oil and gas per day,\u201d said Leoncio Amada Nze Nlang, president of the AEC. \u201cWe just need to direct that money towards infrastructure development.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Africa also needs to improve its taxes on energy to attract investments and to avoid majors exiting the market, according to Nlang, who added that \u201cChevron and other big firms are leaving the West African market because fiscal terms are not making sense; there are high taxes.\u201d\n\nThis could open up new markets for Nigeria\u2019s 206 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves valued at over $803.4 trillion, but the country must fix challenges including pipeline vandalism and access to financing.\n\nThe IEA forecasts that production inside the EU and non-Russian pipeline imports (including from Azerbaijan and Norway) could increase over the next year by up to 10 bcm from 2021.\n\nIt believes it can replace around 30 bcm in additional gas supply from non-Russian sources through a ramp-up of its LNG imports, considering its ample access to spare regasification capacity.\n\n\u201cThe LNG trade is inherently flexible; so the crucial variables for the near-term are the availability of additional cargoes, especially those that have some contractual leeway over the destination, and competition for this supply with other importers, notably in Asia,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s best hope of meeting an LNG gap in Europe is the Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG), which is currently struggling to keep its supply going amid a wave of pipeline attacks.\n\n\u201cThe escalating pipeline vandalism is affecting every pipeline including the ones transporting associated gas, which is bad business for NLNG and other companies in the gas business,\u201d said Niyi Awodeyi, CEO of Subterra Energy Resources Limited, a firm exposed to Nigeria\u2019s gas market.\n\nItalian oil major, Eni, recently said an attack on its 24-inch gas line at Okaka in Yenagoa forced it to declare a force majeure at NLNG in Bonny.\n\nOther measures advocated by the IEA go towards cutting down consumption storage and enhancing market resilience.\n\nThe IEA is betting on a harmonised approach to minimum storage obligations for commercial operators in the EU\u2019s single gas market, together with robust market-based capacity allocation mechanisms, to ensure the optimal use of all available storage capacity in the EU.\n\nAnother strategy under consideration by the IEA is to accelerate the deployment of new wind and solar projects. It projects an additional 35TWh of generation from new renewable projects over the next year, over and above the already anticipated growth from these sources, bringing down gas use by 6 bcm.\n\nRead also: Drive less, work from home to avoid crippling oil crunch \u2014 IEA\n\nThe IEA is counting on maximising generation from existing dispatchable low-emissions sources, including bioenergy and nuclear. The large fleet of bioenergy power plants in the EU operated at about 50 percent of its total capacity in 2021 but they could generate up to 50TWh more electricity in 2022, if appropriate incentives and sustainable supplies of bioenergy are put in place. This, the IEA hopes, will add 70TWh of power generation from existing dispatchable low emissions sources, reducing gas use for electricity by 13 bcm.\n\nThe IEA is also urging member countries to enact short-term measures to shelter vulnerable electricity consumers from high prices. It is calling for temporary tax measures to raise rates on electricity companies\u2019 windfall profits and tax receipts redistributed to electricity consumers to partially offset higher energy bills. It hopes this will bring down energy bills for consumers even when natural gas prices remain high, making available up to EUR 200 billion to cushion impacts on vulnerable groups.\n\nAnother practical measure offered by the IEA is to speed up the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps.\n\n\u201cHeat pumps offer a very efficient and cost-effective way to heat homes, replacing boilers that use gas or other fossil fuels. Speeding up anticipated deployment by doubling current EU installation rates of heat pumps would save an additional 2 bcm of gas use within the first year, requiring a total additional investment of EUR 15 billion,\u201d the IEA said.\n\nOther measures promoted by the IEA include accelerating energy efficiency improvements in buildings and industry, encouraging a temporary thermostat adjustment by consumers and stepping up efforts to diversify and decarbonise sources of power system flexibility.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026Approves payment of harmonized pension from May 2022\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has approved #40,000 as the new minimum wage for workers in the state, in commemoration of this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nThe governor, who made the announcement while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 day speech, said his government will continue to prioritize the welfare of Edo workers, equipping them with the capacity and environment to deliver efficient and quality service to the people.\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend that we do not know that our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000 a month. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government.\n\n\u201cBut as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nReassuring his government\u2019s relentless support to senior citizens in the state, Obaseki lamented the hardship experienced by pensioners and other senior citizens as a result of rising cost of food and other items.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am particularly interested in our senior citizens because they are one of the most vulnerable in our society. We took interest in payments of outstanding pensions to our pensioners in spite of the fact that these pensions were held by the previous administration.\n\n\u201cIn view of the prevailing economic circumstances, I have now approved, effective this May, the agreement we reached with the Union of Pensioners that the harmonized amount would be paid from May 2022.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by the pensioners due to the non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges,\u201d the governor added.\n\nObaseki however urged workers in the state to take advantage of opportunities offered by his administration in the agricultural sector to increase food production in the country.\n\nEarlier in his address, the state Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye, charged the federal government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment and hunger in the country.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Scandals: Gov. Abiodun faces renewed second term hurdles",
          "text": "Olusesan Laoye\n\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State is now enmeshed in a fresh scandal, which could mar his second term bid, barely four years after he scaled through the first one in 2019 over qualification scandal, when he was contesting the election which he won under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nIn 2019 when he filed a nomination form for the governorship, he was accused of having claimed to have obtained a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Accountancy from the University of Ife, now Obafemi Awolowo University Ile Ife. Those who filed the petition against him then, claimed that the University does not offer BA in Accountancy\n\nAlthough the issue went to court, he eventually won the election and became the governor. Those behind the first allegations appear not to have been done with him, as they came up with a fresh one this time around that he was a convict in the United States of America over fraud, which is now generating more heat and controversies than he and his supporters could imagine.\n\nIn the petition calling for his disqualification in his second term bid, one Ayodele Oludiran, an APC member wrote the National Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu that Governor Dapo Abiodun is not fit to contest the primary for the governorship.\n\nAyodele Oludiran on behalf of Oluwatobi Sofela of Ogun Bibire Unity Forum hinted the National Chairman of the party, and had warned that the party might lose the governorship seat in Ogun due to Abioduns criminal history and its concealment from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) despite swearing an oath.\n\nHe also cautioned that the discrepancies in the governors educational qualifications might also cause opposition parties to question his eligibility for re-election bid, and that could damage the party\u2019s image and convince the electorate to vote another political party.\n\nHe wrote \u201cIf action is not taken, the chances of our great party, the APC, retaining the governorship seat in Ogun State shall be in jeopardy as previously seen in Bayelsa and Zamfara states,\n\nAs Governor Abiodun defended himself in the certificate and educational Institution issues in 2015, he is doing the same now, calling on the National body of the party to dismiss the current allegations against him. Though he admitted being arrested in 1986 in Florida for credit card fraud as alleged, he claimed not being convicted.\n\nAbiodun said that his probable arrest was not a conviction and hence was not answerable to the laws that applied to criminals.\n\nHe added that even if he was convicted in 1986, the Nigerian constitution only disqualifies ex-felons from contesting political offices if their sentence was less than 10 years before the election date.\n\nAn aspirant or candidate will only be disqualified by the court if the false information he gives relates to a constitutional requirement of eligibility. APC is not a court of law. Accordingly, it cannot disqualify our client, the governors lawyer, Afe Babalola wrote in a letter to Adamu, citing section 29(6) of the Electoral Act.\n\nIn any event, assuming but not conceding that our client was even convicted in 1986, he would still not be affected or caught by Section 182 (1) (e) of the CFRN because the CFRN requires that the conviction which would disqualify a person from the position of the governor must have occurred ten years before the date of election to the office.\n\nThe alleged criminal records of the governor now circulation and which has been generating heat a cross Nigerian indicated how one Dapo Abiodun was allegedly jailed in 1986 for credit card fraud in Miami Dade Florida, USA.\n\nThe governor was said to have used a pseudo name (Shawn Michael Davids) with the aim of concealing his criminal identity. The record further indicated that Abiodun was jailed for committing criminal offences which bordered on credit card fraud, petty theft and check forgery.\n\nHe was also allegedly arrested on November 7, 1986, for fighting and injuring a police officer in an attempt to resist arrest.\n\nThe records as revealed indicated as well that while being processed at the station, they ran his fingerprint through the crime database and it was discovered he deceived the authorities as it was found out that Adedapo Oluseun Abiodun being processed for detention, was the same as Shawn Michael Davids.\n\nThe petitioner claimed that the governor\u2019s criminal record and history were therefore processed and he was subsequently jailed with Number 8600B9436\n\nIt was said that the criminal allegations against the governor have been on for a long time in Nigeria as it was alleged also that in 2015, while contesting for the Ogun East Senatorial seat against the late Buruji Kasamu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he Kasamu, applied for the redaction of his criminal records in Miami Dade, Florida.\n\nIt was further said that the redaction of his criminal records was discovered then, to have meant that the act of concealment by the governor could have meant he could lie on his Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) forms that he had no prior criminal records; a perjury offence which could have disqualified him from ever holding an appointive or elective office in Nigeria.\n\nSince all these revelations were made about Governor Abiodun which were also not let out of the bag in 2019, when he was contesting, Business Hallmark investigations revealed that palpable fear has gripped the camp of the governor and efforts are being made to appease those behind the scenes instigating what has been described as mudslinging.\n\nIt was said that notable and powerful members and leaders of the party in Ogun State have been making consultations here and there.\n\nSources hinted BusinessHallmark that despite the move to reconcile and call those involved to order, they were hell bent on seeing their petition to a logical conclusion and vowed to prevent Abiodu\u2019s second chance.\n\nBut those in the governor\u2019s camp including the governor himself, it was learnt have started mapping out strategies to prove that the allegations were not true and unfounded.\n\nIn the letter received at the National Secretariat of the APC by Amb. Samuel Jimba, the law chamber said that the petitions were not served on the governor, which according to it was a deliberate move to deprive him of the opportunity to set the records straight and knowing full well that the petition was characterized by falsehood and malice.\n\nWhile noting that the petitions are nothing more than the machinations of political jobbers and saboteurs sponsored by desperate opposition elements to disrupt the peaceful political atmosphere in Ogun, spread rumours/propaganda about the governor and mislead the APC, said the petitioner relied on hearsays, urging Senator Adamu and national leadership of the APC to disregard the hearsays.\n\nAccording to Afe Babalola & Co, \u201cthe allegation of discrepancies in Governor Abioduns INEC Form CF001 for 2015 and 2019, is statute-barred, arguing that the allegation can only form the basis of a cause of action in court 14 days from the day the governor filed and deposed to it.\n\nIt further stated that the alleged contradiction in the two INEC Forms cannot longer be a ground to disqualify Governor Abiodun in the upcoming 2023 gubernatorial election, as Forms CF001 for 2015 and 2019 are spent and cannot be used to determine the eligibility of the governor to contest in the next governorship election.\n\nThe law firm recalled that court cases were filed in court and petitions filed at the Governorship Election Tribunal seeking to disqualify the governor based on allegations of falsehood and inconsistency in the two INEC Forms, saying that both the Tribunal and courts were unanimous in their decisions not only that the allegations were status-barred, but held that the said Forms CF001 of 2015 and 2019 did not contain any false statement.\n\nIt further said 4that the Supreme Court of Nigeria had also affirmed the decisions of the Tribunal and the Appeal Court, by dismissing the petition of false statement against the governor.\n\nOn the allegation that the governor had been convicted for an offence in 1986, the chamber said the petitioner failed to attach any court judgment to the petition to this effect, hence, the allegation was baseless, asking the APC top echelon to discountenance as such.\n\nThe firm also denied the allegation in the petition that the governor has a former name, declaring that the governor has always been known as Prince Adedapo Oluseun Abiodun, adding that he never bore the name Shawn Michael Davis or any other name however described\u201d.\n\nHis name is reflected in all his certificates and other former documents. We urge Your Excellency to disregard the petitioners unfounded allegation, it pointed out.\n\nOur client has been adjudged by the Tribunal and courts to be eminently qualified to contest the 2019 Ogun State gubernatorial election, which he won landslide.\n\nSince, as of today, the courts have held that our client is qualified under CFRN, the party cannot impose additional grounds for disqualification on him. Also, the APC Constitution and Guidelines for the conduct of primary elections cannot override the CFRN. Therefore, the party has no vires to prevent our client from contesting any election under its banner.\n\nAs rightly admitted by the petitioner, only a court of law can disqualify our client. The party cannot disqualify him or prevent him from contesting in the partys primary election.\n\nIn Abiodun\u2019s defense, former member of the House of Representatives, Kayode Oladele, reacted to the petition against Governor Abiodun of Ogun State, saying arrest is not a conviction.\n\nMr. Oladele, who represented Egbado North/ Imeko Afon Federal Constituency in the eighth Assembly, condemned the petition, which alleged that Mr. Abiodun concealed his criminal records in the United States of America.\n\nMr. Oladele, a human rights and constitutional lawyer, said the petition lacks content and form.",

          "title": "2023: North dares the South on Presidency",
          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nAs the 2023 presidential election draws near, some powerful elements within the Northern political establishment are back to the drawing board with a view to upsetting the settled political apple cart in respect of the new political norm which prescribes rotational presidency as a panacea to the unhealthy political rivalry between the North and South.\n\nIt was this gentleman kind of agreement that brought Musa Yar\u2019adua in 2007, and same went for Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 on the platform of APC..\n\nThe understanding is that in 2023, the South will produce the president, but this convenient arrangement which has brought some stability to the system is about to suffer some setback which consequences no one can fathom. Competence sources in the North confided in Business Hallmark that some powerful politicians are not comfortable with power returning to the South again, and are strategizing on how to perfect their subterfuge and ensure the North retains power.\n\nSources say the North are working on propping up the opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party for the political battle ahead, already, secret meetings have allegedly been held by Northern politicians across political divides on how to use the PDP to maintain their stranglehold on power.\n\nAn indication of this emerged last week, when the Chairman of All Progressive Congress, APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, after a meeting with President Buhari declared that the party has not zoned the presidency to any part of the country, which seems completely contrary to perceived existing protocol given the multiplicity of legacy parties the formed APC, and the fact that the Chairman is from the north, as we also have in the PDP.\n\nEarly on, political heavyweights like Abubakar Atiku, Bukola Saraki, Ibrahim Tambuwal, Sule Lamido and Bala Mohammed, all top Northern politicians have indicated interest in contesting for president in 2023. They have consistently made mincemeat of the rotation rhetoric, saying what Nigeria needs now is competence to rescue the country from the abyss the ruling All Progressives Congress has taken the country.\n\nLending credence to the resolve of the North to hold on to power in a daring move to spite the South, Professor Ango Abdullahi, former vice chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, and an influential chair of the Northern Elders Forum, said the North has pencilled down two names as consensus candidates, these are Bukola Saraki, former Senate President; and Bala Mohammed; current governor of Bauchi State.\n\nThis announcement seemed to have sparkled infighting in their fold as other politicians from the region interested in contesting for president have reacted furiously to Abdullahi\u2019s, adding that the consensus affairs was a sham.\n\nLeaders of the PDP in the 19 northern states and the FCT have denied endorsing any aspirant as the partys preferred candidate for 2023 presidential election. The leaders said this in a communiqu\u00e9 at the end of their meeting in Abuja last Monday\n\nThe communique was read by former Jigawa State governor, Sule Lamido.\n\nThe former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State were alleged to have been shortlisted by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) as the preferred candidates among four northern aspirants seeking for consensus candidate for the PDP.\n\nMessrs Tambuwal and Hayatu-Deen have since rejected the choice.\n\nMr. Lamido said that the PDP presidential candidate would emerge from the partys national convention slated to hold from May 28 to May 29.\n\nWe will like to state from the onset that there is nothing called the northern PDP.\n\nOur coming together as key stakeholders from the northern states is only for the purpose of debunking any notion or impression which might have been created by Prof. Ango Abdullahis statement about the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) having shortlisted consensus PDP presidential candidates.\n\nThe PDP as conceived by its founding fathers is and remains the foremost national political platform wherein the democratic aspirations of its teeming members can be actualised devoid of any sectional consideration.\n\nOur party is neither northern nor southern, but Nigeria, he said.\n\nMr. Lamido said that the stakeholders were happy that the NEF had through its secretary, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, disassociated itself from Angos statement.\n\nThey made it clear that it is Angos personal opinion.\n\nThe aspirants have informed us that they are discussing among themselves. They are consulting other senior citizens in order to create a better understanding and unity among themselves.\n\nTheir ultimate objective is to build a national consensus that will produce a national candidate for the party. We urge them to keep up with this commendable effort, he said.\n\nKnowledgeable sources familiar with the plot informed BusinessHallmark that APC Northern Caucus are also working in tandem with the plot, since the party seems to be toeing the rotational agreement in the public, as only Southern candidates have so far emerged in the party to contest for the position of president.\n\nIt was learnt that secretly the two parties are plotting to ensure support for whoever emerges as presidential candidate from the North to defeat whoever emerges from the South as presidential candidate of the APC .\n\nBusinessHallmark learnt that the plotters who insist power must stay in the North at all cost are also considering different scenarios, one of which is to draft a pliable Southern who will be a puppet with the North pulling string behind the scenes.\n\nThe idea of drafting the vice president Yemi Osinbajo is said to be a product of this thinking. it was learnt that they are also working on alternative to Osinbajo given that the later has no solid political structure to counter Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a man they fear to see emerge as president according to sources.\n\nThe third force in their calculation, is the former president, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The arrowheads of the Jonathan opposition of doing one term of four years before handing over to his Northern vice president are said to be Mai Mala Buni, Yobe State governor and Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State. Recall that the duo had earlier late last year led a delegation to Otueke to convince Jonathan to join APC.\n\nThe Jonathan option may have been a stillborn as powerful forces have risen up against it, and last Friday, a legal luminary and foremost human rights activist, Femi Falana said the 1999 Constitution does not give room for a Jonathan comeback.\n\nThe South seems prepared for this subterfuge, as Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike has made it clear that it is the turn of the South to produce the president, and to drive home his point that he means business he has been touring Northern States where he has made it clear that the South would resist the temptations to shift the goalpost midway into the game.\n\nAlready, the Afenifere under the leadership of Ayo Adebanjo has said for the sake of equity the Southeast should be allowed to produce the next president. There has been surfeit of candidates from the Southeast who have indicated interest to run for president in the two parties; even the Middle Belt has said the region would resist any attempt by any of the political parties to field a Northern candidate for president.\n\nThe Middle-Belt Youth Council Worldwide has reiterated that the next president of the country must come from the South. It also warned the major political parties in the country, not to field a presidential candidate from the North, saying that such a flag bearer would lose the 2023 general election because he would not enjoy the support of the youths in the Federal Capital Territory and the 14 States that make up the Middle-Belt.\n\nThe President of the Middle-Belt Youth Council, Mr. Emmanuel Zopmal, gave the warning while briefing journalists in Abuja penultimate Wednesday. He was reacting to the decision by the PDP 37-person zoning committee to fling open the partys presidential ticket to all aspirants.\n\nAccording to him, those pushing against power shift to the South, particularly the Southeast region are toying with the corporate existence of the nation.\n\nHe said, Some desperate politicians are doing everything possible to scuttle the zoning arrangement of their political parties. For the purpose of fairness, equity, and justice, PDP (zoning committee) to rescind its decision and relinquish its presidential ticket to the South.\n\nIn the spirit of uniting this country, it is good if all critical statesmen support a presidential material from the South who has the experience, political acumen, sound economic knowledge, and acceptability across the country to lead this country in 2023.\n\nZopmal maintained that the PDP and even the ruling APC, both have credible and competent politicians from the South who can rescue Nigeria from the throes of insecurity and economic backwardness.\n\nWe urge the two major political parties to consider Mr. Peter Obi, Ex Anambra State Governor (PDP), and Ekiti Governor Kayode Fayemi (APC) with their tickets because they are light of democracy and they represent the interest of Nigerian youths.\n\nWe urge political parties in Nigeria to be agents of national unity and progress by shifting their presidential tickets to the South. There is no shortcut to democracy. Political parties have a key role in giving Nigeria quality leaders that can truly unite this country and move it forward. We sue for peaceful and credible primary elections ahead.\n\nThe only way to find lasting political stability in this country is for the relevant security agencies to advise politicians to stop unguarded and inflammatory utterances on the 2023 general elections.\n\nAs it stands, elements in the North pushing for the region\u2019s retention of power will have an uphill task as the idea may hit brick walls given opposition to it . On this time will tell who carries the day.",

          "title": "Experts weigh in as FG, World Bank/IMF clash over subsidy, forex",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nPolicy steps in the management of petrol subsidy and foreign exchange have continued to be a big issue, as the multilateral financial institutions continue to warn that Nigerian economy is facing serious threats, with the federal government maintaining positions that negate the recommendations of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe Senate penultimate week approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022, a figure representing the amount contained in two separate requests by President Mohammadu Buhari, to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nA plan by the government to deregulate the sector, following enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (2021) that prescribes a free market for the downstream sector of the petroleum industry had been suspended by 18 months.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the total cost of subsidy in January and February, 2022 alone was N396.72 billion while the cost of subsidizing the product in 2020 was N450 billion.\n\nDespite the steep rise in crude oil price and Nigerias position as a major crude oil exporter, the country\u2019s economic structure makes it more prone to the negative effects of the ongoing escalation between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe country has almost zero refining capacity as its four refineries remain comatose despite gulping several billions of naira annually on Turn Around Maintenance (TAM).\n\nCrude oil prices spiralled above $100 per barrel, the first time since 2014, after Russia attacked Ukraine and continued a major aggressive push of what it called special military operation to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine by destroying the latters military capabilities.\n\nThe resultant rise in Nigeria\u2019s import bill for petroleum products has conspired with other reserve-depleting activities of the government to complicate the woes of the naira, with the central bank making concerted efforts to defend the local currency, another measure the global economic experts find unsustainable.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has maintained an official exchange rate of around $1/N415, while the parallel market reflects an exchange rate of around $1/570.\n\nBriefing journalists during the just concluded World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings in Washington DC, the President of the World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass, reiterated the need for the federal government to reconsider its policy on fuel subsidy, saying that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled to other critical sectors.\n\nThe World Bank had last November warned Nigeria that further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see federal and state governments unable to pay salaries from 2022.\n\nThe Lead Economist, Nigeria Country office of the World Bank, Marco Antonio Hernandez, had painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria if the country decides to continue with the controversial fuel subsidy.\n\nBut speaking during the media briefing, Malpass pointed out that generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system.\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the World Bank boss reiterated the need for the country to do away with multiple exchange rate system, which according to him was often, complicated and is not as effective as it would be if there were a single exchange rate.\n\nHe added: The most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help.\n\nThe IMF has also maintained that the policies of fuel subsidies and official exchange rates are ineffective and advised the government to drop them to propel growth.\n\nAccording to its Executive Boards conclusion of the Article IV consultation with Nigeria, which was released recently, Directors also urged the removal of untargeted fuel subsidies, with compensatory measures for the poor and transparent use of saved resources.\n\nIMF advised the CBN to unify the exchange rate by abandoning the official exchange rate in favour of a free market.\n\nDirectors welcomed the removal of the official exchange rate and recommended further measures towards a unified and market-clearing exchange rate to help strengthen Nigeria\u2019s external position, taking advantage of the current favourable conditions. They noted that exchange rate reforms should be accompanied by macroeconomic policies to contain inflation, structural reforms to improve transparency and governance, and clear communications regarding exchange rate policy, the report stated.\n\nBut the CBN has insisted that it will not float the naira to avoid an exchange rate spiral. Speaking with journalists also at the just concluded World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele explained that the apex banks managed float system was adopted to address the peculiar challenges of the country.\n\nThe governor said despite advice offered by IMF and the World Bank, developing economies such as Nigeria had the liberty of adopting homegrown solutions to their economic problems.\n\n\u201cThe IMF and World Bank provide advice that we work with. But even at some of our private meetings, we realise that there are challenges, leading us to adopt homegrown solutions to address them. We cannot adopt what is being proposed; we cannot adopt a free float of our currency,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nExperts views\n\nChief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr. Muda Yusuf, is among experts who share the view of World Bank. He noted that rather than a blessing, the rising global crude oil price is a penalty for the economy.\n\nYusuf, a former Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), in an interview, said the soaring oil price should ordinarily be a blessing and good news for the country as an oil producing entity.\n\n\u201cThis is because such development will naturally translate to more foreign exchange and revenue earnings for the country; more profits for the oil companies operating in Nigeria and for other stakeholders in the oil sector,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, regrets that because the countrys oil sector has been grossly mismanaged, the obvious boom in the price of the commodity cannot be celebrated.\n\nThe rising oil price cannot be celebrated by Nigeria because it penalises the Nigerian economy and this is a paradox. The implication of this rise in oil price is that our import bill for petroleum products is going up; the subsidy payment on petrol is going to increase.\n\n\u201cIf this trend continues this way in another six months, then Nigeria should be looking at a subsidy cost of about N5 trillion or more, Yusuf warned.\n\nOn forex, Yusuf called for an urgent review of the current foreign exchange policy.\n\nHe said, My proposition is that we should adopt a flexible exchange rate policy regime. Let me clarify that this is not a devaluation proposition. Rather is it is a pricing mechanism that reflects the demand and supply fundamentals in the foreign exchange market.\n\nIt is a model that is sustainable, predictable and transparent. It is a policy regime that would reduce uncertainty and inspire the confidence of investors. It is a policy framework that would minimize discretion and arbitrage in the foreign exchange allocation mechanism.\n\nSimilarly, Director, Centre for Petroleum, Energy Economics and Law, University of Ibadan, Professor Adeola Adenikinju, noted that the governments decision to continue subsidy payment was more political than economic, given the revenue challenges facing governments at all levels.\n\nHe argued that by retaining the petrol subsidy, the government would find it difficult to meet other commitments.\n\n\u201cIt is a political decision, not an economic one. Economically, we know that subsidies have been very costly to the country and this is going to have serious implications on government revenue, particularly the state governments.\n\nThe states are going to feel it more because they depend heavily on revenue from the Federation Account and secondly, they do not have the leverage to borrow like the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf it goes ahead, the states are going to be hard-hit financially and it is going to be extremely difficult for them to meet all their commitments in terms of payment of salaries and keeping their obligations to pensioners.\u201d\n\nHowever, a public affairs analyst, Mr. Stanley Johnson, described IMFs recommendations as unrealistic, given the peculiar situation inAfrica.\n\nWhat baffles me is that over the years, the IMF has seen that deep seated corruption, indiscipline and impunity by African leaders would never allow these countries to reap the benefits of some of these recommendations, yet they continue to give them, Johnson observed.\n\n\u201cMaybe, its time for the IMF to adjust their policies with regard to corrupt countries like Nigeria which may include but not limited to appointing their own personnel to run the economies of qualifying countries heavily indebted to the Fund for a stipulated number of years, to ensure the attainment of the economic paradise their recommendations promised.",

He ceased posting on his Facebook on 19 November 2020, when he ran another disclaimer for another scammer \u2018Maxwell Odums\u2019, based in Lagos.\n\nAfter the real Maxwell vanished, leaving his clients poorer, the EFCC declared him wanted in December 2021.\n\nThe agency accuses him of money laundering, Conspiracy and obtaining Money by false Pretence.\n\nEFCC says Odum is a native of Ikwerre in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cHis last known address is 7 Odum Street, Elekahia, Port Harcourt\u201d, said EFCC head of media and publicity, Wilson Uwujaren.\n\nIn the meantime, Odum\u2019s depositors are wailing on his Facebook page, as they could not get their money back.\n\nOne of the victims, Grant Ogaga Etaghara who lives in Sapele, pleaded with Odum to return his principal sum of N1,100,000.\n\n\u201cI need the total capital that I deposited for investment in my bank account as soon as possible:, he wrote on Odum\u2019s wall on Facebook.\n\nHe could well be addressing a stone. He started his investment in October. By November, Odum\u2019s MBA failed to pay him his first ROI.\n\nIfunanya Elizabeth Ilechukwu, who reacted to Odum\u2019s warning about another scammer said: There\u2019s no difference between you and the scammer\u2026 Pay people that ROI or your refund their money\u2026 criminal\u201d\n\nPraize Favour another victim rained curses on Odum: \u201cMBA, my blood will be on your head. I can\u2019t get my treatments because you refused to pay me my money. I am undergoing kidney dialysis every week, but has stopped due to lack of money. If I die my blood will forever cry against you\u201d, he wrote.\n\nFrank Anthony who was still expecting some redemption of his capital also wrote:\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, my name is Mcanthony Francis With the email [email protected] . I invested a sum of #360,000 naira and currently the investment has expired over the 6 months. But I would like to withdraw the capital which I haven\u2019t seen on my dashboard. Pls update it thanks and send it thanks\u2026am using that your old online platform not this new migration one.\n\n\u201cAnd pls note there was an extra 3 days in this investment\u2026.I believe that there should be an extra sum to the capital return\u201d.\n\nHope Ayibo Duke discovered too late she had been fleeced as she begged for the return of her money.\n\n\u201cOga I don\u2019t want to do again please give my money back I want to pay bill if anything happens to me Nigeria should hold Maxwell Odum and his team responsible.\u201d\n\nWhen many customers suspected they had been scammed, Odum sent an online message, blaming the internet for some of the problems being encountered by the customers.\n\nValue Obinna does not pity the lamenting victims, blaming them for being greedy.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe reason for getting a fast and doubling money in the name of ROI or ROP as a means of one\u2019s investments has landed many into untimely death, illness and unrecovered shocks.\n\n\u201cHow can you handover your money to an individual to give you 5times of your investment within a very short period of 3 to 6months???\n\n\u201cThat is the highest height of greed, when you can buy and resell gold, landed properties, invest in interstate transportation, filmmaking and entertainment in general Or still, open a personal business of yours and invest your capital on it and watch it grow\u201d.\n\nThe EFCC has asked Nigerians who have information on Maxwell Odum to call all its offices in Benin, Kaduna, Ibadan, Sokoto. Gombe, Maiduguri, Makurdi, Ilorin, Enugu, Kano, Lagos, Gombe, Port Harcourt and Abuja.\n\nThe commission gave its hotlines: 09-9044751-3, 08093322644, 08183322644, 07026350721-3, 070-6350724-5.\n\nContact can also be made through its e-mail address: info efcenigerin.org or the nearest Police Station and other security agencies\u201d, Uwujaren said.\n\nThe victims of Odum in Akwa Ibom have formed a Facebook group to share information and monitor EFCC\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe group is called MBA Angry Investors.\n\nCoordinator of the group, Offor Okorie said in a post on 20 March that the first list of Maxwell Odum\u2019s victims has been compiled for the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWe MBA investors in Nigeria have submitted the first phase of investors bank details and statements of account as required. We are now in the seconnd phase of collation\u201d, Okorie said.\n\nHowever, some investors are getting anxious and impatient that the crook called Maxwell Odum has not yet been arrested by EFCC.\n\n\u201cIs like EFCC has colluded with Maxwell Odum to embezzle our money because, since Maxwell Odum was declared wanted, he hasn\u2019t been arrested.

Only the Nazis were Nazis and only they dealt with the systematic destruction of the Jewish people,\u201d said Lapid, whose grandfather died in the Holocaust.\n\nA German government spokesperson said on Monday that Lavrov\u2019s comment on Hitler was \u201cabsurd\u201d propaganda.\n\nIsrael has expressed repeated support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February.\n\nBut wary of straining relations with Russia, a powerbroker in neighbouring Syria, it initially avoided direct criticism of Moscow and has not enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs.\n\nHowever, relations have grown more strained, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian president has also run into flak in Israel by looking to draw analogies between the conflict in his country and World War Two.\n\nIn an address to the Israeli parliament in March, Zelenskiy compared the Russian offensive in Ukraine to Nazi Germany\u2019s plan to murder all Jews within its reach during World War Two.\n\nYad Vashem called his comments \u201cirresponsible,\u201d saying they trivialised the historical facts of the Holocaust.",

          "title": "Low-cut trends among women",
          "text": "For centuries, it has been a belief that a woman\u2019s hair is her crowning glory but now women adorning different low-cut styles have become a common sight.\n\nFor various reasons, some women have embraced going on low-cut just for their convenience and damning the traditional or religious consequences.\n\nSome women in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos, gave reasons they prefer low haircuts to wearing the modern wigs, braids, and weave-on.\n\nTemitope Lawanson, a mother of two, said the weather had not been friendly enough to fix weaves.\n\n\u201cLagos weather will humble you. Then again, getting my hair done is another tug of war with hair beauticians, who tend to overbook clients. So, at times you end up rescheduling.\n\n\u201cI love my hair now, although I still have my wigs for when I want to change my looks, make no mistake, maintaining a low cut is more expensive,\u201d she said.\n\nNkiru Ifeajuna, a journalist, said that since when she was little, she hated plaiting her hair.\n\n\u201cI prefer low-cut to plaiting my hair. You know, putting my head into the hot dryer, plaiting my hair after two weeks is very uncomfortable and as a journalist, I\u2019m always on the go, It\u2019s better I cut my hair and carry it for months.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to take permission from anyone, my parents especially my dad encouraged me, and I also dye my hair in different colors because of my grey hair,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ifeajuna, if the purpose of going on low-cut is to save cost, the purpose is defeated because its maintenance is more expensive.\n\n\u201cPlaiting hair is cheaper because if I want to cut my hair in my local salon the least I spend is N5,000 and to dye will cost more too,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Oluwaseun Babatunde, a biochemist, said the maintenance of low-cut wasn\u2019t expensive but convenient.\n\n\u201cI always feel pain on a particular side of my head, I decided to cut my hair, I like it because it is not permanent,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that the feeling of pouring water on the head daily could not be compared to anything.\n\n\u201cIf I had my hair plaited, that means water will only touch my head fortnightly or monthly. I just can\u2019t bear that situation,\u201d Babatunde said.\n\nCynthia Agu, a trader, said that she couldn\u2019t cope with the stress of making hair.\n\n\u201cI was actually plaiting my hair before but the stress was becoming unbearable at some point, so I cut it off. Now I\u2019m enjoying the process,\u201d she said.\n\nAgu told NAN that maintenance of hair cut depended on the individual.\n\n\u201cI cut mine very low with N500, so it can last for a month, but some may prefer to do different styles with theirs and it costs much.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m not stressing my husband, he\u2019s fine with it. But I think he is beginning to love my low-cut,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to a barber, Ezekiel Matthew, women going on low cut has become a trend that has come to stay.\n\n\u201cI love women that cut their hair short, It\u2019s unique in a way, just like when you see guys braiding their hair too. It\u2019s just a different taste when it comes to looks,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthew, who is also a make-up artist, told NAN that no fewer than 10 ladies come to his salon daily to have their hair cut into different styles.\n\n\u201cWomen generally adapt to the style that fits and complement their looks.

For some, it keeps them away from the salon for 2-3 weeks depending on the style and we put into consideration the nature of their businesses when choosing a style.\n\n\u201cFor cut, texture relaxed treatment and style, it is from N15,000 here at our salon.

Furthermore, the Presidency in Nigeria will rotate among the zones to promote peace, unity and progress.\n\n\u201cThe NEF is aware that Nigeria has religiously followed the rotation and zoning principle since 1999 with Chief Olusegun Obasanjo (South West) as the elected President of Nigeria. Obasanjo, in keeping with the rotation principle, handed over to former President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua ( North West) in 2007.\n\n\u201cWith the death of Yar\u2019Adua, a Southerner, specifically the South-South, in the person of Dr Goodluck Jonathan was elected as President. Jonathan also handed over to a Northerner, President Muhammadu Buhari, whose second tenure of four years will end in 2023. By the rotation and zoning principle that has been in operation in Nigeria, it is only fair that the Presidency be zoned to the South, specifically the South-East region,\u201d he said.\n\nSome stakeholders have been clamouring that the Southeast should produce Nigeria\u2019s next President in 2023.",

          "text": "Rattled by an order of a Federal High Court Abuja in a suit seeking to scuttle its May 28, 2022 presidential primary, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has approached the Court of Appeal in Abuja.\n\nAbia state Commissioner of Trade and Investment Cosmos Ndukwe had dragged PDP and Chairman of its Primary Election Planning Committee and National Secretary of the party, Senator Samuel Anyanwu and others before the court praying that the primary election be stopped.\n\nHis grouse was premised on the alleged refusal of PDP to zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 presidential election to South-East geo-political zone and his disqualification from participating in the presidential primary election.\n\nIn addition, the aggrieved PDP presidential aspirant, also in the originating summons marked FHC/ABJ/CS/508/2022, filed an ex-parte application for an order to restrain PDP from going ahead with the primary election until his suit was fully determined.\n\nWhile ruling on the ex-parte application argued by Paul Erokoro (SAN) April 28, the presiding judge, Justice Donatus Okorowo refused to grant the request of the plaintiff who was a former Deputy Speaker in the Abia State House of Assembly.\n\nThe application was challenged by counsel to PDP, Mr Kalu Agu who urged the judge not to grant the plaintiff \u2019s request.\n\nJustice Okorowo further ordered PDP and its Primary Election Planning Committee to appear before the court May 5 to show cause on why the primary election should not be stopped at the instance of the suit brought before him by the plaintiff.\n\nBut dissatisfied with the High Court\u2019s decision, the Primary Election Planning Committee Chairman, Senator Anyanwu, filed a notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal in Abuja praying that the order of Justice Okorowo be set aside.\n\nAmong others, the appellant, (Senator Anyanwu) claimed the Judge erred in law by denying him fair hearing in breach of section 36 (1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAnyanwu argued: \u201cThe learned trial judge erred in entertaining an exparte motion which seeks to stop the presidential primary election of the appellant without hearing notice\u201d, adding that the court further erred in law when it failed to \u201caver its mind to section 84(15) of the Electoral Act, 2022, before making an order to show cause.\u201d\n\nThe appellant in the Notice of Appeal dated April 29, further urged the court to allow the appeal and set aside the ruling of Justice Okorowo asking the PDP to show cause why its scheduled primary election should not be halted.\n\nHe asserted that the originating summon of the plaintiff was not ripe for hearing and that the time for him to file counter affidavit against the suit had not lapsed when the Judge gave the order.\n\nSenator Anyanwu further asserted that the Judge erred in not directing the plaintiff to put him (Anyanwu) on notice but rather, directed him to show cause on an ex-parte application allegedly anchored on an incompetent originating summons.\n\nHe, therefore, asked the Court of Appeal to void and set aside the order of the Federal High Court of April 28 asking him to show cause on why the primary election should not be stopped.\n\nApart from Ndukwe, other respondents in the appeal are the PDP, the party\u2019s national chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as 1st to 4th respondents respectively.\n\nThe notice of appeal was filed on his behalf by an Abuja lawyer, Kalu Agu.\n\nOur correspondent reports that no date has yet been fixed for hearing of the matter as at the time of this report\n\nPDP files preliminary objection\n\nAlso, the PDP , in a Notice of Preliminary Objection filed Friday by its lawyer, Mr Mahmud Magaji (SAN), submitted that the subject matter of the case which borders on whether to zone its presidential ticket to any part of the country is not an issue that the court has the mandate to decide.\n\nThe party said, rather than grant the request, the judge ordered that the PDP appear before it and show cause why the court should not accede to the plaintiff\u2019s demand.\n\nThe PDP asked the court to strike out the suit for want of jurisdiction and also dismiss it for being \u201cstatute-barred\u201d.\n\nAccording to the defendants, \u201cthe cause of action in the suit relates to the internal affairs of a political party and therefore falls within the doctrine of political questions which are non-justiciable\u201d and as such the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain it.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of statute-barred, the PDP noted that the cause of action arose from the PDP National Zoning Committee Communique of April 5 whereas the plaintiff\u2019s suit was filed on April 19 (15 days after) in violation of Section 285 of the Constitution which provides for 14 days to file such cases.\n\nWhile arguing further that the plaintiff lacked the necessary legal right to initiate the case, the PDP submitted that no civil right of the plaintiff has been wronged pursuant to section 6(6) of the Constitution.\n\nThe party, therefore, urged the court to uphold its objection and dismiss the case of the plaintiff, adding that the plaintiff would not be prejudiced or suffer any hardship if the case was dismissed.\n\nShare this:

The battle waged against terrorists who falsely masquerade under the name of Islam is approaching its conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe fight has been long and hard. Final victory is within sight. Boko Haram and its offshoots\u2019 final embers are now fading.\n\n\u201cLast month, the leader of ISWAP was killed in an airstrike. Since the New Year, thousands of fighters have surrendered to enter rehabilitation programmes. The territories they used to occupy are now seeing the return of those who were forced to flee their barbarity. Normality is finally beginning to return to the Northeast. It is a long process. Yet it is one we are, together, now embarking upon.\n\n\u201cWith the designation of bandit groups as terrorists, the challenges of banditry and kidnapping are being tackled differently in the North-western and North Central states where the latest military acquisitions and the Armed Forces are being fanned out across the region to thwart acts of terror.\n\n\u201cThe administration is equally getting impressive reports of the special operations to curb crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering in the South-South, with millions of illegally refined products being impounded and illegal refineries destroyed.\n\n\u201cWhile we are making progress cleaning the environment, some evil people are busy causing more pollution and destruction.\n\n\u201cIn response to the disturbing rise in criminal attacks targeting law enforcement and public facilities in the South East, concerted military operations to rid the region of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN) elements have, in recent weeks, led to the overrunning of IPOB/ESN bases, the seizure of weapons and the arrest of a large number of suspects.\u201d\n\nAlso, the statement said the president approved the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta, Imo state.\n\nShehu said: \u201cThe reinvigoration of the war against drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking is also showing positive results as shown by the arrest of over 12, 300 offenders including seven drug barons; the conviction of 1,400, counseling and rehabilitation of about 8,000 drug users.\n\n\u201cThe seizure of over 3.4 million kilograms of drugs and cash worth over N130 billion, all in 2021 has been recorded while the first Quarter of this year has seen the arrest of no fewer than 3,536 offenders including security personnel and a well-known billionaire drug baron. The seizure of more than 65,000 tons of assorted drugs in this period sets a record for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari also directed increased coordination and cooperation among security agencies, saying that an end has been brought to a silo approach among the agencies, assuring that there will be no shortage of funds to provide security for the citizens.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

We want our youths to be prepared to identify opportunities and productively utilize luck\u201d.\n\nHe explained: \u201cAs we say, leadership is about service to the led. So, my interest to go back to politics after my career in the CBN is to demonstrate to the electorate in my senatorial communities that after darkness, there will be light.\n\n\u201cI have been there before to help them in terms of leading by example politically and I am now better prepared and more determined to proof that politics is about serving the interests of the people by using the opportunity availed by political authority to transform lives of the ordinary people, especially the poor and socio-economically excluded in our communities.\n\nLending credence to the aspirant\u2019s promises, a young man from Dr. Tumala\u2019s constituency who simply identified himself as Mallam Mustapha, told the journalists that \u201cthis is not the first time that our leader, Hon. Mohammed Tumala, is indicating his interest to serve us politically. He was elected before into the House of Representatives and he served us to be best of his ability.\n\n\u201cOur people are still talking about what he did then till today. So, our joining him to collect his nomination form is to show we are strongly behind him and will cast our votes for him come 2023, insha Allah\u201d, Mustapha assured.\n\nIt would be recalled that Dr. (Hon) Tumala had earlier been elected into the House of Representatives in 1992 and served until 1994 when the democratic regime was truncated by the military. Before then, he was a lecturer at the University of Maiduguri for 19 years.",

          "text": "Ukrainian authorities planned to evacuate more civilians from Mariupol on Monday, after dozens were finally brought to safety following weeks trapped under heavy fire in a steel complex.\n\nThe sprawling Azovstal plant is the last holdout of Ukrainian forces in the strategic southern port city, which has been besieged by Russian forces since they invaded Ukraine on February 24.\n\nThe United Nations said Sunday that a \u201csafe passage operation\u201d was taking place at the Azovstal plant, which includes a maze of Soviet-era underground tunnels.\n\nAccording to Kyiv, roughly 100 civilians have been evacuated from the plant, although Russia\u2019s defence ministry gave a lower figure of 80 civilians, including women and children.\n\n\u201cThose who wished to leave for areas controlled by the Kyiv regime were handed over to UN and ICRC (Red Cross) representatives,\u201d the Russian ministry said.\n\nIn a regular address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said those evacuated were due to arrive in Ukraine-controlled Zaporizhzhia on Monday, with further evacuations planned that day.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory. More than 100 civilians have already been evacuated \u2014 women and children first of all,\u201d he said.\n\nThe head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration said that Monday\u2019s evacuation was due to begin at 7:00 am local time (0400 GMT).\n\n\u2013 Lyman expected to fall \u2013\n\nOne Russian news report put the number of civilians still in the plant at more than 500.\n\nMariupol is an important strategic hub connecting the Russian-held southern and eastern parts of Ukraine and has seen some of the worst of the fighting.\n\nWith the Russian siege leaving residents in dire conditions, with little access to food water and medicine, the city has become emblematic of a war that has uprooted more than 13 million people from their homes and killed thousands.\n\nRussian forces continued their push into eastern Ukraine on Sunday, killing eight civilians in rocket attacks in Donetsk and Kharkiv, the regions\u2019 governors said.\n\nMoscow\u2019s army has refocused on the east, notably the Donbas region, which includes Donetsk and Lugansk, after failing to take the capital Kyiv in the first few weeks of the war.\n\nLyman, a former railway hub known as the \u201cred town\u201d for its redbrick industrial buildings, is expected to be one of the next places to fall after Ukrainian forces withdrew.\n\nRussian forces appeared to have made notable advances around the town, advancing on their positions by several kilometres, an AFP team in the area said Sunday.\n\nRussia has moved to solidify its grip on areas it controls and from Sunday introduced the Russian ruble in the region of Kherson \u2014 initially to be used alongside the Ukrainian hryvnia.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Relentless fear\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cBeginning May 1, we will move to the ruble zone,\u201d Kirill Stremousov, a civilian and military administrator of Kherson, was cited as saying by Russia\u2019s state news agency RIA Novosti.\n\nHe said the hryvnia could be used during a four-month period, but then \u201cwe will completely switch to settlements in rubles\u201d.\n\nOn the frontline in the east, Russian troops \u2014 helped by massive use of artillery \u2014 have advanced slowly but steadily.\n\nBut Ukrainian forces have also recaptured some territory in recent days, including the village of Ruska Lozova, which evacuees said had been occupied for two months.\n\n\u201cIt was two months of terrible fear. Nothing else, a terrible and relentless fear,\u201d Natalia, a 28-year-old evacuee from Ruska Lozova, told AFP after reaching Kharkiv.\n\nKyiv has admitted that Russian forces have captured a string of villages in the Donbas region and has asked Western powers to deliver more heavy weapons to bolster its defences there.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands that we must guard the line here,\u201d Lieutenant Yevgen Samoylov of the 81st Brigade told AFP as his unit rotated away from the front line near the town of Sviatogirsk.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let the enemy move closer. We try to hold it with all our force.\u201d\n\nKyiv said Monday that its drones had sunk two Russian patrol boats near the Black Sea\u2019s Snake Island, which became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance after soldiers there rebuffed Russian demands to surrender.\n\n\u201cThe Bayraktars are working,\u201d said Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, in a defence ministry statement, referring to Turkish-made military drones.\n\n\u2013 Further EU sanctions \u2013\n\nWestern powers have sought to up the pressure on Russia as its onslaught on Ukraine drags on, with sources telling AFP Sunday that the European Union will propose a phased-out ban on Russian oil imports as part of its fresh round of sanctions against Moscow.\n\nThe European Commission, which draws up sanctions for the EU\u2019s 27 countries, is preparing the text, which could be put to the member states as early as Wednesday, diplomats said.\n\nSeveral diplomats said the ban on oil was made possible after a policy U-turn by Germany, which had resisted the measure as too disruptive and potentially harmful to its economy.\n\nOn Saturday, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi met President Zelensky, becoming the most senior US government official to visit since the war began.\n\n\u201cDo not be bullied by bullies,\u201d she told reporters at a news conference in Rzeszow in southern Poland on Sunday after returning from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIf they are making threats, you cannot back down.\u201d\n\nShe promised to enact the $33 billion (31 billion euro) arms and support package announced by US President Joe Biden last week.\n\nRussia has been seeking ways to push back against the growing international pressure.\n\nThe speaker of the lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, suggested Moscow could seize Russia-based assets of countries it deems hostile. \u201cIt is fair to take reciprocal measures,\u201d he said.",

Today, April 30, 2022 is all about Nigerian youths. We are supporting Yahaya Bello for this and no one else. That he has the capacity to solve the problem of insecurity and a host of others facing the nation is not in doubt.\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of the country. We must give youths a chance, especially one that has demonstrated uncommon capacity, in the person of Yahaya Bello,\u201d he said.\n\nUwazuruike, who is also the Founder of Biafran Independent Movement, said that he does not believe in a president of Igbo extraction, insisting that the contest should be thrown open.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd that had come to welcome him at the APC Secretariat last Wednesday, Bello had said, \u201cRight now, what we have ahead of us is a task of canvassing and consulting all party faithfuls, leaders, delegates and stalwarts, members and all Nigerians, at home and even in the diaspora to support us so that we become the flagbearer of this great party come 30 and 31 of May 2022. And by the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.\u201d",

While insisting that the police also erred in executing the arrest without a known court warrant of arrest, Peterside vowed that Rivers State would not allow Wike to prosper in his quest to turn the state into an Italy of Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism held sway until the world rallied democracy against them. \u201cRivers State cannot become an Italy of Benito Mussolini, or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism and dictatorship contracted an evil marriage of convenience that bestrode and muzzled free speech and fundamental rights of citizens. What Wike is working at is to annex every independent mind and cow every Rivers citizen into sheepish acquiescence. But what he plays ignorant of is that from the times of Dappa Biriye, Melford Okilo, Obi Wali, TImothy Birabi, all nationalists and Democrats, Rivers had never suffered fools to muzzle them. So, we shall keep to that historic attitude and would never surrender to Wike and his goons.\u201d\n\nPeterside, who is the immediate past Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, queried Gov. Wike on how he obtained evidence linking the lawmaker to an alleged disruption of proceedings at the Rivers State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. \u201cWike had lied at several times such that these days his claims must be subjected to forensic investigation before believed. So, Rivers people need know how he proved Dagogo\u2019s link to whatever happened at their party Secretariat\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile calling on lovers of democracy and free speech to condemn Wike and his fascist style of governance, Peterside reiterated his 48-hour ultimatum to Gov. Wike to order the release of the detailed lawmaker. \u201cWike has 48 hours to ensure that Honourable Farah is set free and allowed to continue to pursue his political aspiration. Nothing short of that shall avail. Wike cannot be junketing in pursuit of his presidential ambition using Rivers State resources while wickedly gagging another\u2019s on the altar of ego. He must let Dagogo go\u201d, , Peterside averted.",

          "text": "Humanitarian organisations worked to evacuate more civilians from the devastated Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Monday but hundreds of people remained trapped in the Azovstal steel works, the last stronghold of resistance to the Russian siege.\n\nA first group of evacuees was due to arrive in a Ukrainian-held town northwest of Mariupol on Monday. But Russian forces resumed shelling the steel works on Sunday as soon as the buses had left the plant, a city official said.\n\nPeople still stuck there were running out of water, food and medicine as Russian forces hemmed them into the industrial complex, whose network of bunkers and tunnels has provided shelter from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\u201cThe situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,\u201d Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.\n\nIntense Russian bombardments were also hitting towns in eastern Ukraine on Monday, causing severe damage, a regional governor said.\n\nOn the international front, EU energy ministers were due to hold emergency talks on Moscow\u2019s demand that European buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles or face their supply being cut off.\n\nWhile the EU has imposed heavy economic sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, the issue of Russian energy supplies has posed a dilemma that threatens to crack the united front.\n\nLOOKING EAST\n\nThe Russian military is now focusing on crushing resistance in Ukraine\u2019s south and east after failing to capture Kyiv in the early weeks of the war, now in its third month.\n\nIts assaults have flattened cities, killed thousands of civilians and forced more than 5 million to flee the country. Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov, has become emblematic of the brutality of the war and the suffering of ordinary people.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces are now in control of nearly all the city, linking up Russian-held territory to the west and east.\n\nAround 100 civilians evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks were due to arrive in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia, 230 km northwest of Mariupol, on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we had two days of a ceasefire on this territory, and we managed to take out more than 100 civilians \u2013 women, children,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address.\n\nFootage from inside the steelworks showed members of the Azov regiment helping civilians though rubble and on to a bus.\n\nBut hundreds remain trapped inside. One older evacuee accompanied by young children said survivors were running out of food.\n\n\u201cChildren always wanted to eat. You know, adults can wait,\u201d she said.\n\nRussia last week said it had decided against storming the steel works and would instead blockade it. But sporadic bombardments have continued.\n\n\u201cYesterday, as soon as the buses left Azovstal with the evacuees, new shelling began immediately,\u201d Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the Mariupol mayor, told Ukrainian television.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it was taking part in the evacuation operation along with the United Nations and Ukrainian and Russian officials.\n\nMore than 50 civilians arrived at a temporary accommodation centre in Russian-controlled territory on Sunday after escaping from Mariupol, a Reuters photographer said. read more\n\n\u2018UNTIL VICTORY\u2019\n\nMoscow calls its invasion a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and rid it of anti-Russian nationalism fomented by the West. Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression that threatens to spiral into a much wider conflict.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Sunday Moscow only wanted to guarantee the security of pro-Russian Ukrainians in the east and was not demanding that Zelenskiy surrender as a condition for peace.\n\n\u201cOur aim does not include regime change in Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov said in an interview published on his ministry\u2019s website.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military said on Monday Russian forces were trying to take over the eastern town of Rubizhne and prepare an assault on Sievierodonetsk.\n\nLuhansk region Governor Serhiy Gaidai said three people had been killed by shelling over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe heaviest clashes were taking place around Popasna, to the west of the Russian-held regional capital. The shelling was so intense they could not even collect the bodies, he said.\n\n\u200b\u201dI don\u2019t even want to speak about what\u2019s happening with the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now. These cities simply don\u2019t exist anymore. They have completely destroyed them.\u201d\n\nLuhansk region Governor Serhiy Gaidai said three people had been killed by shelling over the past 24 hours.\n\nThe heaviest clashes were taking place around Popasna, to the west of the Russian-held regional capital. The shelling was so intense they could not even collect the bodies, he said.\n\n\u200b\u201dI don\u2019t even want to speak about what\u2019s happening with the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now. These cities simply don\u2019t exist anymore. They have completely destroyed them.\u201d\n\nMoscow is pushing for complete control of the Donbas region, where Russian-backed separatists already controlled parts of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces before the invasion.\n\nIn Russia, two explosions took place on Monday in Belgorod, a southern region bordering Ukraine, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. The cause of the blasts was not clear but the Kremlin has accused Ukraine of making cross-border attacks. Gladkov said there were no casualties.\n\nEU PONDERS MOVES\n\nIn Brussels, EU energy ministers were due to meet in a bid find a way out of the dilemma posed by Russian energy supplies, which count for 40% of EU gas and 26% of its oil imports.\n\nGermany and others have so far resisted calls for an abrupt halt to Russian fuel imports for fear of economic damage, while Moscow is demanding that European buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles or face their supply being cut off.\n\nRussia halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last week after they refused to meet its demand to effectively pay in roubles.\n\nDiplomats said the EU is edging towards a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year.\n\nBut German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Monday some countries were not yet ready for an embargo of Russian oil. Germany did not want to trigger an economic catastrophe, he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria: South-East\u2019s Most Important Demand is Reintegration, Agitations Will End with Igbo Presidency, Says Ex-Senate President Anyim \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Former Senate President and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has said the ongoing agitations in some parts of the South East of Nigeria, was a reflection of the level of frustration by people of the zone, whose most important single demand was nothing but reintegration into the country.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in the third of a presidential interview series, Anyim, who responded to a question on how to reconcile his presidential bid with the heightened and violent agitation for Biafra by some people from the South-east, however, said with an Igbo presidency, the agitations would die naturally.\n\n\u201cThose agitating are frustrated, young, South-easterners, and I tell you, maybe I will put it this way, somebody asked me once, what is the single most important demands of the south east? And I replied, the most important single demand of the south-east from Nigeria is reintegration.\n\n\u201cOnce they feel that they have been fully reintegrated into Nigeria, all agitation will naturally be extinguished. So, my position is that if you give them a sense of belonging, and maybe expand opportunities for everybody, and they feel equal as citizens of Nigeria, those agitations will simply be extinguished.\u201d\n\nPushed further if his aspiration would not make the South East quest for secession a lot easier, Anyim, who was Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), explained that the agitations were not new, but has only been given life, because the issues have not been addressed at all.\n\n\u201cThe agitation for Biafra is neither isolated nor new. I remember during the June 12 crisis, there were such huge agitations in the South-west, that it is either they are part of this country, or they are not. And eventually, when one of them became the president of the country, that agitation died out.\n\n\u201cI also know that the militancy in the Niger Delta was so bad that if not for the way President Olusegun Obasanjo managed it, it would have led to agitations like this, and it was at a time everybody was so scared that if you allow somebody from South-south become president of Nigeria, they will graduate that agitation to secession.\n\n\u201cImmediately, President Goodluck Jonathan became president of Nigeria, that agitation died. In fact, not when he became president, immediately he became vice president of Nigeria, that agitation died out. IPOB agitation is not the only one in the country today.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of them across the country like the Boko Haram insurgency, like Sunday Igboho\u2019s agitation in the South-west. I believe that if a South-easterner becomes the president of Nigeria, that agitation will die,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what his take on restructuring was and the recent suggestion by a legal luminary, Chief Afe Babalola, that government should try out an interim government that would allow for a period of time to come up with a more viable constitution, Anyim said restructuring meant different things to different people.\n\nHis words: \u201cI avoid getting into the controversy of the definition of restructuring, but one thing I know is that the structure the country assumed at independence was extensively negotiated, extensively canvassed and extensively agreed on.\n\n\u201cThere were negotiations, there were constitutional conferences, and even at the last lap, the minorities raised issues or fears and the colonial masters set up the Willink\u2019s Commission to look into their fears. They didn\u2019t just decree a structure for the nation. No, they did not at all.\n\n\u201cSo, if we for any reason think that the present structure we have is not working, we have to sit down discuss it and build a consensus going forward, not anybody waking up to say, this is my definition of restructuring. If you throw in anything by your own definition, it will not work, because other components of the polity will not accept it.\n\n\u201cBut I agree that we could present a platform for dialogue, for negotiations, for discussions and build a consensus. Based on that consensus, if we need to make an adjustment, we\u2019ll make an adjustment as agreed by all and such adjustment everybody will commit to it in building the nation.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t want to go into the meaning of anybody\u2019s definition of restructuring. But I want to believe that if all of us feel that the structure we have today is not what we want, we will all sit over and agree on the structure that works for all of us and now carry on from there.\u201d\n\nTo Babalola, the Ebonyi-born politician said, \u201cI am surprised that Afe Babalola made that suggestion, because one, he is a seasoned lawyer and two, more particularly, because that is unconstitutional. And certainly there can\u2019t be a vacuum. So, what provision of our constitution will authorise interim government?\n\n\u201cSo, you can\u2019t preach the rule of law and step outside the law to set up a structure that cannot work. So, because it\u2019s unconstitutional, it has no space in our system. That cannot work.\n\n\u201cBut I also know that under any government, that the country can still have discussions. The country can still have negotiations and dialogue, and arrive at a consensus, that will be acceptable to everybody and we\u2019ll build our nation on that. So, certainly, that has no space in our system.\u201d",

          "text": "A new report by Renaissance Capital (RenCap), a frontier market investment company, has stated that despite crude oil prices at over $100 per barrel, the impact on Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position would remain negligible due to petrol subsidy payments and falling oil production by the country.\n\nIt also predicted that Nigeria would make a gross revenue of $25 billion from oil sales this year, although this would also have very insignificant impact on the country\u2019s fiscal position.\n\nIn the report titled, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Budget: Does it benefit from high oil prices?\u201d the firm, which also provides institutional research and financial advisory services, noted that on the fiscal front, the petrol subsidy and falling oil production undermines gains on the government revenue side. It estimated that subsidy cost could increase by $1.5 billion to $2 billion for a $10 per barrel change in the oil price, while net oil revenue could rise between $4 billion and $5 billion, without factoring in other externalities.\n\n\u201cThis implies that Nigeria has a $3 billion net benefit for every $10 per barrel change to the oil price (Brent),\u201d it stated.\n\nBut explaining that Nigeria\u2019s fiscal position would not benefit from high oil prices in 2022, the report noted that the swelling of the petrol subsidy as oil price increased and the fall in oil production due to theft and underinvestment would combine to hobble any gains from rising oil prices.\n\nThe federal government recently increased the 2022 subsidy budget from N443 billion to N4 trillion, after it shifted the planned removal of what it terms under-recovery by 18 months.\n\nRenCap said in the report, \u201cAn 80 per cent increase in the oil price, from $41/bbl to $72/bbl, reduced the budget deficit by about 1 ppt only. 2021 was an outlier. We attribute the widening of the deficit in 2021, despite the high oil price, to the fall in production that countered the price effect.\n\n\u201cOur \u2018trendline\u2019 suggests that if we assume an average oil price of $100/bbl for 2022 and production at pre-2021 levels, then the FGN\u2019s budget deficit would come in at about 3.5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We are forecasting a deficit of 4.7 per cent.\u201d\n\nAt the year-to-date average Brent crude price of about $100 per barrel, the Nigerian government, the report stated, took 45 per cent to 50 per cent of gross oil sales in the form of taxes and royalties. The remainder, it added, went to the contractor as cost recovery and profits.\n\nIt stressed, \u201cIn 2022, at $100/bbl Brent, we estimate that gross oil revenues to the government, mostly taxes and royalties, will be $24.8 billion/N10.3 trillion, that is 4.9 per cent of GDP, assuming the current FX rate of NGN415/$1, and net oil revenues at $17 billion/N7.1 trillion (3.4 per cent of GDP).\n\n\u201cOf this, 80 per cent stems from onshore/shallow water oil fields and the remainder from deepwater oil fields.\u201d\n\nStill at $100 per barrel, in 2022, it also estimated petrol subsidy to be 34 per cent of the government\u2019s gross oil revenue and 50 per cent of net oil revenues.\n\nAt the current N415 official rate of the naira to the dollar, on an accruals basis, RenCap estimated that the subsidy ranged between 23 per cent and 27 per cent of gross oil revenue for $60 110/bbl Brent.\n\nBut it added that the impact of a naira devaluation on the numbers at N500/$ and N600/$ and assuming that the pump price did not change, would raise subsidy to between $10 billion and $11.3 billion.\n\nAccording to the organisation, that is based on the assumption that Nigeria consumes 23 billion litres of petrol a year (400kbpd), taken from the most recent 12-month consumption data, forecasting that subsidy would only be wiped off when oil prices are below $45-$50 per barrel.\n\n\u201cBelow this price,\u201d it stated, \u201cthe government\u2019s take of oil proceeds is fully remitted and not undermined by petrol subsidy deductions. The reinstatement of the petrol subsidy in January partly explains the revision of the FY22 budget targets and assumptions, including the widening of the deficit target,\u201d\n\nIn April, the federal government revised its budget deficit target to four per cent per cent of GDP in 2022, as against its initial target of 3.4 per cent, on the back of new developments, including the Russia/Ukraine situation.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had written to the National Assembly calling for an amendment to the budget, to account for the wider deficit and increase in borrowing.\n\nBuhari said the new developments included the reinstatement of the petrol subsidy, the sharp increase in oil prices, and significantly lower crude production, mainly due to production shut-ins because of massive crude theft between the production platforms and terminals.\n\nThe president also proposed adjusting the government\u2019s budget assumptions to include the increase in the oil price benchmark to $73 per barrel, from $62/bbl previously, lower projected crude production to 1.60 mbd, from 1.88mbd previously, and an increase in the estimated provision for the petrol subsidy for 2022 to N4 trillion.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThis is also an increase when compared to the N3 trillion that the NNPC called for in January, soon after it was announced that the subsidy would remain in place.\n\n\u201cDue to the adjustments, the federation account revenue pool for the three tiers of government is projected to fall by N2.4 trillion (1.1 per cent of GDP, by our estimate), and the FGN\u2019s share by N1.2 trillion (0.6 per cent of GDP).\u201d\n\nThe document projected Nigeria\u2019s 2022 oil production to be within the 1.5 bpd to 1. 7 million bpd range, with 1.6 million bpd as midpoint, comprising one million onshore and shallow water production as well as 500k bpd for deepwater.\n\nIt explained that after deductions related to the oil and gas sector, including federally funded upstream capex, contributions to the 13 per cent derivation fund for the Niger Delta oil-producing states and other items, Nigeria\u2019s net oil revenue could be $17 billion in 2022.",
