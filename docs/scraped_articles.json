          "title": "Reps condemn Justice Odili\u2019s home invasion, frivolous court orders",
          "text": "The House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Judiciary has condemned the invasion of the home of a Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Peter-Odili, by security operatives and officials of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nChairman of the committee, Onofiok Luke, in a statement issued on Sunday in reaction to the invasion, noted that the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), would have to explain the circumstances surrounding the incident.\n\nLuke also reechoed the calls by the Chief Justice of the Federation, Justice Tanko Muhammad, that judicial officers should be cautious of the orders being issued by their courts.\n\nThe statement was titled \u2018The siege at Justice Peter-Odili\u2019s residence: A repudiation of judicial independence and an assault on the sanctity on the nation\u2019s judiciary\u2019.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Luke said, \u201cIt is mind boggling that in the dusk of 29 October 2021, the judiciary was once again exposed to public opprobrium due to the uncanny manner in which the residence of the Honourable Justice Mary Peter-Odili of the Supreme Court of Nigeria was invaded by law enforcement officials purportedly on an assignment to execute a search warrant issued by a magistrate.\n\n\u201cAlso disturbing is the fact that the said warrant was revoked by the issuing magistrate who had discovered that it was procured by the applicant on the premises of misrepresented facts.\n\n\u201cAs a committee currently interfacing with the judiciary for an improved judicial reform and justice system, we wish to lend our voice once again to the repeated call by His Lordship, the Honourable Justice Tanko Muhammed, CJN, on all Judicial officers on the need to exercise more caution in issuing ex-parte, conflicting and questionable orders that are capable of bringing disrepute to our Justice system.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker stated that it was an unfortunate development and a wake-up call to tighten administrative and supervisory control over the operations of law enforcement agencies in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo this end, we empathise with the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation who is constitutionally accountable for the actions and inaction of the law enforcement agents that purportedly executed the said warrant, placing on the AGF the unavoidable burden of defending his office before the populace.\n\n\u201cOn this note, the House of Representative Committee on the judiciary calls for a discreet investigation to unravel the persons behind this ignoble act, which is capable of straining the existing relationship between the judiciary and the executive arms of our democratic government.\u201d\n\nAccording to Luke, the siege is reminiscent of the 2016 incident where, in the beat of the night, security agencies invaded private residences of judicial officers.\n\nImo lawyers say invasion of Odili\u2019s residence barbaric\n\nMeanwhile, the five branches of the Nigerian Bar Association in Imo State on Sunday accused the Federal Government of deliberately intimidating the judiciary.\n\nTheir position was contained in a statement issued by the chairmen of the five branches -J.I. Ogamba for Owerri branch; Chief A.U. Ugboaja\u2013 Mbaise branch; R.C. Ndeme, \u2013Okigwe branch; B.A. Munonye, Orlu branch; and Chief Richard Anyanwu \u2013Mbano/Etiti branch.\n\nThey described the invasion of the Abuja residence of a Supreme Court\u2019s Justice, Mary Odili, as reprehensible, roguish and barbaric.\n\nThey called for investigation into the invasion, adding that the judiciary ought to be respected by the executive arm of government.\n\nThe statement read \u201cOn Friday, October 29, 2021, the Nigerian airwaves were inundated with the unfortunate news of the Gestapo like invasion/siege by unknown security agents at the Abuja residence of Honourable Justice Mary Peter-Odili.\n\n\u201cThis barbaric invasion is reminiscent of the better-forgotten and unsavoury invasions of the houses of justices and judges by officers of the Department of State Services in a purported \u2018sting operation\u2019 in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhereas, the purported order made by the Magistrate Court, Wuse, has been revoked by the Magistrate who made same; whereas all the relevant security agencies have denied involvement in this unfortunate incident; and whereas the Honourable the Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, has come out to deny knowledge of this barbaric action by rogue security agencies, these go to show that the shield bearers of our democracy (judiciary) are now easy preys to the same security agencies who are meant to protect them.\n\n\u201cLawyers in Imo State strongly condemn this reprehensible, roguish, barbaric and abominable invasion of the residence of the Honourable Justice Mary Peter-Odili, who is the second most senior Justice of the Supreme Court. We view this incident as a continuation of the unrelenting attempts and efforts by the government of the day to intimidate and cow the judiciary.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Police lack vehicles, fuel, communication gadgets, receive N58.9bn in six years",
          "text": "The Nigeria Police Force has yet to provide adequate patrol vehicles and two-way radios for most of its personnel despite receiving N58.9 billion for capital projects in six years.\n\nAnalysis of the police budgets from 2015 to 2020 indicates that the force proposed N115.8billion for capital projects while N58.9billion was released by the Federal Government.\n\nItems in the capital budget include security equipment, air navigational equipment, vehicles and trucks, industrial equipment, books, police stations, barracks, rehabilitation of residential and office buildings, aerodromes, and medical equipment.\n\nIn 2020, capital appropriation was N14.2billion but the amount released was N12.billion. In 2019, the police received N6.3billion capital vote out of the proposed N22,064,903 while N11.9billion was released out of the N25.1billion allocated in 2018.\n\nIn 2017, N9,099,136,000 was said to have been released out of the N20.1billion proposed for capital projects while N10, 026,818,000 was released out of the capital allocation of N16.1billion in 2016.\n\nThe NPF reportedly got N8.9billion out of N17.8billion proposed in its 2015 budget.\n\nThough the Ministry of Police Affairs allocated N20 million for the provision of two-way radios and security solutions for the police in its 2020 appropriation, there was no evidence that the gadgets were supplied.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the police commands and formations had a budget of N2,037,820,626, 202 out of the N7,786,923,450,732 allocated for national security between 2015 and 2020 by the government.\n\nPolice officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of sanction, said only senior officers were given two-way radios, adding that policemen on patrol depended on their mobile phones to communicate with their superiors.\n\nThis situation, it was gathered, had endangered many police officers who were sometimes unable to call for reinforcement while under attack due to a lack of standard police communication gadgets.\n\nA sergeant, who spoke with our correspondent on Wednesday, said only three officers have walkie-talkies in his department, out of the 12 policemen in the unit.\n\nThe traffic officer said, \u201cIn our department, only three men have communication radios out of the 12 men in the unit. They are the Division\u2019s Traffic Officer, the Deputy and an Inspector.\n\n\u201cThe other nine officers depend on cell phones to communicate with their superiors. And this is the situation in nearly all police stations and formations across the country.\u201d\n\nPolicemen on street patrol bemoaned the lack of infrastructure, particularly, vehicles, radios, bullet-proof vests, and other accoutrements as investigations showed that most of them do not wear bullet-proof vests or body armour while on duty.\n\nChecks revealed that many police vehicles are in terrible shape due to the inability of the force to replace them on account of poor funding by the Federal Government.\n\nIn the Federal Capital Territory, scores of broken-down vehicles have been abandoned at various locations in Area 1, Garki and a compound located in Idu Industrial Estate, Mbora District.\n\nResearch by a civil society organisation, Dataphyte, showed that the N3.5 billion budgeted for \u201cfuel/diesel/lubricant for direct delivery to state commands\u201d in the 2021 supplementary budget could only provide less than 12 litres of fuel daily for each of the estimated 5,556 police stations across the country.\n\nThis means each police station, regardless of its operational size, would have less than N2,000 a day to fuel their operational vehicles, besides the cost of lubricants and other maintenance costs.\n\nThe spokesman, Ministry of Police Affairs, Bolaji Kareem, explained that the vehicles provided for the police were equipped with communication gadgets.\n\nWhen asked about the number of police radios supplied to the police with the N20million in the ministry\u2019s budget, he pleaded for time to find out.\n\nHe said, \u201cRecently, the government procured some equipment for the police and most of their vehicles are equipped with walkie-talkies and other communication gadgets. But why not call the force public relations officer for more information to your question since it is an operational issue?\u201d\n\nThe force spokesman, Frank Mba, could not be reached on Thursday as he did not respond to questions sent to his phone.\n\nThe Commissioner representing the media in the Police Service Commission, Austin Braimoh, lamented that many police vehicles were being allocated to the homes of ministers and other top government officials, adding that Nigerians should be more concerned about police welfare.\n\nHe said, \u201cGo to a police station and see if they have vehicles. What is their response rate? Go to any of the police divisions, ask the officers the number of vehicles they have.\n\n\u201cEven when new vehicles are supplied, they are taken over by officers and some are being attached to ministers, to guard people in government. The vehicles are not given to those who guard you; they are allocated to the houses of top people in government.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

IT (Industrial Attachment) students can only increase their knowledge but are not licensed to practice, particularly when such students are not Medical lab scientists. Our staffs are graduates of Medical lab Science and other science researchers,\u201d Nna stated.\n\nHe noted that the company pays huge amounts of money in corporate tax, same as in the Inland Revenue, noting that such a reputable organization could not employ quacks in the outfits.\n\n\u201cWe charge the lowest rate in tests for Covid-19 because we don\u2019t see a reason why we should charge as high as others do. They approached us to make the testing rate higher but we said no, that we don\u2019t see a reason for the exploitation and the NCDC had written to us a commendation,\u201d Nna said.",

          "text": "By Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nWife of the Benue state Governor, Dr. Eunice Ortom has commenced the revival of reading culture among Benue children as she personally reads to pupils in schools in her Read Aloud initiative for Primary School Pupils.\n\nThe programme which is part of the educational intervention and annual literacy project of her Non Governmental Organization, NGO, the Eunice Spring of Life Foundation, ESLF, was flagged off at the RCM Primary School, Tse-Poor, in the outskirts of Makurdi town.\n\nMrs. Ortom who read to the pupils of the school in an interactive session, from the novel titled, \u2018The Inheritance by James Atoba, noted that reading helps children create stronger vocabulary in their learning.\n\nShe said \u201cthere are so many benefits in reading aloud to children. As children are read to, they learn new words which builds their vocabulary and communicative skills. It also builds their attention span.\n\n\u201cWhen children are read to, they build skills in listening, concentrating and paying more attention. When we read a passage or a story to children, for them to understand what is being read, they are attentive and are not noisy. It creates that bond between the reader and the listening children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has so many benefits for the children and the reader alike. It enables me the reader to learn from the children and they also learn from me. And you know that for any child to know how to read, it means that the literacy level has also increased.\n\n\u201cAnd as I do this, I also want our teachers to encourage the children to deal with their reading skills. When children are encouraged to read, they gradually and eventually develop the love for long time reading.\n\n\u201cSo it is not just about reading or encouraging children to read in the school environment. We should encourage our children to read at home and we should also find time to read stories and other educational materials to our children. They find it interesting, they are happy when they learn with us.\u201d\n\nMrs. Ortom explained that she adopted an informal setting outside the classrooms to read to the children \u201cso that we will all operate at the same level which helps the children learn different things in different context.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Head Teacher of the school, Mr. Tyolumun Anyila noted that the epoch making event would remain indelible in the minds of the pupils, staff of the school and the entire Tse-Poor community adding that it was a morale booster for the teachers to do more for the pupils.\n\nThe event which was rounded off with the donation of various educational materials to schools, by the ESLF was preceded by a spelling bee by pupils drawn from RCM Tse-Poor, NKST Primary School Yaikyo and Promise of Good International School, Tse-Poor.",

All for no fault of theirs.\n\nThe Nigerian Embassy in kuwait does not issue or renew passports and due to Covid-19 restrictions in Kuwait, airports have only be opened this October 2021 since it\u2019s closure in March 2019. So Nigerians here haven\u2019t been able to seek other alternatives.\n\n\u201cResidencies permit here are only renewed if passports have at least 1 year validity. Most people\u2019s passports are already expired or less than a year, so, effectively they are without valid residencies. Meaning they could be accosted by security officers and deported as illegals,\u201d some of the Nigerians in Kuwait said.\n\nThey however disclosed that the Nigerian Immigration officers came early July (just one person with one machine while another one joined few days after but did not come with a machine, all the way from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey captured data and we were made to believe we would get our passports within two months etc. It\u2019s four months now and no signs. If nothing is done, we may not get anything till next year\n\nIn his reaction, the consular officer at the Nigerian embassy in Kuwait, Muhammed Abdullahi Ahmed, said they embassy has been trying to help adding that it is not their fault as the problem affects all the Nigerian missions abroad.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a wrong time because the covid-19 affected all the missions abroad including Nigeria Embassy in Kuwait. The head of immigration came to Kuwait so as to assist and their data had been captured for onward processing.\n\n\u201cWhat is delaying the work is because of the number of passports they are attending to.\n\nThe immigration are working on them alphabetical on about 145 missions. All missions abroad have similar issue and the production would be marathon. Capturing is done already, issuing from Nigeria and still waiting for them.\u201d\n\nAhmed added that some of them who have been coming to the embassy are being give papers to cover for them until their passport is ready.\n\nThe embassy informed both foreign affairs headquarters about the happening, as well as embassy keep issuing letters for the affected nationals requesting and they have been persuading the host authority to bear with them for the main time.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Before we knew what was going on, they had started attacking the villagers.\n\n\u201cThe thugs started shooting indiscriminately at everyone, including schoolchildren. In the end, five people, including Matthew, sustained serious bullet wounds.\u201d\n\nWhile the bullets that were stuck in the bodies of some of the gunshot victims were later extracted and they survived, Mathew was not as lucky.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWe were told that about six people attacked him at the same time. After the attack, they escaped in the vehicle they came in.\u201d\n\nShe said that Mathew died sacrificing his life for the community, adding that the aim of the attackers was to kill or injure whoever they came across in the village.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nShe said things had been tough for the family, especially the members of Matthew\u2019s immediately family.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to the government to help us. We cannot undo what has been done. They should please release his body to us so that we can bury him,\u201d she pleaded.\n\nShe said the family had made efforts to retrieve the body, \u201cbut the police are telling us that there is a litigation so they can\u2019t release his body to us. The most unfortunate thing is that those who killed Mathew are yet to be arrested even though they are known.\u201d\n\nBut it is not only the grandmother that is in distress. The traditional ruler of Imoshe community, Chief Amusa Lawal, has also been living in fear since the three-hour invasion of the community last year.\n\nHe called on the Ogun State governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, to save his community from likely attacks in the future.\n\nGenesis of crisis\n\nPandemonium had broken out last year in Ikogbo community, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State after stray bullets killed two persons and injured several others, including schoolchildren, during a land dispute between the community and the neighbouring Imoshe. The dispute was provoked by an attempt to enforce a court judgment on the disputed land between the two communities in favour of Ikogbo.\n\nThe Onikogbo of Ikogbo, Oba Nurudeen Osoja, had invited some policemen to enforce the judgment and seal up the houses on the disputed land. But resistance from the residents forced the policemen to start shooting. In the process, a bullet hit Mathew, an okada (commercial motorcycle) rider who had just returned home from the market. Several schoolchildren and passersby were also said to have sustained bullet wounds. Matthew later died from gunshot injuries.\n\nHis corpse has since been deposited in the morgue at the General Hospital in Ota. An autopsy carried out on instruction from the office of the Inspector General of Police in Abuja was said to have revealed that the late Matthew was felled by gun bullets from the police.\n\nRemembering Matthew\n\nAt the first anniversary of the death of Matthew last week, the Baale of Imoshe presented a cash gift to his distraught mother. He said the community was marking the anniversary of his demise in order to show his family that \u201cMatthew is still part of us and he will always remains one of our heroes in Imoshe community.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIt all started around 11am on that fateful day. We saw police vans moving towards the community, but since we had no skeleton in our cupboard, we waited to receive them.\n\n\u201cBut as soon as we were told that the monarch of Ikogbo community, Oba Nurudeen Osoja, was coming with them on a motorcycle, we knew it was more than we thought, because there was an ongoing land dispute between Imoshe and his land.\n\n\u201cThe police and the blue bus did not come to my palace or that of any other chief before we started hearing gunshots from the distance. The gunshots lasted about three hours before they left.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cIkogbo people have been on our neck for a long time with claims that they are in possession of some of our forefathers\u2019 inheritance.\n\n\u201cThe courts resolved the issue but they still came back to pressurise us for what is not theirs.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to Governor Dapo Abiodun to help us. A soul has been lost and my children, Akeem and Segun Lawal, and a Hausa man were badly hit by bullets. Onikogbo of Ikogbo land should stop disturbing us.\u201d\n\nThe youth leader of Imoshe community, Hon Odunoye Kolawole Rasak said the land matters between the two communities had not been settled since September 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been instructed to provide our survey plans, which we did immediately before the ENDSARS matters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if Ikogbo has done its part, but we believe that since the air has been cleared now, we will claim our mandate.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow anyone to chase us away from our forefathers\u2019 inheritance. We are the rightful owners.\n\n\u201cWe have not heard or smelt anything from Oba Nurudeen Osoja of Ikogbo and his people since last year\u2019s attack on us. Our Baale, Chief Amusa Lawal, is a peace loving leader.\n\n\u201cWe want Governor Dapo Abiodun to assist us. We have evidence to prove that Imoshe is the rightful owner of the disputed land.\n\nOnikogbo reacts\n\nReacting to the allegations, the Baale of Ikogbo, Oba Nurudeen Osoja said: \u201cIkogbo twice got judgements on the land in contention in 1914 and in 2014 in Ota High Court.\n\n\u201cThey went on appeal in Ibadan but we still won. The first thing as a royal father is to call the attention of the government.\n\n\u201cI wrote a petition through my lawyer to the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun Awolowo, and also to the DSS to let them know what was happening.\n\n\u201cThey invited the Imoshe people but they didn\u2019t honour the invitation. Later, the Commissioner of Police directed his deputy, and he sent about 10 policemen after three days.\n\n\u201cWhen the Imoshe people sighted the police, their land grabbers and cultists attacked the policemen, our market and the police station.\n\n\u201cImoshe people were dragging guns with the policemen. That was what triggered the bullet that killed Mathew. Go to Eleweran police station to confirm.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident happened, Femi Falana called the Inspector General of Police, the IG called the CP and he mobilised his men\n\n\u201cI was the first person to call the attention of Ogun State Government to do land grabbers law in Ogun State.\n\n\u201cI am a civil engineer. I graduated from YABATECH with distinction. I have MSc in Civil Engineering. I am still practising.\u201d",

          "text": "The atmosphere in Anambra State ahead of next weekend\u2019s gubernatorial election is a mixture of anxiety, fear and hope as the governorship candidates and their parties wrap up their campaigns across the state amidst fears that the election may be disrupted by the one week stay-at-home ordered by Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), report Assistant Editor, \u2018Dare Odufowokan and Nwanosike Onu, Awka .\n\nThe tension is understandably heightening everyday as the clock ticks towards the November 6 date for the governorship election in Anambra State. The candidates in the race for the state most coveted seat on the platforms of the various political parties are gradually bringing their campaign trains to berth and setting up their various situation rooms for the last minute strategies to outdo their opponents during the electoral contest next Saturday.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEarly last month, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released the final list of candidates for the Anambra guber election, setting the stage for what many pundits are describing as an epic political showdown. While many observers of the politics of the southeast state are of the opinion that until the election is held and a winner is declared, it is impossible to predict who will carries the day, some others have narrowed the contest down to a race among four candidates and political parties.\n\nValentine Ozigbo\u2019s name was published as gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Also in the 18 candidates list published on Thursday were Prof. Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Sen. Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The list signed by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner in charge of INEC\u2019s Information and Voter Education Committee also had Sen Ifeanyi Uba as the candidate of Young Progressives Party (YPP).\n\nDr. Obiora Okonkwo would fly the flag of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Others were Obiora Agbasimalo, Labour Party; Dr. Godwin Maduka, Accord Party\u2019s; Bennet Etiaba, ( AA); Chidozie Nwankwo,( AAC); Akachukwu Nwankpo (ADC), Afam Ume-ezeoke (ADP); Geoffrey Onyejegbu (APM); Philip Echetebu (APP), Okeke Chika Jerry (BOOT Party). Leonard Ohajinkpo will contest on the platform of NNPP, Afam Ezenwafor for NRM, Nnamdi Nwawuo for PRP and Obinna Uzoh for SDP.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, the contest seems to be narrowed down among Soludo of the ruling APGA, Uba of theAPC, Ozigbo of the PDP and Ubah of the YPP, going by their current political reach across the state and the political structures they and their political parties can boast of to prosecute Saturday\u2019s governorship election. In addition, analysts are convinced that the candidates of these leading parties possess the required deep pockets and human resources to pull the rug off the feet of their competitors on Saturday.\n\nOther platforms such as the ZLP, LP and the Accord Party have shown some consistency in their campaigns and mass mobilisation ahead of the election, but analysts said the parties which are all relatively new to the people of Anambra state, lack the much the needed support base across the state to make any appreciable impact. It is also widely believe that contrary to the posturing of some of the candidates of these parties, they lack the needed financial muscles to spring any surprise at the polls.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe front-liners\n\nOne of the leading candidates in the governorship race is Senator Andy Uba, the flag bearer of APC. He hails from Uga, Aguata local government area in the South senatorial zone. He was elected governor in 2007, on the platform of the PDP, but he only lasted for 17 days in office as a result of tenure interpretation case instituted by then governor, Peter Obi. He earlier served as personal aide to former President Olusegun Obasanjo for about seven years.\n\nIn 2010, Uba was the governorship candidate of the LP losing to Peter Obi, the then incumbent governor but became the Senator for Anambra South later in 2011. He joined APC in 2017. Though his emergence as the APC candidate was controversial, it has been a harvest of political heavyweights from other political parties in the state, joining the APC to help his governorship cause. He enjoys the support of 13 APC governors. Former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan are alleged to be supporting him as well.\n\nAll the foot-soldiers of the leader of the party in the State and Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, are working for Uba. Emeka Okafor, who is Uba\u2019s deputy, and hails from Nnobi, in Idemili local government area is Ngige\u2019s cousin. Currently, Uba has the support of Senator Stella Oduah, representing Anambra North senatorial zone, having joined APC recently, Senator Joy Emodi and the member representing Onitsha North and South Federal constituency, Linda Ikpeazu, all from PDP. He has also poached some APGA members in the House of Assembly among others. The recent defection of the incumbent deputy governor of the State, Dr. Nkem Okeke of APGAhas further brightened Uba\u2019s chances.\n\nHis major weakness is the grassroots. Political observers say he plays Abuja politics more than the local politics of the state but APC is today rooted in every local government area in Anambra State because of the number of defections from APGA and PDP. Another strong contender for Obiano\u2019s seat and former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Chukwuma Soludo, the ticket bearer of the ruling APGA. Importantly, he enjoys the backing of Governor Willie Obiano and the APGA government in Anambra which has been in power for almost 16 years making it a difficult task for any political party to dislodge it easily. Besides, they always use the image of late Igbo leader, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, to promote APG as an Igbo party.\n\nSoludo hails from Isuofia, also in Aguata local government area from the same South. He had tried to govern the state on two occasions but failed in 2010 as PDP candidate and in 2013, when he aspired on the platform of APGA, but was denied the ticket. He is a member of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Economic team and heads Anambra State Vision 2050, launched by Obiano, among others. He is expected to reap from the achievements of APGA government in the state since 2006. The party\u2019s campaigns have been anchored on these.\n\nBut the choice of his running mate, Dr. Onyeka Ibezim, is viewed as an imposition on him for selfish reasons. Already, the Anglican community in the state is said to be unhappy with the choice and has thrown its weight to Uba, candidate of the APC. APGA is rooted in all the 21 local government areas in the state. This is an added advantage to Soludo\u2019 aspiration. Nevertheless, Anambra state residents seem to have become tired of APGA due to alleged abandoned projects and failed campaign promises by the incumbent administration.\n\nAlso, Soludo\u2019s emergence as the candidate of APGA brought about a yet to be resolved crisis in the party leading to the emergence of three factions. The problems had led to the mass defection of their members to APC and PDP. He has promised the residents to continue the legacy of the Obiano administration and that of APGA, if he is elected on November 6 governorship poll.\n\nValentine Ozigbo, the candidate of the PDP, is the immediate past Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Transcorp Plc. Though he is new in the murky waters of politics of the State, he has played it like a veteran so far. His emergence as the candidate of PDP was controversial like those of Uba and Soludo, but he has soldiered on. The once solid PDP has been depleted with the top guns in the party decamping to APC, thereby whittling the chances of Ozigbo at the polls.\n\nAccording to one of the chieftains who joined APC, Sir Chris Chikwelu, the PDP candidate is good and solid, but certain characters think they own the party. Though, he has repeatedly debunked having any godfather in the race, observers believe that it was former governor Peter Obi that made him the candidate of the party. Such insinuations are rife across the state, making it difficult for him to convince some opponents of the former governor to work for Ozigbo.\n\nIn less than two years since he joined politics, Ozigbo has built one of the most efficient and impactful political organisations in Nigeria, (Ka Anambra Chawapu (a better and brighter Anambra). His campaign mantra is popular at the grassroots. Analysts believe he made a fine choice in his deputy, Lady Azuka Enemo, an Anglican, a mobilizer from Onitsha, who served two terms as Commissioner for local government in Obi\u2019s government.\n\nHis major strengths in the race are his articulation, speech delivery strength and popularity of PDP in Anambra State. But what has weakened him is the division in the party. This disunity has robbed the party of electoral victories on many occasions. He has promised to harness the opportunities that abound in Anambra if elected on November 6.\n\nThe candidate of the YPP, Ifeanyi Ubah, a seating Senator representing Anambra South, is one candidate many people believe can spring a surprise in spite of the relative unpopularity of his party in the state. Though he won his current senate seat on the platform of the party, until the build up to the current governorship race, the businessman turned politician had did very little to popularize the party beyond his senatorial district.\n\n\u201cHe had his eyes on the APC governorship seat all the while. That is why he did not work hard on spreading the structures and popularity of YPP across the state. It was only when he realized he could not snatch the APC ticket that he reversed to the use of YPP. Now not many people in other parts of the state can relate with the party. What he has going for him is his on personal popularity. He is well known in Anambra as a businessman, sports promoter and politician,\u201d a source explained.\n\nUbah says security will be a major focus if he is elected. \u201cOn the security situation in my state, I have a different method that I am going to apply. I am going to apply information technology and information gathering to solve many problems. My constituency asked me to go and see how I can proffer political solution to issues that surround Nnamdi Kanu. I will do that if elected,\u201d he said.\n\nThreats and pleas\n\nDespite fresh threat by proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will go on with the poll as scheduled. IPOB had last weekend declared a one week sit-at-home protest across the South-East states starting from November 5, the eve of the governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nIPOB\u2019s Media and Public Secretary, Emma Powerful, in a statement in Awka, the Anambra State capital, said the protest was aimed at prevailing on the Federal Government to release its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. The group vowed that the protest would go on as planned if Kanu was not released before November 4. Kanu is facing trial on a seven-count amended charge bordering on treason and terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Simon Ekpa, one of Kanu\u2019s supporters and a prominent leader in IPOB, via his social media handles, again warned INEC against conducting any election in the Southeast. He said \u201ctell Egbunike and others to stay away from Anambra election as Biafrans already decided there will be no movement or election in Anambra State on the 6th of November, 2021.\n\n\u201cDIG Egbunike should be ready to go down in the history as the policeman used by the Fulanis to instigate crises should in case he tries to enforce election in Anambra State by killing any Biafran.\u201d The IPOB leader who is supposedly based in Finland, said, reiterating the earlier directive for residents of Anambra to stay indoor on election day.\n\nBut the commission said it would move into the state this week for the final lap of preparations for the election. INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, stated the commission\u2019s stand at a special meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES). Yakubu said: \u201cINEC is determined to proceed with the Anambra State governorship election, as scheduled.\n\n\u201cThe safety and protection of voters, our personnel, accredited observers, the media and materials are cardinal considerations in any election. We have been assured by the security agencies of a secure environment for the election. Members of ICCES may recall that three weeks ago, we held an emergency meeting to review preparations for the Anambra State governorship election. Since then, so much has been achieved and our preparations for the election have been going on unhindered.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 Anambra State governorship election is holding on November 6, 2021. Our deployment of non-sensitive materials and training of personnel for the election have virtually been concluded. The commission has successfully accomplished 12 out of the 14 activities listed in the timetable and schedule of activities for the election released in January this year.\n\n\u201cThe two outstanding activities are the last day of campaign, at midnight on Thursday, November 4, 2021, and Election Day, which remains Saturday, November 6, 2021. The REC for Anambra State is here to fully provide an update on the implementation of other activities and INEC\u2019s general state of readiness for the election.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, has appealed to the IPOB to suspend its planned sit-at-home order. Commenting on the development, Chiedozie Ogbonnia, Ohanaeze spokesperson, said \u201cthe lockdown may disrupt the election and cause untold hardship for the people in the south-east. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide pleads with the IPOB to reconsider the 7 days\u2019 sit-at-home order in the south-east of Nigeria from November 5 to November 11.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the governorship election for Anambra State scheduled for November 6 to hold. It is important to note that Anambra state is the economic live wire of the south-east with an impressive steady growth trajectory. For instance, Anambra state showcases the best rural road network and rural community development in the south-east if not in entire Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnambra is home to the greatest number of small, medium and large scale industries in the south-east. Most recently, Anambra has added a cargo airport to its resource base. Above all, Onitsha is the largest market in West Africa. The implication of the above illustration is that Anambra state is the melting pot of Igbo traders and artisans. It stands to reason that Anambra is the big Iroko tree that provides a shade for most Igbos.\n\n\u201cApart from the shade, it also hosts the numerous birds that perch on the branches. Therefore any harm to the Iroko tree will create untold disastrous chain reactions and catastrophe for the Igbo.\n\nTight security\n\nIt was also gathered that President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered service chiefs to ensure that nothing is allowed to stop the Anambra governorship election from holding. According to Babagana Monguno, National Security Adviser, the president gave the order in response to the heightened security challenges in Anambra.\n\n\u201cThe president has directed that under no circumstances will anything be allowed to stop the elections from taking place successfully. The people have a right to vote and select their leader. The president has made it very clear that the armed forces and all law enforcement agencies must make sure that the elections take place, even if it means overwhelming the entire environment with the presence of security agencies.\n\n\u201cThere are so many implications for elections to be sabotaged by non-state actors. In the first place, we are in a democracy; secondly, it is important to note that if these non-state actors should succeed in destroying the potentials for orderly elections, then it is natural that other parts of the country would also want to copy this same situation,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice authorities also assured that the election will hold amidst adequate security across the state. Maigari Dingyadi, Minister of Police Affairs, said the force is ready to ensure peace in Anambra and other parts of the country. \u201cThe election has to be free and fair. We are going to put every machinery in place to ensure that people are well secured. That is the only way to ensure that we promote democracy and good governance in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nConsequently, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba has ordered the deployment of adequate officers to the state. Force spokesperson, Frank Mba, said Deputy Inspector General of Police, Joseph Egbunike, has been deployed to Anambra State as the Coordinator of the security component for the elections.\n\n\u201cDIG Egbunike is saddled with the responsibility of overseeing the implementation of the Operation Order evolved from the Election Security Threat Assessment, to ensure a peaceful environment devoid of violence and conducive enough to guarantee that law-abiding citizens freely perform their civic responsibilities without molestation or intimidation.\n\n\u201cDIG Egbunike will be assisted by the DIG in-charge of Operations, Acting DIG Zaki Ahmed. Other strategic commanders deployed to Anambra State include five (5) Assistant Inspectors General of Police (AIGs), fourteen (14) Commissioners of Police (CPs), thirty-one (31) Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) and forty-eight (48) Assistant Commissioners of Police (ACPs).\n\n\u201cThe Senior Officers are to coordinate human and other operational deployments in the three (3) Senatorial Districts, twenty-one (21) Local Government Areas and the 5720 polling units in Anambra State. The IGP reassures the nation that the Force is adequately prepared for the Gubernatorial Elections in Anambra State come November 6th, 2021,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Chief Olukunle Akinola (FRICS, FNIS), the first Surveyor-General and Coordinating Director Lands/Survey Services of Lagos State will turn 90 today. In this interview with GBENGA ADERANTI , Akinola talks about life as a surveyor, secrets of his longevity, family and why he is still able go to work at 90.\n\nYou grew up in Lagos. I want you to compare the Lagos of that time and the Lagos of today.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nI was born in Ipaja now under Alimosho Local Government Area. Then it was in Ikeja Local Government, which was under the then Western Region. From the school, we used to come to Ikeja for Empire Day. I started my school at Ipaja; after elementary school, I went to CMS Grammar School in Lagos. I stayed there for six years. Then, secondary school was six years. In 1951, the government said it should be five years. We did six years and when we came out, we were known as old boys of Group 51 -6. Those behind us spent five years.\n\nAfter that I served in Lagos for six years. I\u2019ve always been connected to Lagos.\n\nI went for further training at the Federal School of Surveying, Oyo, all in the Western Region. Thereafter, I was posted to Western Region; under Western Region, I had further education. I went to South-West Essex Technical College, London, Japan and so on\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhen I finished, I was transferred to Ikeja Local Government; probably because Ipaja was in Ikeja Local Government. They transferred me to the Survey Department in Ikeja; it was then that Lagos State was created and I opted to stay in Lagos State. We were asked whether we would stay with the new state or go back to the Western Region. Since then, I\u2019ve been in Lagos.\n\nAt 90, you still remember date, time and events vividly; what is the secret?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is not easy. I know I was born in 1931. I know I entered primary school in 1939. I know I left grammar school in \u201951 and I spent six years in grammar school. I could calculate, I entered grammar school in \u201945 and came out in \u201951. I spent about four years doing survey work. You are right, it is not easy to remember those days, but don\u2019t forget that I\u2019m a surveyor and we deal in numbers. I know that we spent four years in the Nigerian college and in 1961, I travelled to London, and others followed. When I retired for example, I retired to set up a private practice. I continued to use figures and figures until now that the new technology has taken everything. If you are not engaged with what is going on now, you will be abandoned. That is why you cannot easily forget figures in our profession.\n\nWhen you were growing up, courses like medicine, law and education were popular, why did you opt for surveying?\n\nWe had people who came out of Ipaja who were surveyors, like Mr. Ogunbiyi. He was licensed to practice surveying. I could see that he enjoyed going into the bush; and in surveying then, you would go into the bush to demarcate boundaries. Wherever land needed to be surveyed, you would go there. Also my father was a farmer, and during the holiday, I would go to the farm with him. I enjoyed it. We would trek from Ipaja to wherever the farm was and because of that, I loved going into the bush. So I love to do survey work, I love \u2018bush work\u2019.\n\nLand matters are a serious matter. Was there any point in time your life was threatened while doing this job?\n\nWell, like you have now, the omo oniles. When the government said they acquire this or that, they called surveyors, \u2018go and demarcate.\u2019 And you must go with very heavy equipment to carry out the survey work. The people may not like it, but when the government announces a gazette, you must know what you want to gazette, and so you must call a surveyor that will demarcate and prepare a plan. However, when you go to the bush, the hostility is there; people who own the land would not allow you to enter their land for any purpose. I had one or two cases. I had led my team to do survey work; people who claimed to own the land seized our equipment and beat the labourers; we called people working with us labourers; and they had to abandon the job and go and report at the office that we were not allowed to do the job. Then they equipped us with security people who confronted the landowners.\n\nIt has always been there. But thank God, I never lost anybody. Even the equipment they seized was returned. However, these days, I don\u2019t think it is as bad as that because they don\u2019t carry chains anymore. They may not enter the bush now, as we were doing. It is easy with the equipment that they have now.\n\nYou spoke about Group-51-6, CMS Grammar School. How do you feel when you see your mates now?\n\n(Prolonged laughter) \u2026 The question is how many of them are remaining now. 1951? That was when we left grammar school. We were of different ages 20, 21\u2026. Some of us are still alive though. One of them is Mr. Segun Bako. He is about 80; Henry Odukomaya too. Those of us who are alive ask ourselves, \u2018how many are remaining? (Laughter again) I\u2019m just one of them. About three of us, I can remember, are remaining now.\n\nTalking about those of you remaining; are you saying that you sometimes think about death?\n\nOf course, you come and you go. We came to the world and we are going to leave the world. You can go anytime. The Bible says our age is 70 or so.\n\nDo you sometimes feel you would have done better in other professions outside surveying?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. When you are able to train yourself in a profession, you equip yourself with the knowledge. When you get into a profession and you get promoted every time and you are not frustrated and you are enjoying what you are doing, what else do you want?\n\nYou are not cheated, you are getting what you deserve, you go to work, you get the result you want and you\u2019re not discouraged. What else do you want?\n\nLike you said, Medicine is there, Accounting is there, and many others; you choose your own and follow it up; and when time comes, you leave it. I enjoyed my own because I was lucky to be almost on top all the time. For example, I left Lagos as the First Lagos State Surveyor-General. When I was transferred to Ikeja, I met some senior officers there but when we were separated, I was the one in charge of Lagos State. When I left Lagos State to be on my own, I had gotten to where I wanted to get to in the profession.\n\nTalking about luck, all your six children are doing very well in their different professions. How did you meet your wife and what kind of training did you give to your children?\n\nWell, I\u2019m a Christian; my wife is also a Christian. When our children were growing up, we put them in the Christian way we also lived. When they got out, we encouraged them to follow whatever line of profession they wanted. One of my children is an engineer, the other one loved medicine and he followed it up. Thank God, he is a professor of medicine now. We never dictated to any of them that this is what they should do. When they passed out of their elementary secondary, they chose where they wanted to go and we encouraged them.\n\nSo none of them showed interest in surveying?\n\nThey were not interested. As I told you, it is bush work. The one I convinced to do survey couldn\u2019t do it, he failed on the way. However, I have a grandson who did survey; he is outside the country now.\n\nBy the estimation of that time, you could have married more than one wife if you wanted to, why did you choose to be a monogamist?\n\nMy father was a Christian. He was a lay reader, Anglican mostly married with only one wife. When I got married there was nothing in my mind to say I must marry more than one wife.\n\nThank God, the one I had was doing fine. We disagree to agree, our children were doing fine, and there was nothing of interest to make me marry more than one wife.\n\nYou are a traditional title holder in Ipaja. Do you still participate actively in the events of your community?\n\nAt my age now, I don\u2019t; but when the new oba celebrated his first 100 days in office, we went there to participate. I still participate in some of the things they do. They come for advice but not like in the past when we would go, discuss, spend time on what would be the future for Ipaja. Now if they want anything, they would tell us to advise, which we always do.\n\nWhat has life taught you?\n\nNever leave till tomorrow what you can do today. A stitch in time saves nine. This has been guiding us. If you have a purpose in life, you follow it. I\u2019m a Christian, whatever they say we should do, I do. I follow up church activities. Life continues. Plan your life as you want it to be. I wanted to be a surveyor and I did survey work. I knew I couldn\u2019t be a businessman. Do whatever you can do. Satisfy your conscience and live a life that will make you happy. And when you\u2019re happy, everything you do will lead you to a good life.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI do sporting activities, it helps me. When I was in Oyo, I played lawn tennis. When I was in the UK, I did the same thing. I engage myself in sports; I\u2019m still a member of Ikeja Club. I\u2019m one of their trustees. When I was still very active, I played table tennis and lawn tennis there.\n\nYou said you engage in sporting activities. Could this be the reason you\u2019re still alive and strong?\n\nMaybe, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t drink but I exercise. It is part of a long life also. Don\u2019t just sit down thinking and thinking. When you go out, you talk to people; this helps a lot.\n\nAt my age, I still love to go to the club. I still play darts to exercise. That is keeping me going. At my age I can\u2019t run, but I can throw darts, pick come go and record. It makes your brain work because it has to do with figures.\n\nI still go to work. Going to work is one of those things that have continued to keep me going.",

          "text": "The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire has disclosed that the Federal Government is earnestly developing local preventive and treatment remedies for cancer and other ailments.\n\nHe stated that it is working with institutes like the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD) on research and development of these local remedies.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is the second (after cardiovascular diseases) leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020.\n\nBreast cancer is the commonest cancer in women and Prostate cancer in Men. In Nigeria, breast cancer is the commonest cancer followed by cervical cancer in women with estimated 26 per 100,000 population new cases occurring every year.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSpeaking during the 28th Annual Live Above Poverty Organization (LAPO) Development Forum in Abuja. With the theme: \u2018Promoting Community-Based Cancer Control Programme in Nigeria,\u2019 Dr Ehanire explained that early detection and treatment culminates to reducing morbidity and mortality and socioeconomic impacts in all the communities across the country.\n\nRepresented by the Director of the Department of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the Federal Ministry of Health, Pharm Zainab Shariff, he said: \u201cOrthodox, complementary and alternative medicines are recognised by WHO. Nigeria must begin to look into its own indigenous flora and fauna, and that is what we are doing.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIn our communities are god-given agents in terms of medicinal plants for the treatment of human beings in terms of ailment. We are trying to research with institutes like NIPRD to be able to discover and have medicines for the benefits of our people. We cannot continue to rely on importing everything if we continue to do that we have nothing to save. COVID-19 is an example.\n\n\u201cCancer treatment is holistic. Curative is not alone; preventive and the use of supportive therapies. Supportive therapies in terms of improving healthy lifestyles, good nutrition and organic foods that are there in the community.\n\n\u201cWith this, we will be able to achieve universal health coverage. Curative is not the only way to go, God has blessed us and let us use that.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the occasion and former President of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, said: \u201cThe reason for the high burden of cancer in Africa and Nigeria is that most times, maybe due to late detection and referral for treatment, poor access to treatment, thus account for the high mortality rate in poorer countries. These delays in diagnosis and proper referrals leads to a situation where a high percentage of cancer cases arrive at the point of treatment at advanced stages of the disease when it is difficult to recover from or even manage.\n\n\u201cI believe that LAPO Community Campaign for Cancer Control (LAPO C4) was born out of the need to galvanize people and resources around the critical issue of early detection of cancer as well as its proper management and treatment.\u201d\n\nThe Founder/Chief Executive Officer of LAPO, Dr. Godwin Ehigiamusoe, explained that the LAPO forum is not only for advocacy, but a melting pot for stakeholders to discuss, make recommendations, and proffer workable solutions in agriculture, health, economy, gender equity, etc., to bring about development in Nigeria and Africa.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nSupporters of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Bauchi governor, Bala Mohammed; former Kano governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso; and other northern Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders yesterday took over the Eagle Square, Abuja, venue of the national convention of the party, to drum support for the presidential ambitions of their principals.\n\nThis is as the opposition party elected its national officers, most of who were returned unopposed.\n\nBasking on the euphoria of the large gathering, Chairman of the PDP National Convention Organizing Committee, Ahmadu Fintiri, while declaring open the 2021 Convention, said that it is the starting point in PDP\u2019s quest to rescue the country from alleged misgovernance of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nFintiri, who is also the governor of Adamawa State, said that Nigerians still relish the 16 years the PDP controlled the reins of power in the country.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe governor noted that the fortunes of the country have allegedly dwindled under the APC-led Federal Government.\n\nConsequently, he stated that the citizens were looking unto the opposition party to rescue the country in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfor Nigeria, the present APC-led government is hell-bent on railroading the country into multifaceted recession in all fronts; from the economy to governance; national security to diplomacy; poverty to unemployment; anti-corruption to the observance of the rule of law; citizenship to national cohesion, etc. Indeed, the country has never had it this bad.\n\n\u201cThat Nigeria is better by far with PDP in power is not in doubt. That the people relish on those golden moments when the PDP held sway at the centre is not in doubt. That citizens are yearning for the return of PDP at the centre as the 2023 elections draw nearer, is equally not in doubt.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, have a duty not to disappoint our teaming supporters. We have to take back our country as we have always done. We have to save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf we could force the country out of the clutches of the military, we can do this one huge task \u2013 push the people who don\u2019t know the true definition of good governance and national coexistence out of power. This is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 National Convention, presents a starting point for the Nigeria rescue mission. I commend the decision of all the organs of the party, especially the BoT and NEC for recognizing that the party has a beautiful chance to reinvent itself with this convention.\u201d\n\nFintiri noted that the outcome of the convention would have a direct bearing on the strength of the PDP as it moves into the future.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the choices before us have been made easier by the power of consensus which is an integral part of our processes.\n\n\u201cThat most of the positions have emerged with single contestants is not only a pointer to our bond of familyhood, but a demonstration of our entrenched democratic culture and strength as a party determined to soldier on in unison,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn his part, the acting national chairman of the PDP, Yemi Akinwonmi, while declaring the convention open, charged aggrieved members of the party to bury the hatchet and close ranks, in the overall interest of the party.\n\nAkinwonmi stated that there was need for the PDP leaders to put the interest of the opposition party and the country above their personal interests.\n\n\u201cI am personally happy to associate myself with the winning party in the coming 2023 election. I call on all members of this party to come together, bury our personal, individual and collective differences and put PDP and interest of Nigeria above any consideration,\u201d the PDP chairman stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From John Adams, Minna\n\nTroops of the Nigerian Army and gunmen were engaged in a heavy gunfire on Friday night at Pandogari community in Rafi Local Government area of Niger State.\n\nA source at Pandogari community told Sunday Sun that about 100 heavily armed men, three each on motorcycles attempted to storm the town to kill and rustle cattle when they met stiff resistance from the soldiers and members of the local vigilantes.\n\nThe gunmen suspected to be fleeing Zamfara and Katsina states due to the military operations going on there, invaded the town at about 6:00 pm on Friday, and made their way straight to the military base in an attempt to first of all sack the soldiers, but met fully prepared Nigerian soldiers who engaged them in a fierce gun battle.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nAccording to our source, the soldiers engaged the gunmen for several hours and later called for reinforcement, which promptly arrived.\n\nOur source further disclosed that in less than one hour, no fewer than 20 trucks from Kagara loaded with armed soldiers and another 10 trucks from Birnin Gwari arrived Pandogari, and overwhelmed the gunmen who quickly retreated to the Allawa forest.\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen suffered heavy casualties as there were bloodstains and some of their belongings seen everywhere in the bush on Saturday morning. They, however, managed to evacuate the dead and the injured ones.\n\nA top local vigilante official, who spoke to Sunday Sun on condition of anonymity, described the battle as \u201cvery intense and serious.\u201d\n\nHe praised the gallantry displayed by the soldiers, and equally commended the military authority for the quick response to the troops. He said that despite the reinforcement, the soldiers later resulted in the use of rocket-propelled grenades and other sophisticated weapons due to a large number of gunmen. The strategy devastated the gunmen and made them retreat into the forest.\n\nThe vigilante official said from the look of the gunmen \u201cthey were Fulani who are very young but not from Nigeria because of their mode of dressing and their intonation,\u201d which he pointed out was completely different from the Fulani in Nigeria.\n\nHe further hinted that the gunmen might likely come back to engage the soldiers because the presence of the military and the local vigilantes had blocked all their routes and were finding it difficult to operate in the area.\n\n\u201cThe bandits were equally looking for a base in the state because of the military operations in Zamfara and Katsina states. They have been dislodged there so they are desperately looking for a base in Niger state,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane confirmed the story, adding \u201cwhat the security men did was to repel the attack.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nNothing scares actress and entrepreneur, Moyo Lawal, more than bringing children into the world to suffer.\n\nIndeed, she abhors poverty and irresponsibility. For this, she has vowed never to start a family without proper planning.\n\nIn this interview, pretty and voluptuous Moyo Lawal opened up on her celibate years, reasons she\u2019s still single and her need for a crazy lover. Please enjoy it.\n\nCan you forgive and take back a cheating partner?\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nI don\u2019t see my man cheating as a big deal. What I don\u2019t like is don\u2019t come and be pretending that you are holier than thou, and don\u2019t neglect your duties. Just cheat with sense and use protection.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on people bringing their private relationship matters on social media?\n\nI am of the opinion that we are all wired differently. You can put whatever you want on the Internet so far you are ready to deal with the consequences.\n\nYou\u2019re such a beautiful lady, why are you still single?\n\nLet us go and ask God \u2018biko\u2019. I am beautiful? Eeeh, thank you!\n\nDo you think your career is one of the reasons you\u2019re not married yet?\n\nIt was more because before I started my skincare business a couple of years ago, I didn\u2019t have a stable income. Even though I was working regularly as an actor, I couldn\u2019t actually make a budget for the year. So, I wasn\u2019t ready to start a family without being able to plan properly. Nothing terrifies me more than bringing children into this world to suffer.\n\nWhat has stardom deprived you of?\n\nStardom almost deprived me of an opportunity to have a regular life, but when I started my business, I became a regular person. So, nobody can use stardom to blackmail me again (laughs).\n\nWhat prompted your decision to go celibate?\n\nCelibate? That was years ago. First, sex before marriage is still a sin, and if I am sinning, it has to count. I can\u2019t be sinning like I am eating. Two, I was waiting for Mr. Right. But now they say there is no such thing. If you follow my posts, you will notice this trend at some point. So, I started talking about following the crowd, because if you can\u2019t beat them, you join them!\n\nWhat is your best sex position?\n\nBest sex position? If I tell you, what will you do with it?\n\nWhat makes you happy?\n\nFor me, happiness is taking care of my responsibilities, making people happy and meeting my daily targets.\n\nHow affordable are your beauty products and how do you source for your ingredients?\n\nMy beauty products \u2013 Fierceglow Skincare \u2013 are very affordable and can be bought online for now. Most of our ingredients are organic, handmade with love and are sourced locally.\n\nWhat turns you off in a relationship?\n\nLies! What is new under the sun? Don\u2019t just be a hypocrite or people-pleaser, and we will not have issues.\n\nHow do you react to rumours that you and Jackie are entangled in a romantic affair with a certain married politician in Abuja?\n\nI am single, so I am at liberty to do anything I want. But please, let us stick to the truth. I can beat my chest anywhere that I have been better behaved. It has not been easy; I have had years that I abstained completely [from sex]. Do you think with that kind of self-control, I still won\u2019t have sense than most regular girls and even some married women?\n\nWhat are those qualities you look out for in a potential husband?\n\nFor me, husband material is definitely someone who has sense and empathy. He\u2019s someone who treats the waiter like a colleague, who has deep family values, but not society driven. Then, he has to be crazy to a very large extent.\n\nWhat would make you marry a much older lover?\n\nOlder lover? If he ticks my list, why not? I think it might even be easier for me because marriage is a job you have to be willing to work on, for the rest of your life. Hence, if he is much older, it might be a lot more easier; respecting his decisions and trusting him not to lead us astray because he has lived many lifetimes.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "To also participate in Paris peace summit\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is expected to depart Abuja on Sunday for Glasgow, Scotland to attend the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nThe President, in a release by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, is scheduled to deliver his national statement at the High-Level segment for Heads of State and Government at the conference on Tuesday, November 2.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s address is expected to highlight Nigeria\u2019s key priorities and action to tackle climate change as well as progress on the country\u2019s transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nThe conference, being hosted by the United Kingdom in partnership with Italy, will bring parties together to help accelerate action towards the Paris Agreement as well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nGiven Nigeria\u2019s leading role in taking climate action and as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, COP 26 will afford a unique opportunity for the Nigerian delegation to work with other parties to make progress on the main goals of the conference including securing global net zero by mid-century and keeping 1.5C within reach; adapting to protect communities and natural habitats as well as mobilising the much needed finances to meet the set targets.\n\nIn Glasgow, President Buhari will participate in some side-line events hosted by US President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe President will be accompanied by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; National Security Adviser, Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd) and Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Ahmed Rufai Abubakar.\n\nPresident Buhari will thereafter travel to Paris, France on an official visit to reciprocate an earlier one to Nigeria by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and also attend the Paris Peace forum 2021, the fourth edition to be hosted by the French President.\n\nIt will have Heads of State and Government and CEOs of major multinationals, as well as several civil society actors, gathering to advance concrete solutions to the enormous challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to improve global governance in times of COVID-19.\n\nThe Summit will focus on spurring a more solid and inclusive recovery by addressing the various gaps in global governance, offering initiatives to better tend to the global commons, and putting forward new principles of action for the post-COVID world.\n\nWhile the President is in Paris, the Nigerian government will organize the Nigeria-Paris Forum. The event is expected to pull a crowd of Nigerian and French investors, government and business leaders, diplomats and the media in the hope of showcasing opportunities on both sides as well as bringing enlightenment to bear on the prevailing security, economic and investment climate in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari is expected back in the country after the engagements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Prospects of southern presidential candidate brighten as Ayu emerges national chair\n\n\u2022Party inaugurates new NWC members December 9\n\n\u2022Atiku, Tambuwal, Saraki\u2019s loyalists flood venue with presidential campaign posters\n\nBy Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nWith the successful conduct of a peaceful convention and strong cohesion among its various organs and chieftains, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday kicked off the process of retaking power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe emergence of a former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu as the new National Chairman of the party from the National Convention held yesterday in Abuja, has also brightened the prospects of southern Nigeria to produce the presidential candidate of the party in 2023.\n\nAt the Eagle Square, Abuja venue of the convention, party chieftains such as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Chairman of the party\u2019s convention committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Mr. Ahmadu Fintiri; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; and Chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal spoke glowingly on the party\u2019s chances to retake power in 2023.\n\nThe party affirmed Ayu; the National Secretary, Senator Samuel Daddy Anyanwu, and others as the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who will be inaugurated on December 9 this year.\n\nThe main opposition party will also amend its constitution after the new Electoral Act is signed into law.\n\nChairman of the party\u2019s convention committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Fintiri, who disclosed the affirmation yesterday at the venue of the convention, said the convention was aimed at rescuing Nigeria from the bad governance of the APC.\n\nAyu and Anyanwu were affirmed as national chairman and national secretary following their nomination through consensus.\n\nAyu was nominated by the North-central, while Anyanwu was nominated by the South-east and both candidates were unopposed at the convention.\n\nAs at press time last night, only two offices were being contested for at the convention, as other contestants for the position of National Auditor stepped down for Mr. Sam Ben Nwosu late last night.\n\nThe office of the Deputy National Chairman (South) was being contested by a former national secretary of PDP, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former deputy national chairman of the party in the South-west, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja.\n\nThe office of the Youth Leader was also being contested.\n\nThe zoning committee of the party headed by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State had zoned the office of the national chairman to the North.\n\nTraditionally, when the national chairman emerges from the North, the presidential candidate of the party will emerge from the South and vice versa.\n\nThe emergence of Ayu from the North as the national chairman has raised hopes for a possible emergence of a southerner as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe development has also brightened the prospects of a southerner succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari as the APC is also favourably disposed to field a southern presidential candidate.\n\nGovernors Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State; Babagana Zulum of Borno State; Darius Ishaku of Taraba State; Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State; Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State \u2013 all elected on the platform of the ruling party, as well as Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State (PDP), among others, had all expressed their preference for power to shift to the South.\n\nHowever, the venue of the PDP convention was flooded with the presidential campaign posters of a former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso; former Vice President Atiku; former Senate President, Saraki; Bauchi State governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; his Sokoto State counterpart, Tambuwal, and former governor of Bauchi State, Adamu Muazu.\n\nMeanwhile, Fintiri said that Ayu and other members of the PDP would be sworn in on December 9 this year, to enable the outgoing NWC members to complete their tenure of four years, having been elected and sworn in on December 9, 2017.\n\nHe said the party is aimed at rescuing Nigeria from the pangs of the maladministration it has been plunged into in the past few years.\n\nFintiri said since the APC was elected in 2015, the testimony of those who jumped into the party\u2019s ship is a telltale of how things have worsened in the land.\n\n\u201cThe political mutation of the party over the years has seen a few of foundational members veering off sometimes. The confessions of most of those who sojourned to any other party in the country are loaded with regrets. Most of them are lucky to stage a comeback and as a magnanimous family, we are always glad to receive them with all privileges, back into our folds.\n\n\u201cFor those, who are still contemplating a return, but are held back by any other force less than Nigeria, I call on you to break the force and return to where you rightly belong. It is time to rescue Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cWe have always been there for Nigeria at its perilous time of need. We are not just a vehicle for winning elections but a symbolism of a free, democratic, and prosperous Nigeria that works for every citizen. We have demonstrated our commitment to these time-tested ideals that Nigerians have every reason to trust us enough more than a contraption that was formed solely to win the election and around the personal ambitions of certain individuals bereft of the knowledge of what to do with the victory,\u201d Fintiri explained.\n\nThe Adawama State governor said Nigerians are yearning for the return of the party, particularly at the centre in 2023.\n\n\u201cThat the people relish those golden moments when the PDP held sway at the centre is not in doubt. That citizens are yearning for the return of PDP at the centre as the 2023 elections draw nearer, is equally not in doubt.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore have a duty not to disappoint our teeming supporters. We have to take back our country as we have always done. We have to save Nigeria. If we could force the country out of the clutches of the military, we can do this one huge task-push the people who don\u2019t know the true definition of good governance and national co-existence out of power.\n\n\u201cThis is a Nigeria rescue mission. This is the role PDP was invented to play.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 national convention, presents a starting point for the Nigeria rescue mission,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that 34 candidates indicated interests in various national positions in the party, out of which 28 were cleared, two withdrew voluntarily while four were disqualified.\n\nFintiri said that there were 21 positions to be contested for and a total of 3,600 delegates to elect the officials.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis convention will also not allow us to make and adopt amendments to our constitution. This is because we are foreseeing a need for more amendments after the new Electoral Act passed by the National Assembly is signed into law.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore deferring the votes on constitutional amendments to a special convention to be held on any convenient date to be decided by the NEC.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Senate Minority Leader, Senator. Enyinnaya Abaribe noted that Nigeria was going through difficult moments.\n\nOn his part, the outgoing national secretary of PDP, Senator Umar Tsuari said that the party encountered several challenges during their tenure.\n\nAlso speaking, the acting national chairman of the party, Mr. Yemi Akinwonmi, called on party members to \u201ccome together, bury our personal, individual and collective differences and put PDP and the interest of Nigeria above any consideration.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu described the convention of the party as the engine for a new beginning\n\nHe said Nigerians are yearning for freedom from the suppressive, incompetent, cold-blooded, arrogant, treasury looting and anti-people APC.\n\nWe Have a Chance to Set the Ship Aright, Says Atiku\n\nAddressing the delegates and party officials, former Vice President Atiku charged all Nigerians to take the opportunity presented by the PDP to set Nigeria aright.\n\nHe said that the convention is an opportunity to make decisions that would shape the future of the party for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\nAtiku said Nigeria was passing through the most difficult period of its existence, saying that he is over 70 years and had never seen the country in such a shape.\n\nHe said there was so much insecurity and social tension which were threatening the unity and corporate existence of the country.\n\nPDP is Winning Despite Distractions, Says Tambuwal\n\nAlso speaking at the convention, the Chairman of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Sokoto State, Tambuwal expressed optimism that the party is set to reclaim its glory.\n\nAccording to Tambuwal, despite the antics of detractors to roll back the 16 years\u2019 impressive credentials of the party, the party is still at the forefront and endearing.\n\n\u201cAnalysts and observers agreed that there are attempts to scuttle our unity as a party and as a people.

          "title": "In Ordering Investigation, FG Denies Involvement in Raid on Justice Odili\u2019s Residence",
          "text": "\u2022Atiku, NBA, SANs, PANDEF, others seek prosecution of invaders\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday exonerated his ministry from the invasion of the residence of a Supreme Court judge, Justice Mary Odili in Abuja, and ordered a full investigation into the matter.\n\nOver 50 officers suspected operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and members of the Joint Panel Recovery unit of the Federal Ministry of Justice, had in Friday evening, invaded the house of the senior justice located at Imo River Street, Maitama.\n\nThe security officials claimed they were executing a court warrant to search the house.\n\nThe warrant was procured from the Federal Capital Territory Chief Magistrate Court by one CSP Lawrence Ajodo, who claimed to be attached to the Joint Panel Recovery of the Ministry of Justice.\n\nBut Chief Magistrate Emmanuel A. Iyanna had late Friday revoked the order of the court for the search of Odili\u2019s residence, saying the order was based \u201cupon misrepresentation\u201d of facts.\n\nShortly after the invasion was made public, the anti-graft agency through its spokesperson, Mr. Wilson Uwujiaren, denied the involvement of its operatives in the raid.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and some Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) yesterday condemned in strong terms the invasion and called for the investigation and subsequent prosecution of alleged perpetrators.\n\nThe NBA president Mr. Olumide Akpata specifically described the invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s residence as an \u201caffront\u201d on the judiciary.\n\nBut Malami, in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu said he \u201cwas not in any way connected with the fabrications and concocted lies linking him to the ensued imbroglio relating to news stories about the residence of a Justice of the Supreme Court; Justice Mary Odili\u201d.\n\nHe said the clarification to debunk the mischievous publication became imperative given the media hype and the dimension the story is taking.\n\n\u201cIt is important to set the record straight that as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, Malami will not stoop too low to be associated with an apparent in-elegant and nasty court process on the strength of which the purported search warrant was procured\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nAccording to Malami, the media reports on the issue depict a too untidy process that could never emanate from the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\n\u201cThe general public needs to know that there was nothing called Joint Panel Recovery under the Ministry of Justice in the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and by extension the entire Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is Assets Recovery and Management Unit, the mandate of which does not include stings operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister maintained that numerous incongruities in the documents being circulated about the saga revealed traces of criminal actions with particular regards to: \u201cThe name as contained on the purported letter headed paper \u201cGhost\u2019s Account For Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Tax Recovery Panel, the ambiguous reference to Ministry of Justice without clarifying as to whether it is Federal or State Ministry and of which state, the claimed office address which as revealed by the letter headed paper is not the address of the Federal Ministry of Justice and the email address used on the letter.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, all these deductions would have assisted a discerning mind to arrive at a reasonable conclusion of criminal undertones associated with the court process based on which the purported search warrant was procured.\n\nThe statement added that the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice had since reached out to the relevant authorities for an intensified wider investigation on the matter for necessary actions leading to the prosecution of anyone involved in the matter because the only names on record from the process filed in court are a purported police officer who claimed to be \u201cO/C Assets Recovery Team\u201d and one Aliyu Umar, a deponent in the affidavit.\n\n\u201cThe claim of the Chief Magistrate as reported by a section of the media to the effect that he was being misled by the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice into the issuance of the search warrant is equally forwarded to the relevant investigative agencies to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the purported association of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and which officer if any in the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is associated with such claimed misrepresentation\u201d, he said.\n\nThe Chief Magistrate, Iyanna, had on Friday night revoked the search warrant, claiming he was misled by the government.\n\nIyanna had issued the search warrant on October 29, 2021, to the Joint Panel Recovery unit of the Federal Ministry of Justice to enable the panel to search Justice Peter-Odili\u2019s home.\n\nOne Lawrence Ajodo, a Chief Superintendent of Police, who was said to be a member of the panel had asked the court for the warrant to investigate alleged illegal activities reported to be taking place in the house by one whistleblower, Aliyu Umar.\n\nThe spokesman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Wilson Uwujaren had on Friday distanced the agency from the invasion and advised members of the public to disregard any news to the contrary.\n\nHowever, reacting to the situation via a statement yesterday, Akpata said the association will hold a meeting with heads of \u201crelevant\u201d security agencies to get more information on the issue.\n\nHe said the fact that the EFCC and Malami have denied their involvement in the operation, \u201csuggests the inference that the residence of the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria was raided by rogue security agencies\u201d.\n\nThe association called on the federal government to ensure that all those responsible for this unfortunate incident are brought to book.\n\nAtiku, Secondus, Kalu Condemn Invasion\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, suspended National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),\n\nPrince Uche Secondus and Chief Whip of the Senate, Chief Orji Kalu, have condemned the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s residence.\n\nA press statement issued by his media office quoted Atiku as saying that a continuation of the notorious behaviour of security operatives conducting a raid on residences of senior judicial officers negates the ideals of a democratic society and is an affront to the independence of the judiciary.\n\nThe statement called for an apology to Justice Mary Odili.\n\nHe also demanded a probe of the circumstances that led to the raid and sanction of those involved.\n\nOn his part, Secondus described the raid as a huge embarrassment and an insult to the judiciary.\n\nHe added that said nothing can explain the embarrassing act of the security operatives on a woman who has put in much in the service of her fatherland.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, Secondus called on the relevant authorities to come clean on what informed such ignoble and dishonourable behaviour and render an unreserved apology to the judge and the judiciary.\n\nSecondus frowned at the frequent harassment of the judiciary by the current administration, pointing out that it does not say good on the country\u2019s democratic credentials and the respect for the doctrine of separation of power.\n\nSimilarly, Kalu described the invasion of the Abuja home of Justice Odili as a cruel, undemocratic, and uncivilised act.\n\nCondemning the raid on justice\u2019s home, he called on the federal government to commence a full-scale investigation into the ugly incident, adding that the unwarranted invasion of the house of the judge was capable of causing tension in the country.\n\nKalu, who is a former governor of Abia State, stressed that in a democratic setup, the rule of law must be strictly adhered to for the sake of national progress and development.\n\nWhile condemning the sad incident, he urged appropriate government agencies to discharge their duties and responsibilities in tandem with the constitution, noting that violation of human rights will set the country backward.\n\nEqually adding its voice to the condemnation, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) in a statement yesterday by its spokesman, Hon Ken Robinson, said the raid, was not only crude and primitive but barbaric and dictatorial.\n\nPANDEF submitted that the raid was another attempt by agents of the Buhari administration to further intimidate and humiliate the nation\u2019s judiciary.\n\nIt said: \u201cAnd this one of such actions too many, against persons of Southern Extraction, particularly, persons from the South-South geopolitical Zone.\n\n\u201cPANDEF DEF recalls that it was in the same nefarious manner that the Abuja residence of the former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, was invaded in January 2019, which was considered by many as part of political machinations, leading to the 2019 General Elections. Justice Walter Onnoghen was later suspended, made to face a \u201ckangaroo\u201d trial over trumped-up charges, and was forced to retire.\n\n\u201cEarlier, in 2016, the DSS or SSS, in a Gestapo manner, raided the homes of John Okoro and Sylvester Ngwuta, who is now deceased, alongside the residences of Adeniyi Ademola, and Nnamdi Dimgba of the Federal High Court in Abuja\u201d.\n\nPANDEF, therefore, called on all well-meaning and patriotic Nigerians to rise in unison and condemn these atrocious actions against citizens by the federal government and its agents.\n\nIt also called on the International Community, especially the United Kingdom and the United States, not to remain indifferent to the oppressive actions of the Nigerian government against its citizens.\n\nSANs Seek Prosecution of Invaders\n\nOn their part, some of the senior lawyers under the aegis of Concerned Senior Advocates of Nigeria of South-eastern Extraction, in a statement, described the raid as \u201canother frontal attack on the independence and integrity of the judiciary\u201d.\n\nThe concerned SANs expressed worries that the action was part of a series of events aimed at systematically intimidating and emasculating the judiciary.\n\nThe position of the concerned SANs was made known in a statement signed by Professor Ilochi Okafor (SAN); Mr. Etigwe Uwa (SAN) and Mr. Chijioke Okoli (SAN).\n\nWhile recalling similar raids by security operatives on the premises of some Justices of the Supreme Court in 2016, and residence of some Judges of the Federal High Court, in Abuja, they lamented that despite these security agencies publicly stating the raids were on mistaken identity of the premises, no one has been arrested and prosecuted for such brash criminal attack on the judiciary.\n\n\u201cWe re-emphasise that it amounts to an executive infraction on the judicial independence to continue to harass, intimidate and humiliate judges. We want to further reiterate in clear terms that given the constitutionally guaranteed doctrine of the independence of the judiciary, no security agency or prosecuting authority in Nigeria has the power to investigate, arrest, or prosecute a sitting judicial officer without first referring the matter to the National Judicial Council, and await the directive of the council.\n\n\u201cWe call on the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to immediately direct investigation of all security agents and other persons who played any role in this assault on the judiciary and any persons found culpable should be made to face the full wrath of the law\u201d, they said.\n\nOn his part, senior lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), said the invasion could be politically-motivated to embarrass her.\n\nOzekhome, who visited Odili\u2019s house after the incident, said the raid could make Nigeria a laughing stock in the international community.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t resist any search. I believe that they would have found that they were committing terrible hara-kiri, that is, giving them the benefit of the doubt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe other theory which is also as powerful is that it was politically-motivated, deliberately contrived as artifice and designed to embarrass this cerebral justice of the Supreme Court and to embarrass her husband.\n\n\u201cBut whatever theory, one thing is clear to me, we are gradually moving towards the precipice of calling ourselves a banana republic,\u201d Ozekhome said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Less than three years after assuming office as the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Ibrahim Muhammad may be removed.\n\nMeanwhile, the plot by some Presidency cabal members who are dissatisfied with Muhammad's style of leadership in the judiciary is connected to the current travails of Justice Mary Odili, wife of a former Governor of Rivers State, Peter Odili, sources told SaharaReporters.\n\nIt was also learnt that the plot to remove Muhammad and harass Justice Odili or also remove her, if necessary, is gathering steam by the day, sources told SaharaReporters.\n\nJustice Odili, a Supreme Court judge, is being haunted to ensure she does not replace Muhammad when he is removed, as the one who is next in line to the Chief Justice.\n\nMuhammad was appointed as acting CJN on January 25, 2019, following the suspension of Justice Walter Onnoghen.\n\nOnnoghen, who was appointed in 2016, was removed after corruption allegations were levelled against him.\n\nBut in March, Onnoghen, speaking at a book launch ceremony he attended with his wife, disclosed that was removed from office over a false allegation that he held a secret meeting with former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, before the 2019 general elections.\n\nMuhammad was sworn in as a substantial CJN on July 24, 2019, with expectations.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the grouse of members of the Aso Rock cabal who are also angling for the removal of Onnoghen's replacement, Muhammad, is that he has been too slow to do their bidding.\n\n\u201cThey are planning on removing the current CJN. He is expected to retire in 2023 but they are not happy with him. They said he\u2019s too slow to do their biddings,\u201d a top source told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe source said since Onnoghen was removed for him, clearly the cabal behind his good fortune had expectations of him which they think he is not delivering as anticipated.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the recent illegal raid of the Abuja residence of Justice Odili of the Supreme Court is connected with the plot to remove Muhammad. See Also Legal Security Operatives Raid Supreme Court Judge, Odili\u2019s Residence In Abuja\n\nSecurity operatives had on Friday night invaded the house of the Supreme Court Justice based on information that \u201cillegal activities\u201d were going on there.\n\nOdili is next in line to Nigeria\u2019s Chief Justice and stands to benefit from his removal should that happen before her retirement on May 12, 2022.\n\nSources said the raid, approved by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) was to let her know she would not be allowed to succeed Muhammad as the head of the nation\u2019s judiciary. See Also Legal How Attorney-General, Malami\u2019s Ministry Misled Me To Sign Warrant To Raid Supreme Court Judge, Odili\u2019s Residence \u2013 Chief Magistrate\n\nOdili, who was appointed a Justice of the Supreme Court on June 23, 2011, was born on May 12, 1952. This means she will be due for retirement by May 12, 2022, on turning 70.\n\nBut Muhammad, who was appointed a supreme court judge in 2006 and sworn in on January 8, 2007, was born on December 31, 1953 \u2014 meaning he is younger than Justice Odili and will not retire until 2023 when he turns 70.\n\nAnother source said, \u201cRegarding the raid on Odili's House, it was planned because they don\u2019t want her to become the next CJN. Though she\u2019s retiring in about six months, that is like six years to the cabal. They are planning to remove Tanko Muhammad before then and don\u2019t want the woman to even act as CJN for one day.\n\n\u201cThe most senior Justice after Odili is Olukayode Ariwoola but they claim he\u2019s got a terminal illness. He is expected to retire soon on health grounds. The fourth most senior of the Justices who could take over as CJN is Musa Dattijo Muhammad, another Northerner from Niger State. He is also expected to retire in 2023.\n\n\u201cThey accused Odili of being a PDP (opposition party - Peoples Democratic Party) judge and that her husband helps to fix lots of judgements at their home in Abuja. That was why the husband was also embarrassed recently.\n\n\u201cForget also about Malami\u2019s denials, he was directly in charge of the raid. He chose the day President Muhammadu Buhari arrived from Saudi Arabia to do it because he needed to impress Buhari that he is still loyal as efforts are being intensified to remove him as Minister.\n\n\u201cThey want to force Tanko out soon and don\u2019t want the woman to replace him. They considered her too close to the PDP, so they have to embarrass her to ensure she doesn't get to replace him at all.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the passport of the former Rivers State Governor, Odili was in June seized by the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS).\n\nHowever, on October 18, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja ordered the immediate release of former governor Odili's passport.\n\nThe court said there was no legal justification for the action the NIS took against the former governor.\n\nOdili, who was Rivers State governor from 1999 to 2007, had approached the court to challenge the seizure of his passport by the NIS.\n\nMeanwhile, the Concerned Senior Advocates of Nigeria, South-East chapter, has condemned the Friday raid on Justice Odili's residence by security operatives, describing it as another frontal attack on the independence and integrity of the Judiciary.\n\nThe SANs said the consistent and systematic attacks on the Judiciary by the Executive arm of government is clearly in breach of the constitutional protection of judges and the Judiciary.\n\nThey alleged that such attacks are aimed at emasculating the Judiciary\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued on Saturday and signed by Professor Ilochi Okafor (SAN).

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Beyond investing in African startups, Kepple Africa Ventures is creating new industries",
          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nThe eNaira project will be implemented in phases. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Frustration grows as lack of jobs rack Nigerians",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis, the worst since the country\u2019s transition to democracy in 1999, is unrelenting and waging a continuous war on the people.\n\nSome 23 million Nigerians are unemployed, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the equivalent of the population of the Netherlands and Singapore combined.\n\nThe unemployment rate of 33.3 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia. What is worse is the forecast by economists that the rate could hit 40 percent by the end of 2021. Sadly, the pain of unemployed Nigerians is however not limited to simply having no jobs.\n\nUnemployed workers do not only lose their income, but their minimum security and their health benefits. They lose the capacity to update themselves in their professions. They lose their identity. Their families are unstructured. Their lives are unstructured. A family in which all members lose their jobs lives the reality of hunger, lack of housing, illness and poor or no education.\n\nVou was sacked from her job in a bank in 2017. It was in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s first recession in 40 years. She had spent 11 years with the bank working mainly in operations, she said.\n\n\u201cWe came to the office one Monday and many of us found that we could not log into our systems. We later got our sack letters and were told to go home. They told us that if the economic situation improved, they would call us back,\u201d she narrated.\n\nRead Also: How age as job criterion worsens Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis\n\nThe economic situation has not improved much since then. Over 8,000job losses were recorded among bank workers in 2017, the trend was similar with over 3000 employee layoff in the banking sector between 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nAbout 44,664 contract staff on the payroll of commercial banks have been reduced by over 5,000 as well as over 2,000 junior staff losing their jobs, among others. According to the NBS, almost 8,000 job losses occurred in the sector in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nVow was paid her entitlements four months later. She moved to her hometown, near Jos in Plateau State and poured her entire savings into farming Fonio and Maize. It was a large farm, and Vou had plans to pour her accounting degree and financial management experience to turn it into a profitable agro-business outfit supplying Fonio, Corn and in the future, green vegetables to markets in Lagos and the South.\n\nAs the crops grew lush on fertilizer and care, the cows came. The cattle herders simply led their cows into Vou\u2019s farm and ate up her crops.\n\n\u201cIt was scorched-earth,\u201d she said, \u201cI watched them destroy my farm. They ate it all up. I called the police and they did nothing. Cows just come and eat up peoples\u2019 sweat and livelihood and nothing happens to them.\u201d\n\nWith all her savings gone, Vou lives with her mother in Jos and has spent the last four years applying for jobs. \u201cIt has been a terrible period. I have no income, no money. I depend on friends and family to survive. I have become a burden to my poor mother who I should be taking care of. The worst thing is that it looks as if I am lazy whereas I am willing to work. I just do not know where to start from\u201d.\n\nThe absence of a functioning social security system capable of providing support to households that have lost jobs and income make job losses in Nigeria especially caustic. Nigeria\u2019s constitution does not provide a legal right to social security, and as noted by Human Rights Watch, Nigerian laws create no entitlement to unemployment or child benefits. Nigeria does have a pension scheme open to employees in the formal and informal sectors, but enrolment is only about 40 percent nationally, according to the World Bank.\n\nJobless, with no incomes and battered by rising food prices, insecurity and the absence of any form of government support, more than 20 million Nigerians and their families are left hungry.\n\n\u201cA combination of rising unemployment, booming demographics, and unfulfilled aspirations is increasing the pressure on young Nigerians to migrate internationally in search for gainful employment,\u201d a recent World Bank report noted.\n\n\u201cWith limited legal migration options, young Nigerians are increasingly choosing irregular alternatives to find better work opportunities overseas.\n\nTerver lives in Abuja. He worked for a Lagos-based FMCG manufacturing company for 14 years as a Sales Representative in Kano and Kaduna states. He was sacked from his job in mid-2019.\n\n\u201cThey let us go two years ago after the company closed over 80 percent of its production capacity\u201d. The company, he said, closed shop because the economic crisis led to poor sales and hence low production.\n\nTerver has tried to find work, \u201cany work,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three children; they are all out of school now. I cannot afford to pay their school fees, so they have had to stay home and be home schooled by my wife since last year.\u201d\n\nHis wife also lost her job as a casual worker in a bank in 2018.\n\nTerver said what he fears most is a health crisis in the family. \u201cIf any serious health crisis crops up now, I\u2019m so scared that I would not be able to afford the money to deal with it. I am afraid to lose any of my children or wife to sickness. The thought keeps me awake at night.\u201d\n\nTerver\u2019s fear for his family is driving him to consider making the long tortures journey to Europe via Libya. He fully understands the risk to his life. \u201cWhat can I do,\u201d he asked, his hands wide open, his face painted in frustration. \u201cI just can\u2019t stay here and mope around, always hoping to get an elusive job while my children go hungry. Nothing kills a man more than seeing his children hungry.\u201d\n\nWhy is unemployment growing?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari claims his regime has lifted 10 million Nigerians out of poverty, the World Bank maintains that 7 million Nigerians became poor under Buhari in 2020.\n\nThe inadequacy of job opportunities in Nigeria, noted a 2015 World Bank report, \u201cis at the core of high poverty levels, regional inequality, and social and political unrest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHaving a job is often understood as receiving a wage, enjoying a minimum standard of living, and having some access to social security such as health and pension.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has been in a macabre freefall since 2015. Driven by a salad of extremely unsavoury fiscal policies by a government more keen on handing out petty cash as social welfare schemes to drive growth, taxing a shrinking economic base to access funds, and a widely ridiculed monetary policy regime from a Central Bank that has woefully failed to maintain financial stability in over six years, President Buhari\u2019s administration\u2019s incapacity to stabilise and grow the economy has left most Nigerians befuddled.\n\nQuick to blame everyone but himself, Buhari in an interview in July blamed Nigerian youths for the deteriorating rate of unemployment. The youths, he said, need to be of good behaviour so that foreign investors can come into the country.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to invest in an insecure environment\u2026 If they want jobs, they will behave themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nRevenue declines and higher costs have negatively affected businesses in Africa\u2019s largest economy, leading to unprecedented job losses, the highest ever.\n\nPolicy inconsistencies by the Nigerian government, says Ndubisi Nwokoma, professor of Economics at the University of Lagos, has led to a lot of uncertainties.\n\nSince the Buhari administration came into power in 2015, he said in a report for the \u2018Conversation\u2019, \u201cthere has been a lot of policy change with the \u201ccommand and control\u201d posture adopted in managing the economy.\n\nFor instance, exchange rates were left fixed for the first year of the administration until the distortions in the market became chaotic before some form of flexibility was allowed in the determination of the exchange rate, following market forces. Also land borders were arbitrarily closed to imports, despite the huge damage it could have on the country\u2019s trade within the ECOWAS sub-region. This had a direct impact on prices of items.\n\n\u201cThese policy somersaults have caused capital flight. The political uncertainty played a role in the downward trend of markets. In the equities market, huge foreign portfolio investments were lost to the economy. There has also been a downturn in portfolio investments, fixed capital investment, foreign direct investments and capital importation. There was also a record decline in capital importation of about $1,548.88 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of same year. And in the first quarter of 2017, capital importation was recorded to be about $908.27 million.\n\n\u201cThe result has been job losses and the dwindling capacity to create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s flamboyant claims of growth and \u2018revolution\u2019 in the agricultural sector has proved to be untenable with agriculture\u2019s share of GDP falling, and farmers-herders\u2019 clashes cutting food production across the country, leading to steep rise in food prices. Manufacturing and other sectors have also been adversely affected\n\nProfessional services firm, KPMG, in a 2020 report described the country\u2019s policy environment as volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. On the uncertain landscape of the economy, the firm stated that the uncertainty that surrounds the Nigerian economy limits decision-making capabilities. Some examples listed include the sudden border closure, ban of use of motorcycles as means of transportation in some states, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the report noted, the complex environment reflects \u201cin multiple taxation, stamp duty, increase in electricity tariffs and so on. While the ambiguous landscape is characterized by the exchange rate systems, which have made the economy unattractive for foreign direct investment.\u201d\n\nOn the low level of productivity, the report revealed that low productivity was a critical problem limiting economic potential of individuals and firms in Nigeria, asserting that Nigeria\u2019s productivity level had been trending below the country\u2019s GDP, as labour productivity continues to slope to the negative region.\n\nNigeria, it noted, \u201chas been faced with declining GDP per capita since the aftermath of recession in 2016,\u201d and asserted that \u201climited income growth, increased taxes, electricity tariff hike, inflation and high unemployment are key issues that affect consumption power.\u201d\n\nThe firm further noted that the social wheel of pressure in the country was spinning, as 31 percent of the youth-led labour force was unemployed, meaning the key engine for Nigeria\u2019s growth remains grossly underutilized.\n\nWhat must be done\n\nProviding enough productive jobs for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population presents a particular challenge, especially at a time of weak economic growth.\n\nAs posited by the World Bank, labour is the main asset for the world\u2019s poorest people. This means that the labour market is \u201cthe primary vehicle through which the proceeds of economic growth are spread to households and individuals. Therefore, understanding the labour market is crucial to achieve Nigeria\u2019s aspiration to lift 100 million people out of poverty by 2030.\u201d\n\nIt will be critical to invest in human capital, recouping learning lost due to insecurity and long years of poor investment in education by the state. Doing this will not only provide workers with the skills needed to prosper in the labour market and create jobs themselves, but as argued by the international financial institution, \u201ccould also aid the country\u2019s fertility transition, so that the proceeds of growth are shared among fewer people, enabling a faster rise in living standards.\u201d\n\nSecondly, the policy framework has to be more stable. The Nigerian government needs to address insecurity so people can thrive in their business. The government must also undertake macroeconomic reforms around exchange-rate, trade, and fiscal policies to help the economy broaden away from oil and kindle the structural transformation needed to create good wage jobs.\n\nThere are quick-win strategies too. Nigeria, said Ndubisi Nwokoma, must also encourage investment. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low level of deposit rates. And it is unattractive to invest even in treasury bills or other securities. The rates are low, and the inflation rate is much higher. So every day your money loses value. The infrastructure for small scale production, including electricity supply, is poor and people have to provide their own.\u201d\n\nWhile Buhari believes agriculture is the best route to reducing unemployment, this dated worldview is untenable. Better jobs are generally found in modern, productive enterprises.\n\nTherefore, the only way to improve youth\u2019s income-earning prospects significantly and sustainably is to improve all employment and earnings opportunities through economic transformation. Economic growth without transformation is much less effective.\n\nAs aptly noted in a 2021 Brookings Institution report, \u201ctransformation, through the creation of modern, higher-productivity firms, can gradually replace informal employment with formal employment.\u201d\n\nThe best way to increase good formal sector wage jobs is to encourage the entrance and growth of large firms, since it has been proved that large firms play an outsized role in economic transformation and employment creation since they tend to use newer technology, pay higher wages, and are more likely to export.\n\nThey push transformation forward and support resiliency because they are better able to weather economic storms. They often structure the market for medium and smaller firms operating in related sectors who will be their suppliers and retailers, thus helping to ensure their survival as well.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis, the worst since the country\u2019s transition to democracy in 1999, is unrelenting and waging a continuous war on the people.\n\nSome 23 million Nigerians are unemployed, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the equivalent of the population of the Netherlands and Singapore combined.\n\nThe unemployment rate of 33.3 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia. What is worse is the forecast by economists that the rate could hit 40 percent by the end of 2021. Sadly, the pain of unemployed Nigerians is however not limited to simply having no jobs.\n\nUnemployed workers do not only lose their income, but their minimum security and their health benefits. They lose the capacity to update themselves in their professions. They lose their identity. Their families are unstructured. Their lives are unstructured. A family in which all members lose their jobs lives the reality of hunger, lack of housing, illness and poor or no education.\n\nVou was sacked from her job in a bank in 2017. It was in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s first recession in 40 years. She had spent 11 years with the bank working mainly in operations, she said.\n\n\u201cWe came to the office one Monday and many of us found that we could not log into our systems. We later got our sack letters and were told to go home. They told us that if the economic situation improved, they would call us back,\u201d she narrated.\n\nRead Also: How age as job criterion worsens Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis\n\nThe economic situation has not improved much since then. Over 8,000job losses were recorded among bank workers in 2017, the trend was similar with over 3000 employee layoff in the banking sector between 2015 and 2016, respectively.\n\nAbout 44,664 contract staff on the payroll of commercial banks have been reduced by over 5,000 as well as over 2,000 junior staff losing their jobs, among others. According to the NBS, almost 8,000 job losses occurred in the sector in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nVow was paid her entitlements four months later. She moved to her hometown, near Jos in Plateau State and poured her entire savings into farming Fonio and Maize. It was a large farm, and Vou had plans to pour her accounting degree and financial management experience to turn it into a profitable agro-business outfit supplying Fonio, Corn and in the future, green vegetables to markets in Lagos and the South.\n\nAs the crops grew lush on fertilizer and care, the cows came. The cattle herders simply led their cows into Vou\u2019s farm and ate up her crops.\n\n\u201cIt was scorched-earth,\u201d she said, \u201cI watched them destroy my farm. They ate it all up. I called the police and they did nothing. Cows just come and eat up peoples\u2019 sweat and livelihood and nothing happens to them.\u201d\n\nWith all her savings gone, Vou lives with her mother in Jos and has spent the last four years applying for jobs. \u201cIt has been a terrible period. I have no income, no money. I depend on friends and family to survive. I have become a burden to my poor mother who I should be taking care of. The worst thing is that it looks as if I am lazy whereas I am willing to work. I just do not know where to start from\u201d.\n\nThe absence of a functioning social security system capable of providing support to households that have lost jobs and income make job losses in Nigeria especially caustic. Nigeria\u2019s constitution does not provide a legal right to social security, and as noted by Human Rights Watch, Nigerian laws create no entitlement to unemployment or child benefits. Nigeria does have a pension scheme open to employees in the formal and informal sectors, but enrolment is only about 40 percent nationally, according to the World Bank.\n\nJobless, with no incomes and battered by rising food prices, insecurity and the absence of any form of government support, more than 20 million Nigerians and their families are left hungry.\n\n\u201cA combination of rising unemployment, booming demographics, and unfulfilled aspirations is increasing the pressure on young Nigerians to migrate internationally in search for gainful employment,\u201d a recent World Bank report noted.\n\n\u201cWith limited legal migration options, young Nigerians are increasingly choosing irregular alternatives to find better work opportunities overseas.\n\nTerver lives in Abuja. He worked for a Lagos-based FMCG manufacturing company for 14 years as a Sales Representative in Kano and Kaduna states. He was sacked from his job in mid-2019.\n\n\u201cThey let us go two years ago after the company closed over 80 percent of its production capacity\u201d. The company, he said, closed shop because the economic crisis led to poor sales and hence low production.\n\nTerver has tried to find work, \u201cany work,\u201d he said. \u201cI have three children; they are all out of school now. I cannot afford to pay their school fees, so they have had to stay home and be home schooled by my wife since last year.\u201d\n\nHis wife also lost her job as a casual worker in a bank in 2018.\n\nTerver said what he fears most is a health crisis in the family. \u201cIf any serious health crisis crops up now, I\u2019m so scared that I would not be able to afford the money to deal with it. I am afraid to lose any of my children or wife to sickness. The thought keeps me awake at night.\u201d\n\nTerver\u2019s fear for his family is driving him to consider making the long tortures journey to Europe via Libya. He fully understands the risk to his life. \u201cWhat can I do,\u201d he asked, his hands wide open, his face painted in frustration. \u201cI just can\u2019t stay here and mope around, always hoping to get an elusive job while my children go hungry. Nothing kills a man more than seeing his children hungry.\u201d\n\nWhy is unemployment growing?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari claims his regime has lifted 10 million Nigerians out of poverty, the World Bank maintains that 7 million Nigerians became poor under Buhari in 2020.\n\nThe inadequacy of job opportunities in Nigeria, noted a 2015 World Bank report, \u201cis at the core of high poverty levels, regional inequality, and social and political unrest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHaving a job is often understood as receiving a wage, enjoying a minimum standard of living, and having some access to social security such as health and pension.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has been in a macabre freefall since 2015. Driven by a salad of extremely unsavoury fiscal policies by a government more keen on handing out petty cash as social welfare schemes to drive growth, taxing a shrinking economic base to access funds, and a widely ridiculed monetary policy regime from a Central Bank that has woefully failed to maintain financial stability in over six years, President Buhari\u2019s administration\u2019s incapacity to stabilise and grow the economy has left most Nigerians befuddled.\n\nQuick to blame everyone but himself, Buhari in an interview in July blamed Nigerian youths for the deteriorating rate of unemployment. The youths, he said, need to be of good behaviour so that foreign investors can come into the country.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to invest in an insecure environment\u2026 If they want jobs, they will behave themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nRevenue declines and higher costs have negatively affected businesses in Africa\u2019s largest economy, leading to unprecedented job losses, the highest ever.\n\nPolicy inconsistencies by the Nigerian government, says Ndubisi Nwokoma, professor of Economics at the University of Lagos, has led to a lot of uncertainties.\n\nSince the Buhari administration came into power in 2015, he said in a report for the \u2018Conversation\u2019, \u201cthere has been a lot of policy change with the \u201ccommand and control\u201d posture adopted in managing the economy.\n\nFor instance, exchange rates were left fixed for the first year of the administration until the distortions in the market became chaotic before some form of flexibility was allowed in the determination of the exchange rate, following market forces. Also land borders were arbitrarily closed to imports, despite the huge damage it could have on the country\u2019s trade within the ECOWAS sub-region. This had a direct impact on prices of items.\n\n\u201cThese policy somersaults have caused capital flight. The political uncertainty played a role in the downward trend of markets. In the equities market, huge foreign portfolio investments were lost to the economy. There has also been a downturn in portfolio investments, fixed capital investment, foreign direct investments and capital importation. There was also a record decline in capital importation of about $1,548.88 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of same year. And in the first quarter of 2017, capital importation was recorded to be about $908.27 million.\n\n\u201cThe result has been job losses and the dwindling capacity to create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s flamboyant claims of growth and \u2018revolution\u2019 in the agricultural sector has proved to be untenable with agriculture\u2019s share of GDP falling, and farmers-herders\u2019 clashes cutting food production across the country, leading to steep rise in food prices. Manufacturing and other sectors have also been adversely affected\n\nProfessional services firm, KPMG, in a 2020 report described the country\u2019s policy environment as volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. On the uncertain landscape of the economy, the firm stated that the uncertainty that surrounds the Nigerian economy limits decision-making capabilities. Some examples listed include the sudden border closure, ban of use of motorcycles as means of transportation in some states, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, the report noted, the complex environment reflects \u201cin multiple taxation, stamp duty, increase in electricity tariffs and so on. While the ambiguous landscape is characterized by the exchange rate systems, which have made the economy unattractive for foreign direct investment.\u201d\n\nOn the low level of productivity, the report revealed that low productivity was a critical problem limiting economic potential of individuals and firms in Nigeria, asserting that Nigeria\u2019s productivity level had been trending below the country\u2019s GDP, as labour productivity continues to slope to the negative region.\n\nNigeria, it noted, \u201chas been faced with declining GDP per capita since the aftermath of recession in 2016,\u201d and asserted that \u201climited income growth, increased taxes, electricity tariff hike, inflation and high unemployment are key issues that affect consumption power.\u201d\n\nThe firm further noted that the social wheel of pressure in the country was spinning, as 31 percent of the youth-led labour force was unemployed, meaning the key engine for Nigeria\u2019s growth remains grossly underutilized.\n\nWhat must be done\n\nProviding enough productive jobs for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population presents a particular challenge, especially at a time of weak economic growth.\n\nAs posited by the World Bank, labour is the main asset for the world\u2019s poorest people. This means that the labour market is \u201cthe primary vehicle through which the proceeds of economic growth are spread to households and individuals. Therefore, understanding the labour market is crucial to achieve Nigeria\u2019s aspiration to lift 100 million people out of poverty by 2030.\u201d\n\nIt will be critical to invest in human capital, recouping learning lost due to insecurity and long years of poor investment in education by the state. Doing this will not only provide workers with the skills needed to prosper in the labour market and create jobs themselves, but as argued by the international financial institution, \u201ccould also aid the country\u2019s fertility transition, so that the proceeds of growth are shared among fewer people, enabling a faster rise in living standards.\u201d\n\nSecondly, the policy framework has to be more stable. The Nigerian government needs to address insecurity so people can thrive in their business. The government must also undertake macroeconomic reforms around exchange-rate, trade, and fiscal policies to help the economy broaden away from oil and kindle the structural transformation needed to create good wage jobs.\n\nThere are quick-win strategies too. Nigeria, said Ndubisi Nwokoma, must also encourage investment. \u201cThere\u2019s a very low level of deposit rates. And it is unattractive to invest even in treasury bills or other securities. The rates are low, and the inflation rate is much higher. So every day your money loses value. The infrastructure for small scale production, including electricity supply, is poor and people have to provide their own.\u201d\n\nWhile Buhari believes agriculture is the best route to reducing unemployment, this dated worldview is untenable. Better jobs are generally found in modern, productive enterprises.\n\nTherefore, the only way to improve youth\u2019s income-earning prospects significantly and sustainably is to improve all employment and earnings opportunities through economic transformation. Economic growth without transformation is much less effective.\n\nAs aptly noted in a 2021 Brookings Institution report, \u201ctransformation, through the creation of modern, higher-productivity firms, can gradually replace informal employment with formal employment.\u201d\n\nThe best way to increase good formal sector wage jobs is to encourage the entrance and growth of large firms, since it has been proved that large firms play an outsized role in economic transformation and employment creation since they tend to use newer technology, pay higher wages, and are more likely to export.\n\nThey push transformation forward and support resiliency because they are better able to weather economic storms. They often structure the market for medium and smaller firms operating in related sectors who will be their suppliers and retailers, thus helping to ensure their survival as well.",

PREMIUM TIMES had reported that men of the State Security Services (SSS) were involved in the raid.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) had also condemned the raid on the jurist\u2019s house and called for probe.\n\nMr Onofiok said the raid further exposed the judiciary to public opprobrium due to the manner the search warrant was procured.\n\nThe lawmaker expressed concerns that the \u201cwarrant was revoked by the issuing Magistrate who had discovered that it was procured by the Applicant on the premises of misrepresented facts.\u201d\n\nHe added that the \u201cdevelopment is also a wake-up call to tighten administrative and supervisory control over the operations of law enforcement agencies in the Country.\u201d\n\nWhile calling for investigation, Mr Onofiok said \u201cthe confidence and respect of citizens in the judiciary may likely wane if incidence of this nature continues unchecked.\n\n\u201cOn this note, the House of Representative Committee on the Judiciary calls for a discreet investigation to unravel the persons behind this ignoble act, which is capable of straining the existing relationship between the Judiciary and the Executive arms of our democratic government,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Odili is currently the second most senior Justice of the Supreme Court and she is due to retire in 2022.",

Profit Before Tax (PBT) also rose to NGN180 billion, reflecting a 1% growth over the NGN177 billion recorded in the same period in the previous year.\n\nDespite continuing economic uncertainties, the Group was able to grow its net earnings through a reduction in its cost of funds while keeping the cost of risk flat. This strengthened Earnings Per Share (EPS) by 1% to NGN5.11. The Group achieved a 9% growth in interest income from loans and advances on the back of an increase in gross loans of 9% year to date and enhanced efficiency, culminating in a 21% drop in interest expense to NGN74 billion from NGN94 billion.

The Group continues to make significant progress in its retail banking drive, as evidenced by remarkable growth in transaction volumes and value across its digital platforms and strong growth in customer acquisition.\n\nFor the final quarter of the year, management\u2019s outlook remains positive, buoyed by a declining inflationary trend, expected increase in foreign exchange inflows, and improving oil production. The Group remains focused on increasing its retail market share, consolidating its leadership position in the corporate segment and maintaining a robust balance sheet.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom.

They were the choice of Deputy National Chairman South and that of the North.\n\nFor instance Oyinlola who came to the convention ground after being assured at home, was at the last minute betrayed by Governor Seyi Makinde, who backed the former Deputy Governor of Oyo State and the current Chairman, South West of the party, to emerge as the Deputy chairman for South.\n\nIt was the same game plan with the counterpart in the North, as Ambassador Uma Illiya Damagum, who was a governor\u2019s candidate emerged as the the Deputy Chairman North, against Mayryam Ciroma, who like Oyinlola refused to stepped down when ask to do so at the convention ground.\n\nThe machineries put up by the elders and Presidential hopefuls, like the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, Former Senate President Bukola Saraki and others, to make Oyinlola and Ciroma emerge, failed as the governors definitely had their way.\n\nAtiku, Saraki, Lamido and others had wanted Ciroma and Oyinlola in order to curtail the overbearing influence of the governors but failed.\n\nThe convention was also an avenue for the presidential aspirants to declare their intentions, as they all displayed posters and banners to let the members know that they are coming out for the primary of the party.\n\nFrom what was witnessed, Atiku, Saraki, Rabiu Kwankwaso, Lamido and former FCT Minister and Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, have declared interest to contest for president.\n\nJust as it happened in Lagos in 2014 at the APC Presidential Primary at theTeslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere, where Kwankwaso came second, it was said that his supporters with their red caps and head gears dominated the Eagle square where they danced round with their principal, Kwankwaso.\n\nAt the end of the day the following individuals, all candidates backed by governors, emerged.\n\nMany of the positions, including the chairmanship, won by Dr Iyorchia Ayu, were filled by consensus.\n\nNational Chairman \u2013 Iyorchia Ayu\n\nDeputy National Chairman (North) \u2013 Umar Damagum (Contested)\n\nDeputy National Chairman (South) \u2013 Taofeek Arapaja (Contested)\n\nNational Secretary \u2013 Samuel Anyanwu (Unopposed)\n\nNational Treasurer \u2013 Ahmed Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nNational Organising Secretary \u2013 Umar Bature (Unopposed)\n\nNational Financial Secretary \u2013 Daniel Woyegikuro (Unopposed)\n\nNational Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Professor Stella Effah-Attoe (Unopposed)\n\nNational Youth Leader \u2013 Muhammed Suleiman (Contested)\n\nNational Legal Adviser \u2013 Kamaldeen Ajibade (Unopposed)\n\nNational Publicity Secretary \u2013 Debo Ologunagba (Unopposed)\n\nNational Auditor \u2013 Okechuckwu Daniel (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Secretary \u2013 Setoji Kosheodo (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Treasurer \u2013 Ndubisi David (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Publicity Secretary \u2013 Ibrahim Abdullahi (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Organising Secretary \u2013 Ighoyota Amori (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Financial Secretary \u2013 Adamu Kamale (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Hajara Wanka (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Youth Leader \u2013 Timothy Osadolor (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Legal Adviser \u2013 Okechukwu Osuoha (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Auditor \u2013 Abdulrahman Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nMeanwhile the Chairmanship elect Dr Ayu promised to unite the party and put together a winning team ahead of the next presidential elections.\n\nHe castigated the ruling APC, accusing the president Muhammadu Buhari government of destroying Nigeria\u2019s economy, while arguing that the hope of Nigerians now lies with the PDP.\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, the National convention committee Chairman, Ahmed Fintiri and the outgoing acting Chairman of the party, Elder Yemi Akinwumi, chided the APC for the role it is playing to disintegrate Nigeria, with its policies which they claimed were inimical to the progress and aspirations of the people.\n\nFintiri and Akinwumi said members should come together, while Fintiri declared that the inauguration of the newly elected executives would come on December 9, 2021 to ensure smooth transition and for the current executives to finish their tenure.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "A mass exodus of residents has hit Anambra State following the increasing level of violence ahead of the governorship election coming up in the state on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, the popular Eke-Awka market in Awka, the state capital, was thrown into serious pandemonium yesterday following a clash between rival cult groups during which two of their members were killed and many others sustained bullet wounds and machete cuts.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that traders and their customers fled as gunfire rented the air in the market. Two youths were shot dead at the Gbalingba area of the market, with some of the cult members pursuing one another with guns, axes and machetes.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that parts of the state mostly hit by the mass exit of people are the major town, including Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi, Ekwulobia and Ihiala.\n\nIt was learnt that most of the hotels in parts of Enugu State, especially, Enugu, the state capital, and Nsukka, the university town, are fully taken up by people running away from Anambra State ahead of the governorship election.\n\nSome people are also relocating to nearby Asaba in Delta State to take up temporary refuge.\n\nLEADERSHIP learnt that many non-natives of Anambra are relocating to their village to return after the election.\n\n\u201cMany people leaving with us here in Awada, they have travelled. Since yesterday (Saturday) people have been travelling because many people have been killed. On Friday they killed P and T; he is the owner of P and T Block Industry. We are also planning to travel to the village, to stay there until after the election\u201d, a resident of Awada, an Onitsha suburb town of Obosi, Idemili South local government told LEADERSHIP.\n\nAs a result of insecurity, between 7:30pm and 8pm most of the streets in major cities, especially in Awka, would be empty of activities as most residents retire to their homes to stay out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nGates have been mounted on entry and exit points of virtually all the streets in Awka, and they are usually locked from 10pm.\n\nWhen contacted, spokesman of the Anambra State Police Command, DSP Ikenga Toochukwu, urged those leaving the state out of fear to come back as he assured them that the command was prepared to provide adequate security before, during, and after the governorship election.\n\n\u201cThose who are leaving the state are actually acting based on speculation. I can assure you that we are on top of the situation. People should stop panicking; they should rather give information to the police concerning criminal elements, and acts of criminality.\n\n\u201cAs for the killings you said that happened at Eke Awka market, I am yet to get the details\u201d, the state police imagemaker told LEADERSHIP on phone.\n\nFrom Abuja, Nigeria Police Force assured the people of Anambra State that the police were prepared to safeguard the citizens of the state before, during and after the elections.\n\nSpeaking to LEADERSHIP on phone last night, Force spokesman, CP Frank Mba, told Anambra people to be assured that the police will protect them as they had done.\n\nHe also said the police had foiled several attacks by unknown gunmen and there was no need for the voters to fear.\n\nAnd worried by the escalating security crisis in the South East, traditional and religious leaders from the zone have urged the federal government and other stakeholders to explore dialogue and negotiation to speed up de-escalation of insecurity and dislocation of the region.\n\nThe leaders also urged government to take immediate steps to de-proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and release its leader, Nnamdi Kanu and all IPOB members being held in various detention facilities in Nigeria.\n\nIn a joint statement by the leaders in the region, they assured Igbo youths that they are concerned about their cries of marginalisation, injustice and longsuffering, just as they urged them to de-escalate the tension and remain law-abiding to enable them engage the federal government in finding a lasting solution to the crisis.\n\nThey further urged IPOB not to do anything that would hinder the smooth conduct of the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State just as they asked them to cancel all scheduled sit-at-home orders, saying they had caused untold hardship to the people.\n\nThe statement was jointly signed by chairman, South East Council of Traditional Rulers, H.M. Igwe Charles Mkpuma who also doubles as chairman, Ebonyi State Traditional Rulers Council; and his counterparts in Abia, H.M. Eze Joseph N. Nwabeke; Anambra, H.M. Obi Nnaemeka Achebe; Enugu, H.M. Igwe L.O.C. Agubuzu; and Imo, H.M. Eze Dr E.C. Okeke;\n\nOthers are Most Rev. Dr. Anthony J. V. Obinna, Catholic Archbishop of Owerri; Most Rev. Dr Emmanuel O. Chukwuma, Anglican Archbishop of Enugu; Most Rev. Dr. Chibuzo R. Opoko, Methodist Archbishop of Umuahia; Most Rev. Dr. Valerian M. Okeke, Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha.\n\nOthers are Most Rev. Dr Uma A. Onwunta, Past Principal Clerk, Presbyterian Church Nigeria; Bishop Obi Onubogu, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria; and Rev. Dr. Abraham Nwali, chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South East Zone.\n\nThe leaders, who noted that the security crisis has deepened the hardships being faced by the citizens and rendered prostrate the socio-political and economic lives of the people, requested audience with President Muhammadu Buhari to discuss possible political solutions to secure the release of IPOB leader Kanu and other security issues in the region.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe, the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the Representatives of Igbo Archbishops and Bishops, note with deep concern the high level of insecurity and socio-economic disruption in the South East Zone of Nigeria. This has deepened the hardships being faced by the citizens and rendered prostrate the socio-political and economic lives of our people.\n\n\u201cFlowing from similar initiatives taken to bring peace to other troubled parts of the country, we urge the federal government and other stakeholders to explore dialogue and negotiation in resolving critical issues that threaten national unity, cohesion and development.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we refer to our earlier request for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the Representatives of Igbo Archbishops and Bishops, and restate this call even more strongly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are of the firm belief that this act of courage and statesmanship is not only imperative but will speedily de-escalate the heightened state of insecurity and dislocation in the South East Zone.\n\n\u201cWe also urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the federal government to take immediate steps to de-proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and release all IPOB members being held in various detention facilities in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe call on the federal government to take urgent steps to demilitarize the South East Zone, more so as it has become apparent that a continued military siege on the region can only lead to heightened tension, skirmishes and endless bloodletting between the security agencies and our youths. It has become urgent, imperative and compelling to de-emphasize the military option and move towards finding a political solution that will lead to sustainable peace.\u201d\n\nThe South East traditional and religious leaders noted that heightened inequality and marginalization remain at the core of youth restiveness in the region.\n\nThey went on: \u201cWe urge our apex national leadership to note that until it takes deliberate steps to run government on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and non-discrimination, this restiveness is likely to continue.\u201d\n\nThey assured the region\u2019s youths that their cries of marginalization, injustice and longsuffering had been heard, but that they should de-escalate the tension and remain law-abiding to enable the leaders engage especially the federal government towards finding a lasting solution to the crisis.\n\nThis is just as they called on the candidates in the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election to eschew violence and commit to free, fair and credible election.\n\nYiaga Africa Urges INEC To Distribute PVCs To New Voters\n\nMeanwhile, an independent election observer group, Yiaga Africa, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to commence the distribution of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to new registrants ahead of the governorship election in Anambra.\n\nDirector of programmes, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, made the call in the fourth Watching the Vote (WTV) pre-election report in Awka yesterday.\n\nMbamalu said: \u201cYiaga commends INEC for its efforts to distribute the PVCs from previous registrations.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are worried that, with less than few days to the election, the commission has yet to commence distribution of the PVCs to the 76,104 newly eligible voters.\n\n\u201cThese are voters who recently got registered during the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) in the state. This, if not addressed, could potentially disenfranchise eligible voters.\u201d\n\nMbamalu noted that insecurity had continued to remain a major threat to the election.\n\nAccording to her, the current situation of insecurity in the state had hindered political party campaigns, voter education and mobilisation as stakeholders continue to deploy more caution.\n\nShe urged election stakeholders to continue to show determination to ensure credible and peaceful conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies should partner civil society organisations to promote activities and initiatives that would increase citizens\u2019 confidence and encourage participation in the election.\n\n\u201cPolitical party candidates and supporters should ensure they promote a peaceful election and encourage citizens to collect their PVCs to vote.\n\n\u201cAnd the citizens should understand that voting in elections is the legitimate means of making citizens\u2019 voices heard as well as voting in desirable leaders,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "A mass exodus of residents has hit Anambra State following the increasing level of violence ahead of the governorship election coming up in the state on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, the popular Eke-Awka market in Awka, the state capital, was thrown into serious pandemonium yesterday following a clash between rival cult groups during which two of their members were killed and many others sustained bullet wounds and machete cuts.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that traders and their customers fled as gunfire rented the air in the market. Two youths were shot dead at the Gbalingba area of the market, with some of the cult members pursuing one another with guns, axes and machetes.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that parts of the state mostly hit by the mass exit of people are the major town, including Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi, Ekwulobia and Ihiala.\n\nIt was learnt that most of the hotels in parts of Enugu State, especially, Enugu, the state capital, and Nsukka, the university town, are fully taken up by people running away from Anambra State ahead of the governorship election.\n\nSome people are also relocating to nearby Asaba in Delta State to take up temporary refuge.\n\nLEADERSHIP learnt that many non-natives of Anambra are relocating to their village to return after the election.\n\n\u201cMany people leaving with us here in Awada, they have travelled. Since yesterday (Saturday) people have been travelling because many people have been killed. On Friday they killed P and T; he is the owner of P and T Block Industry. We are also planning to travel to the village, to stay there until after the election\u201d, a resident of Awada, an Onitsha suburb town of Obosi, Idemili South local government told LEADERSHIP.\n\nAs a result of insecurity, between 7:30pm and 8pm most of the streets in major cities, especially in Awka, would be empty of activities as most residents retire to their homes to stay out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nGates have been mounted on entry and exit points of virtually all the streets in Awka, and they are usually locked from 10pm.\n\nWhen contacted, spokesman of the Anambra State Police Command, DSP Ikenga Toochukwu, urged those leaving the state out of fear to come back as he assured them that the command was prepared to provide adequate security before, during, and after the governorship election.\n\n\u201cThose who are leaving the state are actually acting based on speculation. I can assure you that we are on top of the situation. People should stop panicking; they should rather give information to the police concerning criminal elements, and acts of criminality.\n\n\u201cAs for the killings you said that happened at Eke Awka market, I am yet to get the details\u201d, the state police imagemaker told LEADERSHIP on phone.\n\nFrom Abuja, Nigeria Police Force assured the people of Anambra State that the police were prepared to safeguard the citizens of the state before, during and after the elections.\n\nSpeaking to LEADERSHIP on phone last night, Force spokesman, CP Frank Mba, told Anambra people to be assured that the police will protect them as they had done.\n\nHe also said the police had foiled several attacks by unknown gunmen and there was no need for the voters to fear.\n\nAnd worried by the escalating security crisis in the South East, traditional and religious leaders from the zone have urged the federal government and other stakeholders to explore dialogue and negotiation to speed up de-escalation of insecurity and dislocation of the region.\n\nThe leaders also urged government to take immediate steps to de-proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and release its leader, Nnamdi Kanu and all IPOB members being held in various detention facilities in Nigeria.\n\nIn a joint statement by the leaders in the region, they assured Igbo youths that they are concerned about their cries of marginalisation, injustice and longsuffering, just as they urged them to de-escalate the tension and remain law-abiding to enable them engage the federal government in finding a lasting solution to the crisis.\n\nThey further urged IPOB not to do anything that would hinder the smooth conduct of the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State just as they asked them to cancel all scheduled sit-at-home orders, saying they had caused untold hardship to the people.\n\nThe statement was jointly signed by chairman, South East Council of Traditional Rulers, H.M. Igwe Charles Mkpuma who also doubles as chairman, Ebonyi State Traditional Rulers Council; and his counterparts in Abia, H.M. Eze Joseph N. Nwabeke; Anambra, H.M. Obi Nnaemeka Achebe; Enugu, H.M. Igwe L.O.C. Agubuzu; and Imo, H.M. Eze Dr E.C. Okeke;\n\nOthers are Most Rev. Dr. Anthony J. V. Obinna, Catholic Archbishop of Owerri; Most Rev. Dr Emmanuel O. Chukwuma, Anglican Archbishop of Enugu; Most Rev. Dr. Chibuzo R. Opoko, Methodist Archbishop of Umuahia; Most Rev. Dr. Valerian M. Okeke, Catholic Archbishop of Onitsha.\n\nOthers are Most Rev. Dr Uma A. Onwunta, Past Principal Clerk, Presbyterian Church Nigeria; Bishop Obi Onubogu, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria; and Rev. Dr. Abraham Nwali, chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South East Zone.\n\nThe leaders, who noted that the security crisis has deepened the hardships being faced by the citizens and rendered prostrate the socio-political and economic lives of the people, requested audience with President Muhammadu Buhari to discuss possible political solutions to secure the release of IPOB leader Kanu and other security issues in the region.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe, the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the Representatives of Igbo Archbishops and Bishops, note with deep concern the high level of insecurity and socio-economic disruption in the South East Zone of Nigeria. This has deepened the hardships being faced by the citizens and rendered prostrate the socio-political and economic lives of our people.\n\n\u201cFlowing from similar initiatives taken to bring peace to other troubled parts of the country, we urge the federal government and other stakeholders to explore dialogue and negotiation in resolving critical issues that threaten national unity, cohesion and development.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we refer to our earlier request for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to the South East Council of Traditional Rulers and the Representatives of Igbo Archbishops and Bishops, and restate this call even more strongly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are of the firm belief that this act of courage and statesmanship is not only imperative but will speedily de-escalate the heightened state of insecurity and dislocation in the South East Zone.\n\n\u201cWe also urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the federal government to take immediate steps to de-proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and release all IPOB members being held in various detention facilities in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe call on the federal government to take urgent steps to demilitarize the South East Zone, more so as it has become apparent that a continued military siege on the region can only lead to heightened tension, skirmishes and endless bloodletting between the security agencies and our youths. It has become urgent, imperative and compelling to de-emphasize the military option and move towards finding a political solution that will lead to sustainable peace.\u201d\n\nThe South East traditional and religious leaders noted that heightened inequality and marginalization remain at the core of youth restiveness in the region.\n\nThey went on: \u201cWe urge our apex national leadership to note that until it takes deliberate steps to run government on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and non-discrimination, this restiveness is likely to continue.\u201d\n\nThey assured the region\u2019s youths that their cries of marginalization, injustice and longsuffering had been heard, but that they should de-escalate the tension and remain law-abiding to enable the leaders engage especially the federal government towards finding a lasting solution to the crisis.\n\nThis is just as they called on the candidates in the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election to eschew violence and commit to free, fair and credible election.\n\nYiaga Africa Urges INEC To Distribute PVCs To New Voters\n\nMeanwhile, an independent election observer group, Yiaga Africa, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to commence the distribution of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to new registrants ahead of the governorship election in Anambra.\n\nDirector of programmes, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, made the call in the fourth Watching the Vote (WTV) pre-election report in Awka yesterday.\n\nMbamalu said: \u201cYiaga commends INEC for its efforts to distribute the PVCs from previous registrations.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are worried that, with less than few days to the election, the commission has yet to commence distribution of the PVCs to the 76,104 newly eligible voters.\n\n\u201cThese are voters who recently got registered during the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) in the state. This, if not addressed, could potentially disenfranchise eligible voters.\u201d\n\nMbamalu noted that insecurity had continued to remain a major threat to the election.\n\nAccording to her, the current situation of insecurity in the state had hindered political party campaigns, voter education and mobilisation as stakeholders continue to deploy more caution.\n\nShe urged election stakeholders to continue to show determination to ensure credible and peaceful conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies should partner civil society organisations to promote activities and initiatives that would increase citizens\u2019 confidence and encourage participation in the election.\n\n\u201cPolitical party candidates and supporters should ensure they promote a peaceful election and encourage citizens to collect their PVCs to vote.\n\n\u201cAnd the citizens should understand that voting in elections is the legitimate means of making citizens\u2019 voices heard as well as voting in desirable leaders,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor has called on the military authorities to obey the court judgement in favour of 38 senior officers of the Nigerian Army and grant them voluntary retirement.\n\nIrabor made the request in a letter he wrote to the Defence Minister, General Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd) to revisit the issues surrounding the \u201carbitrary\u201d retirement of the 38 officers.\n\nHis action followed the failure of the Nigerian Army to recall the \u201cwrongfully\u201d retired officers after a series of intervention by the minister of justice and the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami based an industrial court verdict.\n\nAmong those sacked \u201carbitrarily\u201d by the Nigerian Army authorities in 2016 were nine major generals, 10 brigadier generals, colonels and a major.\n\nThe authorities of the Nigerian Army had ignored the plight of the \u201cvictimised\u201d officers, the verdict of the court and the intervention of the National Assembly (NASS) to have them reinstated as ordered by different courts.\n\nIn the letter to the defence minister with reference No. CDS/8/A, General Irabor cited the disobedience to court order on the reinstatement, the intervention of the justice minister and other appeals to President Muhammadu Buhari on the plight of the officers.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cMeanwhile, to resolve and ensure compliance of the judgement, the Honourable Minister of Justice also intervened by imploring the Nigerian Army through the CDS to comply with the subsisting court judgement.\n\n\u201cIt would be noted however that the issue remains unresolved hence this current appeal to revisit the 2016 compulsory retirement of the 38 senior army officers.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the appeal is being made on the need to motivate both serving and retired personnel, sustain morale and sharpen the psyche of the future generation of officers.\n\n\u201cThe appeal, therefore, if upheld will ensure the primacy of military organisational values are kept permanently high without dampening morale or breeding mistrust.\n\n\u201cIt is apt to state that reservists and retired military personnel are a vital workforce for advancing national interests, as such, must be carefully managed to check inordinate activities by highly skilled but disgruntled personnel.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is in view of the foregoing, and to lay the matter to rest, this appeal is recommending that the 38 NA senior officers be voluntarily retired with effect from January 1, 2018.\u201d\n\nThe affected officers are Maj Gen MY Ibrahim, Maj Gen SD Aliyu, Maj Gen FO Alli, Maj Gen IN Ijioma, Maj Gen Ejemai, Maj Gen LC Ilo, Maj Gen Ude, Maj Gen EJ Atewe and Maj Gen LI Wiwa.\n\nThe Brigadier Generals are Brig Gen LM Bello, Brig Gen ASH Saad, Brig Gen Mormoni-Bashir, Brig Gen DM Onoyvieta, Brig Gen B Fibuonuma, Brig Gen Koko-Essien, Brig Gen IM Lawson, Brig Gen AI Onibasa, Brig Gen D Abdulsalam and Brig Gen Aghachi.\n\nThe Colonels are Col DR Hassan, Col MA Suleiman, Col FD Kayode, Col TT Minimah, Col FE Ekpenyong, Col OU Nwankwo and Col CK Ukoha.\n\nThe Lieutenant Colonels are Lt Col TO Oladuntoye, Lt Col CO Amadi, Lt Col OA Baba-Ochankpa, Lt Col E Egemole, Lt Col KO Adimoha, Lt Col DB Dazang, Lt Col T Arigbe, Lt Col Enemchukwu, Lt Col GC Nyekwu, Lt Col A Mohammed, Lt Col AS Mohammed and Major TA Williams.",

          "text": "The Joint troops of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) have bombed Boko Haram\u2019s enclave in Sambisa Forest, killing 37 terrorists and destroying gun trucks.\n\nArmy spokesman, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement late Sunday night said the troops had continued to intensify their onslaught on terrorists\u2019 enclaves in the North East, as in the early hours of Saturday 30 October 2021, the vigilant troops observed the movement of six Gun Trucks within Sambisa Forest general area, which were subsequently located at a settlement near Yuwe.\n\n\u201cThe trucks later moved to a remote location, where they were joined by other terrorist elements, in what seemed like a convergence for a meeting. Over 50 Boko Haram/ ISWAP fighters were observed to have gathered at the meeting.\n\n\u201cHaving clearly identified the terrorists\u2019 hideout, the Air Component of OPHK immediately dispatched two aircrafts to conduct air interdiction on the location.\n\n\u201cThe strikes, which were carried out under cover of darkness, were successful and devastating, as battle damage assessment corroborated by local sources revealed that over 37 Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists were neutralized, while several of them reportedly suffered varying degrees of injury,\u201d he said.\n\nNwachukwu added that in another development, as the aircrafts retreated to base after the air interdiction, the combat air crew located another set of four Gun Trucks about six kilometres South West of Bama. He said the air crew immediately relayed the coordinates of the location of the Gun Trucks to troops of the Land Component at Bama, who promptly engaged the location with artillery fire bombardment, neutralizing the insurgents\u2019 gun trucks.\n\n\u201cThe successful joint operations conducted by both the Air and Land Components, with the support of other security agencies under Operation HADIN KAI has yet again underscored the importance of synergy and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and insurgency.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has sued President Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for failing to investigate charges that over $880 billion in public monies had gone missing from 367 ministries, divisions, and organizations.\n\nSERAP is seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to promptly investigate the alleged missing N881 billion in public funds and to ensure the prosecution of those suspected to be responsible, as well as the full recovery of any missing, mismanaged, or diverted public funds\u201d in a suit filed last week in the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe complaint follows claims made in part 2 of the 2018 annual audited report by the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation that $880,894,733,084.811 was spent by 367 MDAs without any appropriation, according to a statement issued by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application, as it would improve respect for the rights of Nigerians, and improve their access to essential public goods and services, which ought to be provided by the indicted MDAs.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has a constitutional duty to ensure the investigation and prosecution of allegations of corruption, as well as recovery of any missing public funds. Section 15[5] of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution [as amended], requires the Buhari administration to abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power.\u201d\n\nSERAP added that the missing funds have hindered the ability of the MDAs to meet the needs of the citizens.\n\nIt noted, \u201cThe alleged missing public funds have hampered the ability of the indicted MDAs to meet the needs of average citizens, as the missing funds could have helped the government to invest in key public goods and services, and to improve access of Nigerians to these goods and services.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN, and the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, are also named as Respondents in the complaint.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyer Oluwadare read in part: \u201cThe failure to investigate the allegations of grand corruption contained in part 2 of the 2018 annual audited report constitutes a grave violation of the duty placed on the Nigerian government to take appropriate measures to promote transparency and accountability in the management of public finances.\u201d\n\n\u201cMandamus is a high prerogative writ which lies to secure the performance of public duty. It gives a command that a duty of a public nature which normally, though not necessarily is imposed by statute but is neglected or refused to be done after due demand, be done.\n\n\u201cIf there is a discretion to perform the duty, the court has the power to examine whether the discretion to refuse to act has been properly exercised.\u201d\n\nIt noted that the recovery of the missing funds would reduce pressure on the government to borrow money to fund the budget.\n\n\u201cRecovering the alleged missing public funds would reduce the pressure on the Federal Government to borrow more money to fund the budget, enable the authorities to meet the country\u2019s constitutional and international obligations, and reduce the growing level of public debts.\n\n\u201cThese damning revelations suggest a grave violation of the public trust, the Nigerian Constitution of 1999, and international human rights and anti-corruption standards. Spending public funds without appropriation will create opportunities for corruption.\n\n\u201cTransparent and accountable public financial management is a key pillar of good governance, and of vital importance to provide public goods and services to citizens, as well as to create and maintain fair and sustainable economic and social conditions in the country,\u201d the statement read.\n\nHowever, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "National Chairman-Elect of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Iyorchia Ayu has thrown a challenge to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSpecifically, the former President of the Senate said the successes recorded in the major opposition\u2019s just-concluded National Convention tagged \u201cNigeria Rescue Mission\u201d is a challenge to the ruling party to prepare and quit Aso Rock come 2023.\n\nAyu stated this in the early hours of Sunday after he was declared winner at the party\u2019s Special National Convention held at the Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nGoing down memory lane, the former minister said: \u201cWhen we started this party 23 years ago, we never in any way imagine that the journey will get us to this stage. A stage where we ruled for 16 years, we went into rough times, but for anybody who bothers to see, PDP is back. PDP is back to rescue Nigeria from the terrible mess we have been in, in the last six years.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany people imagined that this convention will lead to the breakup for the PDP. Those people who are dreaming like that were dreaming in a wonderland. Their dream was misplaced. Those who have lost hope should know that Nigeria is not a divided country. A small group of people decided to divide Nigeria. PDP will come back to unite our people; put them together, north and south, east and west.\n\n\u201cWe will move ahead to develop this country. We did it before. We are going to do it again. I want to thank the governors. I want to thank the delegates. I want to thank our supporters and every single person who has made this event such a huge success.\n\n\u201cI believe the other party can never hold a convention because even state congresses, they cannot hold. They have produced 92 state chairmen for 36 states, how can they hold a successful convention which the PDP has done? We are waiting for them. This is a challenge to them. Let them come and hold a successful convention. This is a quit notice, PDP is back and is taking back the country to develop it.\u201d\n\nParty chieftain Balogun too\n\nIn a similar comment, a PDP chieftain and lawmaker representing Oyo South Senatorial District, Senator Kola Balogun has said the convention was a demonstration of the party\u2019s commitment to participatory democracy.\n\nSenator Balogun stated this in a congratulatory message to the former deputy governor of Oyo state, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja on his emergence as the PDP deputy national chairman (South.)\n\nIn the statement signed by his media aide, Mr Dapo Falade, the lawmaker said Arapaja\u2019s emergence was victory for democracy, adding that the former deputy governor would further the cause and course of unity in the party.\n\nHe said: \u201cIndeed, the PDP, through the National Convention, has, once again, demonstrated its firm believe in participatory democracy. It is showing and leading the other political parties the way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victory of Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja and his emergence as the PDP Deputy National Chairman (South) at the National Convention of our great party, is a victory for the entire PDP family.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Arapaja emerged the winner of an exercise that was transparently clear and that was free and fair. The PDP has shown the way to go in the conduct of elections in our country. The victory of our new Deputy National Chairman (South) is not a personal victory but also a victory for the PDP, its teeming members and followers and, indeed, the entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker lauded the former governor of Osun state, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, for demonstrating the essence of participatory democracy.\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, on his belief in participatory democracy. His contesting for the same post lends more credibility to the PDP National Convention.\n\n\u201cPrince Oyinlola is a respected elder of our great party. His loss at the convention is nothing personal. I believe that he will continue to remain relevant in the PDP and he will always be there as one of our elders in the party,\u201d Balogun said.\n\nAPC\n\nBut the newly elected Enugu state Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adolphus Udeh has mocked the PDP over its pledge to rescue Nigeria.\n\nUdeh said before rescuing Nigeria, PDP should first account for its 16 years of uncountable underdevelopment obstacles the party embedded in the system prior to their exit from power in 2015.\n\nIn a press statement released Sunday to Blueprint in Abuja, Udeh said he closely observed the PDP convention where speaker after speaker lampooned the APC and claimed they were on a rescue mission.\n\nHe blamed the current socio-economic challenges confronting Nigeria under the APC government on PDP\u2019s 16 years of misrule.\n\n\u201cIs it not better PDP starts by first accounting for uncountable underdevelopment obstacles they embedded in the system before their exit in 2015? PDP acted like tenant who wrote favourable contract agreement for itself against Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTake the power sector for instance where the contract agreement between Federal Government and DisCos and GenCos are in favour of the private companies. PDP weaved these skewed contract agreements and in fact nominated those less than efficient companies,\u201d Udeh said.\n\nHe said President Buhari cannot just wake up and cancel the contracts(power sector), stressing that \u201cit takes time to unbundle the less than transparent clauses in the contract, no matter how faulty, otherwise, the media would accuse him of dictatorship and blame him for scaring off foreign investors.\u201d\n\nOn why it is taking the APC-led federal government to clear the \u2018mess\u2019 six years after, Udeh explained that democracy has its own speed, due process and checks and balances.\n\n\u201cThe outcome is gross unemployment and waste of public funds as the Federal Government was compelled to invest over N1 trillions to patch up.\n\n\u201cAccording to IMF, Nigeria yearly loses $29 billion, which is 5.8% of her GDP, due to lack of reliable power supply.\n\n\u201cAnd listen to the President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwunmi Adesina, who blamed poor electricity value chain sector for the sorry state of our industrial development,\u201d the APC leader said.\n\nHe, however, said they were happy that the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, an engineer, has an answer to the intractable problem in the electricity value chain.\n\nQuoted the power minister, Udeh said: \u201cIt must be clearly stated that within this value chain, some responsibilities are by virtue of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act (EPSRA) performed by our private sector partners and other agencies of government.\n\n\u201cThese partners are being monitored and sometimes given the needed nudge in the right direction to achieve our objectives. We shall be taking a careful and detailed look at issues of policy, capacity and the technical requirement, among other things.\n\n\u201cOne very critical concern that we must address in this performance monitoring process is to find out if the terms for granting the licenses were onerous.\u201d",

The SME sector stimulates growth and development within the economy.\n\nNBS data\n\nAvailable data from Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that SMEs in Nigeria have contributed about 48 per cent of the national GDP in the last five years, account for 96 per cent of business and 84 per cent employment.

Olamilekan Adegbite in his keynote address said the launch of the Nigerian Barite was a culmination of several efforts and collaboration with critical stakeholders in the sector.\n\nWhile appreciating President Muhammadu Buhari for the unwavering support he has given to the mining sector, Adegbite noted that the current administration has demonstrated an unflinching commitment to the growth of the sector.\n\nThe Minister highlighted some of the benefits of the Nigerian Barite initiative to include; accelerated development of the sector along the Barite value chain; Increased revenue to Government through Royalty payment and Conservation of foreign exchange hitherto spent on importing barite.\n\nOthers he mentioned were; Job creation along the Barite value chain and Local Content promotion in line with federal government policy.\n\nAdegbite added that the launch of Nigerian Barite was poised to save the country millions of dollars spent importing barite.\n\nHe said a major component of the initiative was the promotion of local content in the production, quality assurance, and sale of Barite.\n\n\u201cThe bags of barite we are presenting today meet the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard, which is the global bench mark accepted by the oil industry\u201d, he explained.\n\nThe Minister recalled that barite was among the seven strategic minerals designated for top priority development by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe said Barite occurs within the Benue Trough (Benue, Taraba, Adamawa States) and its fringes to the north (Nassarawa, Platueau and Gombe States) and the Southern fringe (Cross River State).\n\nHe however cited a major exception of occurrence in Zamfara State, Northwestern Nigeria.\n\nHe disclosed that an open market place Portal that would connect all stakeholders along the Barite value chain would soon be commissioned.\n\nIn his words, \u201c the open market place portal would connect all stakeholders along the Barite value chain to a hub that allows for easy coordination, stocking, effective costing and seamless sale of Barite while the Ministry would assume the role of coordinating the entire process.\u201d\n\nAdegbite further explained that the open market place solution would be integrated with the Treasury Single Account, TSA, to ensure prompt remittances of government revenue\n\nIn his speech, the Executive Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr (Mrs) Ipalibo Harry-Banigo, congratulated the Ministers for the feat achieved while thanking them for choosing the State for the launch.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Minister of State, Dr Uchechukwu Ogah said Barite is one among the over 44 solid mineral types found within the country, which have mostly remained unexploited.\n\nHe said the launch of Nigerian Barite is an attestation that the Ministry\u2019s investment in exploration activities and capacity building targeted at sustainable production of Nigerian processed Barite has finally paid off.\n\n\u201cIn our commitment to deliver on Mr. President\u2019s mandate, we have not only rejigged our Vision and Mission but have developed and adopted new reform initiatives and innovative strategies to ensure optimal performance and sustainable growth in the minerals and metal sector\u201d, he further explained.\n\nIn her closing remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Dr (Mrs) Oluwatoyin Akinlade said the Ministry aligned with the strategic and visionary diversification agenda of the President through the roadmap to completely rejuvenate the sector for national prosperity.\n\nShe acknowledged the unwavering parliamentary support of the National Assembly.\n\nThere were goodwill messages from CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, the Group Managing Director NNPC Mele Kyari, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote and a presentation by the Director General Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, Dr Garba Abdulrazaq.\n\nBarite is a mineral that is very vital to the development of the Nigerian oil and gas sector. It plays essential role as a weighing material in drilling muds used in oil and gas drilling primarily to prevent the explosive release of gas during drilling. It is also used in the plastic, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, paper making and paint industry.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA former President of the Senate, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, has emerged as the new National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nSenator Ayu, a consensus candidate for the position, took over the leadership of the main opposition party alongside 20 others elected into various positions within the PDP National Working Committee.\n\nThe new set of leaders were elected at the party\u2019s national convention which began on Saturday and lasted till the early morning of Sunday.\n\nHundreds of party delegates participated in the election of the new national officers at the Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\n\u201cVery significantly is for me to have the privilege as the Chief Returning Officer of the 2021 PDP National Convention Election Chairman to announce and declare His Excellency, Senator (Dr) Iyorchia Ayu as duly elected and returned National Chairman of our great party,\u201d said Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State while announcing the results of the elections.\n\nShortly after he was announced as the new chairman, Senator Ayu walked downed to the podium in company with some governors in the party to give a brief remark.\n\n\u201cI want to sincerely appreciate the PDP family,\u201d the elated new chairman said. \u201cToday is simply a thank you address. When we started this party 23 \u2013 24 years ago, we never in any way imagined that the journey will get us to this stage \u2013 a stage where we ruled for 16 years, we went into rough times but for anybody who will bother to see, PDP is back.\n\n\u201cAnd it is back to rescue Nigeria from the terrible mess we have been in the last six years. I want to appreciate all of you who have taken time as delegates, as observers, as supporters, as members of the media, as members of the security services, who have made this event such a wonderful event.\u201d\n\nA Truncated Tenure?\n\nFollowing the crisis that rocked the Uche Secondus led National Working Committee of the party, the PDP had announced a special convention to elect a set of new national officers.\n\nThis decision by the party, however, did not go well with Secondus \u2013 the suspended PDP National Chairman \u2013 who believes the conduct of the convention will abruptly end his tenure that is due to expire in December.\n\nHe, thereafter, went ahead to file an application at the Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt, Rivers State to stop the PDP from proceeding with the convention as planned, as part of the processes in the ongoing litigation over his suspension from the party.\n\nBut Secondus lost the bid to stop the convention from taking place as the ruling delivered by the appellate court on Thursday clear the coast for the party to go on with the exercise. He vowed to challenge the ruling.\n\nWhile Bayelsa State Governor served as the Co-Chairman of the PDP National Convention Election, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State is the Secretary.\n\nSee the full list of the newly-elected national officials of the main opposition party below:\n\nNational Chairman \u2013 Iyorchia Ayu\n\nDeputy National Chairman (North) \u2013 Umar Damagum (Contested)\n\nDeputy National Chairman (South) \u2013 Taofeek Arapaja (Contested)\n\nNational Secretary \u2013 Samuel Anyanwu (Unopposed)\n\nNational Treasurer \u2013 Ahmed Mohammed (Unopposed)\n\nNational Organising Secretary \u2013 Umar Bature (Unopposed)\n\nNational Financial Secretary \u2013 Daniel Woyegikuro (Unopposed)\n\nNational Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Professor Stella Effah-Attoe (Unopposed)\n\nNational Youth Leader \u2013 Muhammed Suleiman (Contested)\n\nNational Legal Adviser \u2013 Kamaldeen Ajibade (Unopposed)\n\nNational Publicity Secretary \u2013 Debo Ologunagba (Unopposed)\n\nNational Auditor \u2013 Okechuckwu Daniel (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Secretary \u2013 Setoji Kosheodo (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Treasurer \u2013 Ndubisi David (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Publicity Secretary \u2013 Ibrahim Abdullahi (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Organising Secretary \u2013 Ighoyota Amori (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Financial Secretary \u2013 Adamu Kamale (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Women\u2019s Leader \u2013 Hajara Wanka (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Youth Leader \u2013 Timothy Osadolor (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Legal Adviser \u2013 Okechukwu Osuoha (Unopposed)\n\nDeputy National Auditor \u2013 Abdulrahman Mohammed (Unopposed)",

          "text": "Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State has commissioned the Anambra International Passenger and Cargo Airport for commercial operations.\n\nThe commissioning took place on Friday much to the delight of the public.\n\nThis came as the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the country\u2019s aviation regulatory body, refused to approve the takeoff of two commercial flights scheduled to land at the airport from Lagos and Abuja, respectively.\n\nObiano said: \u201cI thank Buhari for approving this Airport, also Sidika for the oversight activities he did here, and also Nuhu of NCAA.\n\n\u201cThis airport has been certified and has met all needs for commercial purposes. Unfortunately, the flights that were fully booked for today, both from Abuja and Lagos could not come because the regulatory authorities said the commercial airlines that will operate here will need to have counters here before operations will start.\n\n\u201cThe airlines that will operate in this airport include Air Peace, Ibom Air, Dana Air, United Nigeria Air and Anab Jets. They will have to set up their counter before flights will commence.\n\n\u201cThe dreams we have nurtured for 30 years have come true today. We fought many battles to be here today, including COVID lockdowns. I have been assured by aviation experts that this is going to be the most viable airport in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NCAA had previously approved the landing of seven planes. We need a man with a great deal of vision to take over the state and steer the ship, and Soludo is that man. Our state is on the runway, and we need a capable hand to pilot it, and our state is in good hands with Soludo in the cockpit.\u201d\n\nFormer chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Victor Umeh, who spoke during the commissioning alluded to some sabotage in the landing of the already booked commercial flights.\n\nUmeh said: \u201cTickets had also been sold out since three days ago. If they are people who think they will lose the election if planes land here today, then they should know that whether plane lands or not, they have already lost the election. It shall be well with Anambra, let no one toy with our destiny. The best thing we can do for ourselves is for Soludo to succeed Obiano.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy you (Obiano) never lowered the standard of APGA. You started well and have continued from where Obi stopped. You have served very well and the people are seeing what you are doing. Today\u2019s commissioning of the airport is yet another of your dreams and you have brought it to fruition\u201d.",

          "text": "The world\u2019s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, reported $30.4 billion in third-quarter net income on Sunday, bolstered by a surge in oil prices and recovery in demand as the coronavirus pandemic eases.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s majority state-owned oil giant Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., said its net income more than doubled from $11.8 billion during the same three-month period a year earlier. Last year\u2019s figure came after profits plunged dramatically as global lockdowns slammed oil prices. Net income refers to the amount left after taxes and preferred dividends have been paid.\n\nAramco CEO Amin Nasser described the company\u2019s third-quarter results as \u201cexceptional,\u201d a result of \u201cincreased economic activity in key markets and a rebound in energy demand,\u201d even as supply chain bottlenecks imperiled the global economic recovery.\n\nThe 158% spike in earnings follows the global loosening of virus-induced restrictions, tightening of gas supplies and acceleration of vaccination campaigns that have pushed prices of crude sharply higher. The price of international benchmark Brent crude was trading at over $83.50 a barrel on Sunday.\n\nConsumers and companies are using more gasoline and airplane fuel as governments relax restrictions, leading to a rally across energy markets.\n\n\u201cWe are optimistic that energy demand will remain healthy for the foreseeable future,\u201d Nasser said.\n\nCrude prices have been helped by production cuts made by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, which meets later this week.",

          "title": "Japan Votes in Test for New PM Kishida, Political Stability",
          "text": "Japanese voters went to the polls on Sunday to decide whether to endorse the conservative government of Fumio Kishida or weaken the new prime minister and possibly return the world\u2019s third-largest economy to a period of political uncertainty.\n\nThe vote is a test for Kishida, who called the election soon after taking the top post early this month, and for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been battered by its perceived mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAlready, Kishida has struggled to advance policies to help poorer people, while securing a big boost in military spending and taking a harder line on China.\n\nWith his lacklustre image failing to inspire voters, the LDP is on the brink of losing its majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time since 2009, opinion polls show, although its coalition with junior partner Komeito will stay in power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say the pandemic is completely snuffed out and society is stable, so we shouldn\u2019t have any big changes in coronavirus policy,\u201d said Naoki Okura, a doctor, after voting in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cRather than demanding a change in government, I think we should demand continuity.\u201d\n\nVoting ends at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), with projected results likely to come soon afterward from media exit polls.\n\nTOUGH CONTESTS, REVOLVING DOOR?\n\nSeveral key LDP lawmakers are facing particularly tough contests, including Akira Amari, the party\u2019s secretary general.\n\n\u201cRevolving-door prime ministers is a weakness that many outside of Japan fear,\u201d Sheila A. Smith, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a blog post. \u201cPrime Minister Kishida will need a unified party and a strong electoral showing on Oct. 31 if he is to successfully tackle Japan\u2019s difficult national agenda.\u201d\n\nTurnout will be crucial, since higher turnout tends to favour the opposition. As of 2 p.m., turnout stood at 21.49%, down 0.34 point from the previous lower house poll \u2013 but 16.6 million voted in advance, the Internal Affairs Ministry said.\n\nThe biggest opposition group, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, is expected to gain seats but not come near toppling Kishida\u2019s coalition.\n\n\u201cThe only party with policies aimed at people in their 20s and 30s is the Constitutional Democrats, things like income tax and so on,\u201d said office worker Daisuke Matsumoto, 27. \u201cIt\u2019s true other parties have policies aimed at child-raising, but what about those of us who are childless?\u201d\n\nA big loss of LDP seats could lead to party infighting, returning Japan to an era of short-lived administrations that diminished its global stature, until Shinzo Abe helmed the country for a record eight years to September 2020. The dovish Komeito could also gain more clout within the coalition.\n\nUncertainty is high, with the Nikkei newspaper estimating 40% of single-seat districts have close races and recent polls showing some 40% of voters undecided.\n\nKishida\u2019s publicly stated goal is for his coalition to keep a majority, at least 233 seats, of the 465 in the lower house. Before the election, the coalition had a commanding two-thirds majority of 305, with the LDP holding 276.\n\nInvestors and political watchers are focussed on whether the LDP \u2013 in power for all but brief spells since it was formed in 1955 \u2013 can keep its majority as a single party. Losing that would erode Kishida\u2019s power base in the factional LDP and the party\u2019s standing against the Komeito.\n\nThe usually splintered opposition is united, arranging for only one party \u2013 including the widely shunned Japanese Communist Party \u2013 to face off against the coalition in most districts, with analysts saying this is creating a number of neck-and-neck battles.\n\nBut the opposition has failed to capture the hearts of voters, with only 8% supporting the Constitutional Democrats while 39% back the LDP, according to a poll last week by public broadcaster NHK.\n\nStill, some voters \u2013 like Yoshihiko Suzuki, who voted for the Constitutional Democrat in his voting district and the Communists in proportional representation \u2013 hoped the poll might teach the LDP a lesson.\n\nSuzuki, 68 and retired, said Abe\u2019s eight years in power made the LDP complacent and arrogant, underscored by a series of money and cronyism scandals.\n\n\u201cI hope this election comes as a wakeup call for them,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it does, the LDP will become a better party, considering the number of talented lawmakers they\u2019ve got.",

          "title": "Again, Nigeria Extends NIN-SIM Verification Deadline to December",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, on Saturday conveyed the approval of the federal government to extend the deadline for the National Identity Number (NIN)-Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) data verification, from October 31, 2021 to December 31, 2021.\n\nPantami, in a statement jointly signed by the Director, Public Affairs, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde and the Head, Corporate Communications, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Mr. Kayode Adegoke, urged Nigerians and legal residents to complete the process before the end of 2021.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the decision to extend the deadline was due to the appeals by the Mobile Network Operators and other industry stakeholders, for further extension to ensure better compliance with government\u2019s directive and to avoid widening the digital divide.\n\nHe said the extension would also provide the enabling environment for the registration of Nigerians in remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, as well as foreigners, diplomatic missions, and those in other areas that were hitherto unreachable.\n\nThe minister added that the extension will also help to increase enrolments in countries with a significant number of Nigerians.\n\nYesterday\u2019s extension of the deadline was the ninth extension by the federal governmen since the directive on NIN-SIM verification and linkage was issued in December 2020.\n\nFollowing the inability of Nigerians to meet up with the initial December 31, 2020 deadline, the federal government had continued to extend the deadline.\n\nGiving the review of the progress of the NIN-SIM registration and verification exercise, Pantami said over 66 million unique National Identity Numbers (NIN) have been issued- an indication of progress achieved in the ongoing NIN-SIM linkage.\n\nHe however said a significant part of the populace was yet to be registered into the National Identity Database (NIDB), which he said, may be due to some challenges which the federal government had looked into and had made efforts to alleviate, hence the need to extend the deadline.\n\n\u201cAs of October 30, 2021, there were over 9,500 enrolment systems and over 8,000 NIN enrolment centres within and outside the country. This has significantly eased the NIN enrolment process and subsequent linkage of NIN to SIM. The NIN-SIM verification process is supporting the government\u2019s drive to develop Nigeria\u2019s digital economy, strengthen our ability to protect our cyberspace and support the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, has graciously approved the extension to accommodate the yearnings of the populace and make it easier for its citizens within and outside the country, and legal residents to obtain the NIN and link it with their SIM. The federal government will ensure that all innocent, law abiding citizens and residents will not lose access to their phone lines as long as they obtain and link their NIN. Government will also continue to provide an enabling environment for investors in the telecommunications sector,\u201d Pantami explained in the statement.\n\n\u201cThe unique 66 million NIN enrolments, with an average of three to four SIMs linked to the NIN, is a testament to the commitment and dedication of the federal government, through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), to ensure the success of the project. With the creation of additional NIN enrolment centres within and outside the country, and many more coming up, the remaining citizens and legal residents living in the country and the diaspora should be able to obtain their NINs and link them with their SIMs before the end of the year.\u201d\n\nPantami therefore enjoined Nigerians and legal residents to make use of the opportunity of the extension to enrol for their NINs and link with their SIMs before the end of the year 2021.\n\nEmma Okonji",
