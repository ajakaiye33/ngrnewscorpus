          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Consultant Psychiatrist at the Drug Abuse Unit, Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Aro, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Dr. Sunday Amosu, has advised pregnant women to stay away from tobacco use, warning that babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are prone to suffering from repeated pneumonia within one year of their birth.\n\nAmosu said women who use tobacco in pregnancy are at risk of giving birth to children with birth defects such as cleft lips.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, though pneumonia is a preventable disease, it kills more children globally than any other infection.\n\nThe UN child agency says Nigerian children made up the highest number of those who died, with an estimated 162,000 deaths in 2018 \u2013 443 deaths per day, or 18 every hour.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, 19 percent of child deaths were due to pneumonia in 2018, and it was the biggest killer of children under-five in 2017.\n\n\u201cPneumonia is a deadly disease and takes so many children\u2019s lives \u2013 even though this is mostly preventable. And yet, this killer disease has been largely forgotten on the global and national health agendas\u201d, UNICEF said.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise as Nigeria joins the global community on Monday to mark the 2021 World No Tobacco Day, Amosu said available statistics show that about one out of every 10 Nigerians currently smoke cigarettes.\n\nThe theme for this year\u2019s commemoration is \u201cCommit to quit.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist said, \u201cThere are 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and 80 percent of them are in the low and middle-income countries including Nigeria. Women who smoke are, particularly at risk. We can look at the risk of tobacco smoking in pregnancy in terms of the risk to the baby and the risk to the mother.\n\n\u201cThe mother faces the risk that anybody that smokes whether male or female faces like lung cancer, chronic pulmonary diseases, ischemic heart disease, stroke. There is a great risk for the baby when it comes to tobacco in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that there is an increased incidence of cleft mouth and cleft lips among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Also, pregnant women who smoke may have a miscarriage and lose the pregnancy.\n\nAmosu pointed out that smoking in pregnancy can also lead to sudden respiratory distress and the death of infants.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cSmoking in pregnancy can also cause what is called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The baby will just develop acute respiratory syndrome while in the cot begin to breathe excessively and suddenly the baby will die.\n\n\u201cWe have also discovered that within the first year, the baby is prone to having repeated pneumonia which is the infection of the lung. We also need to be careful because even those who are passive smokers are also prone to these problems.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist urged all hands to be on deck to tackle the menace of smoking in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking about the 2021 World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organisation Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, says no fewer than 1.2 million people die annually due to exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nMoeti said this in her message to mark the day, stressing that the theme was to remind everyone that tobacco kills half of its users, and also harms nearly every organ in the human body.\n\nShe said that even smoking one cigarette a day can seriously harm a person\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cTobacco use can lead to lung, mouth, throat, oesophagus, stomach, bowel, and other cancers.\n\n\u201dIt increases the risk of chest and lung infections, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other conditions.\n\n\u201cThere is no safe form of tobacco\u201d, she said.\n\nMoeti said that of the 1.3 billion tobacco users globally, 60 percent have expressed the desire to quit.\n\n\u201dBut only 30 percent have access to the tools to do so successfully,\u201d she noted.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Making plant breeding a game changer",
          "text": "Agriculture is facing a lot of challenges. There is a campaign to promote the development and propagation of resilient crop varieties to increase yields. But, this will require improving the plant variety protection system, writes DANIEL ESSIET2.\n\nDespite that the industry has untapped potential, there is food insecurity. Supply of products is becoming a challenge due to growing population and climate change. There is, therefore, the need for high-quality seedlings. Several research institutions run crop breeding programmes to enhance food security, reduce poverty and improve health and nutrition.Their investments in crop improvement run into the millions of dollars and naira.\n\nFor stakeholders, innovations that can help farmers adapt to changing conditions and pest pressures have become critical.\n\nIf Nigeria is to compete on the global stage and achieve its potential, the Director-General of National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC), Dr Olusegun Ojo, noted that farmers should have access to improved crops that their competitors have.\n\nAt a virtual meeting, Ojo maintained that the food production system needed to evolve to help unlock the potential of the sector.\n\nHe spoke about the potential of plant breeding in terms of producing better yields and protecting the food supply from climate change, disease, and pests, which would hamper growers and threaten access to safe, abundant food.\n\nHe said the government was committed to strengthening plant breeders\u2019 protection to provide motivation and incentives to increase investment in research and development for the crop sector, giving our farmers greater access to newest crop varieties.\n\nOjo reiterated that providing healthy and high-quality seeds for farmers and enabling local production were an important objective of the Federal Government.\n\nIn line with this, the Council is driving breeding programmes to increase the rates of genetic gain and the scale of impact through the adoption of farmer-preferred, market-demanded and climate-resilient varieties.\n\nTo achieve this, it has fostered a closer cooperation between research institutes and universities, seed companies in the private sector, as well as multilateral seed companies.\n\nEnsuring high-quality seed production has become important and constitutes the foundation of resilient agricultural production. Ojo and other experts emphasised the need for a Plant Variety Protection (PVP) law to prevent intellectual property of seed breeders, from being stolen.\n\nThe absence of a PVP, the experts argued, would leave farmers with low-quality and adulterated seeds that are dangerous to crop production and food security.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhether it is developing a crop variety more resistant to disease, or a high-fibre crop that produces healthier oil, the sector has taken delivery of innovations that offer benefits to farmers, food processors and consumers alike.\n\nAt the moment, organisations such as the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) are bringing new plant varieties to the space.\n\nThe private plant breeding sector dominated by big multinational companies, such as Bayer, Syngenta and Corteva, offer highly productive seeds to farmers. To achieve this, an immense amount of time and investment are required.\n\nIn most cases, plant breeders spend 10 to 12 years working on a new variety. The protection of their works is important for commercial success and for farmers to have access to a wider variety of seeds.\n\nOjo said the existence of a PVP law would encourage plant breeders to develop superior varieties that would lead to the agricultural sector transformation.\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC) Act 21 of 2019 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari states the important need for the granting of plant breeders rights to be provided for in an Act of the National Assembly on plant variety protection,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate, on March 3, 2021, passed into law the PVP Bill, and it is awaiting presidential assent. The law will give the breeder exclusive control over the variety, right to use the variety, and encourages the development of better plant varieties.\n\nWhile the council and other stakeholders are driving the bill, opposition said it would promote Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).\n\nBut Ojo differed.\n\nHis words: \u201cI have listened to non-state actors try so hard to unintelligently link the bill to GMO or the subversion of farmers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThe bill has nothing to do with the advancement of GMO in Nigeria.There are laws and state agencies that have been given this responsibility and the PVP has nothing to do with that.\n\n\u201cSupporting the development of new plant varieties is an essential response to achieving food security and agricultural sustainability. Improved varieties are a necessary and cost-effective means of improving productivity, quality and marketability for farmers and growers.\n\n\u201cHowever, breeding new varieties of plants requires a substantial investment of skills, labour, material resources, money and time.\u201d\n\nLead Partner, Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Economic Development Initiative (SEEDI), Celestine Okeke, said: \u201cNigeria is, no doubt, ripe for a Plant Breeders Protection Law.\u201d\n\nHe argued that if writers had laws protecting their texts, artists had laws protecting their intellectual properties and authors had laws protecting their publications, plant breeders, who spend upwards of 12 months researching on plant varieties, should be protected by law too.\n\n\u201cThe poverty levels in the country, coupled with growing food insecurity and rising food prices call for immediate action to remedy the dearth of research and development in the seed sector.\n\n\u201cThe seed sector is the bedrock of the agricultural sector; without seeds, there cannot be an agricultural sector and without continuous research and development in the seed sector, there will continue to be an agricultural sector incapable of supporting our food security aspirations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bill would enable farmer\u2019s access wide varieties of improved plants that would result from breeding programmes that would be protected by the law and grant plant breeders intellectual property right over their materials.\n\n\u201cThis would spur them to invest more in plant breeding and it would greatly develop the sector,\u201d he added.\n\nOkeke noted: \u201cThe government and other African countries have been falling behind in investing in research understandably because our economy has not been as it used to be.\n\n\u201cIf private sector will invest in plant breeding, it needs a law to protect its investment in the same manner we have law protecting authors of book, we also have a law in the entertainment industry for musicians and film producers, in that same manner we need to have the PVP law, without that, we cannot sustainably develop the sector.\u201d\n\nPlant breeders should invest in the creation of new varieties to meet the requirements of the modern market, which demands improved quality, disease resistance, productivity and environmental awareness. It is common knowledge that IP protection helps to ensure a return on investment and prevents counterfeiting. Plant breeders\u2019 rights, much like other forms of IP rights, protect research and creativity.\n\nThe Business Development Manager, Eastwest Seed International, Hadiza Yaro, said the major reason for low yields in developing countries was lack of improved seeds because most of the traditional varieties have not been improved on for many centuries.\n\nShe said modern breeding had enabled farmers to have better and higher yields, and the varieties accounted for over 50 per cent of farmers\u2019 output, in addition to other practices such as the right fertiliser, technique and better pest and disease control.\n\nThe President, Nigerian Plant Breeders Association (NPBA), Prof. Chidozie Egezi, noted that breeders needed a stable and predictable framework of protection as new plant varieties were urgently needed to respond to the challenges of climate change and limitations.\n\nHe said NPBA had many plant breeders who supported the law, adding that Nigeria is a food deficit country, importing so much and spending several millions of dollars yearly to supplement production.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the food system of Nigeria, you consider how much we are producing locally and importing, Nigeria is a food deficit country, importing so much and spending several millions of dollars yearly to supplement our production.\n\n\u201cOne of the few challenges in the sector is the varieties that we grow in the country.\n\n\u201cThe law will promote and ensure we get the right kind of investment, it will also have a longer term effect on how farmers benefit from growing the right kind of variety; and it will reduce environmental stress like climate change, flooding and drought.\n\nThe Technical Adviser to the Director-General, NASC, Dr. Okelola Folarin, noted that a robust plant variety rights system would incentivise breeders to develop new varieties, thus contributing to growth and food security.\n\nHe added that the law would make it possible for breeders to take appropriate action against the unauthorised or unintentional outflow of their varieties overseas.\n\nOkelola explained that the law would give Nigeria the opportunity to collect royalties from countries using our materials, citing Malaysia who took oil palm seeds from Nigeria many years ago.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe gave oil palm seedlings to Malaysia many years back and they took the oil palm and went into research and improved on it. They protected the things that had come out of those efforts and today Malaysia is one of the leading countries benefiting from oil palm.\n\n\u201cIt will amaze you that the oil palms seedlings Edo, Akwa Ibom and Cross River states are buying are Malaysian oil palm seedlings. These are things we are supposed to be collecting royalties from. We are buying because they have added value to what they took from us. Why don\u2019t we improve on what we have then export it? Then wherever they use it, the money will be coming back to us. It will also stop breeders from leaving Nigeria to work in other places where they know they would get better benefit.\n\n\u201cIt took Ghana 22 years to pass the PVP law. Just recently, the parliament of Ghana passed a law and the president signed it. We have been misinformed by people against this bill for a long number of years.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the law provides steps for the registration of a plant variety.\n\nSo far, countries such as Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania have joined the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV).\n\nRecent studies have confirmed that the PVP system would increase food security; create a sustainable seed industry, which would enable farmers to access viable seeds for greater economic returns.",

In case Okowa is unaware of the political meaning of the word, he should get enlightened advise on the concept of Consociation, and its benefit to peace building in plural societies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added: \u201cIf however, all other Senatorial Districts are unwilling to respect the gentlemanly disposition of the Central Zone by conflating it for weakness, the deceptive words of Governor Okowa should be seen as a rallying call to all Urhobos, to demonstrate the collective resolve of the zone as was the case in 1992, between the SDP candidate Olorogun Felix lbru and Professor Eric Opia of the NRC, when the then Military Head of state, lbrahim Babangida decided that the latter must be the first executive governor at a time when the issue of the location of the state capital provoked anger in Urhobo land.\n\n\u201cThe people of the Central District took it as a challenge and came out enmass using our voting population during the election and defeated the Babangida decision that Urhobo should not be made the first executive Governor. The collective resolve of Urhobos made it possible for our late Olorogun Felix lbru to be the first executive Governor of the newly created Delta State.\n\n\u201cAs it was in 1992 so shall it be in 2023, as l call on all sons and daughters of Urhobo nation to begin the process of taking concrete and necessary legal and political steps to match the challenge to the zone invited by the governor\u2019s equivocative vacillation. This is the time for total unity of all people of the Central Zone, l urge all to unite as one Urhobo nation and rise up to this challenge as the majority ethnic group that should not allow itself to be oppressed.\n\n\u201cGovernor Okowa\u2019s declaration that power rotation to Central Senatorial District is uncertain should be taken as a challenge, a duty and a responsibility by the Urhobo nation by 2023.\u201d",

          "title": "Omo-Agege and challenge of power shift in Delta",
          "text": "The Secretary of the Board of Trustees, Ndoka Neku Union, Onotu Henry Okechukwu, contends that the mobilisation embarked upon by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege will culminate in power shift from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State.\n\nWhen at weekend, the entire Ndokwa nation comprising three Local Government Areas of: Ukwani, Ndokwa East and West converged on Kwale, the traditional headquarter of Ukwani speaking people of Delta State, hosted the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, it was a carnival of sort. It was a moment every politician with good conscience will desire\u2026for a man who represents a different Senatorial district to be so celebrated.\n\nThe celebration, to the people of Ndokwa was a show solidarity for a man who has made them know that quality representation is not impossible after all, perhaps they are witnesses to the wonders performed by the lawmaker in Urhobo land. Ndokwa people are notably agrarian struggling below poverty line and are badly tired of the PDP\u2019s fiefdom and have decided to follow the man we generally acclaimed as to lead us into a new era of accelerated growth and development come June 12, 2023 even though the DSP is yet to publicly announce his willingness to contest the 2023 gubernatorial election.\n\nSons and daughters of Ndokwa decided to give Obarisi Omo-Agege our crown of honour for doing us proud in the Senate being one of our best who was produced by the flagship of our citadel of learning \u2013 the great Saint Georges Grammar School.\n\nObarisi has shown more than enough interest in the matters of Ndokwa nation and other ethnic groupings outside his constituency because he chose to be a statesman driven by excellence as exuded over time from his rich pool of excellent ideas to develop a people as a against a clanish and ethnocentric leadership of the ruling PDP in the state.\n\nPenultimate Saturday precisely, I led a mammoth crowd to welcome our own Omo-Agege to Kwale who came on the occasion of receiving and welcoming the people of Ndokwa nation into the fold of the APC and that we achieved after our efforts yielded results.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe second leg of Obarisi Omo-Agege\u2019s visit to Ndokwa land was to inspect the site of the Okpai Power Plant project which was to step-down power supply to lighten up our nation, a contract awarded over 6 years ago, but has not seen the light of day due mainly to political shenanigans.\n\nIt goes to show how deep the interest of Ndokwa nation is in the mind of this rare gem who has turned a blessing to everyone notwithstanding the fact that we didn\u2019t vote him to be senate.\n\nFear of Omo-Agege:\n\nWhat happened at the entrance of Okpai community on Saturday the 29th of May when misguided youths unlawfully blocked the road daring the DSP and his entourage including senior officials of the Ministry of Power and Energy to enter the town was on the contrary a very great privilege for Deputy Senate President (DSP) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to showcase his innate qualities as a true leader.\n\nThe weird humility exuded by the Senator to address the rampaging youths who were acting the script of their party leaders not which was to block the DSP and the officials from entering into Okpai for official inspection of the Step Down of Power which was intended to change the ugly narratives of the by successive administrations was unraveled as returned his entourage to safety after several unprovoked attacks by the youths in Okpai.\n\nYouth strategy:\n\nOur youths are not unruly. Their respect for elders is immeasurable and they peace loving which is why they hardly engage in frivolities like we see in other parts of the country. Our youths notably hardworking, respectful and delight of any man goodwill.\n\nWhat happened was orchestrated by failed politicians in Ndokwa land and their collaborators in Asaba who have no Programme to better the lots of Ndokwa nation but will rather goad the youths into violence with pittance because they are deliberately impoverished to reduce them (youths) to their cannon fodders which the youths see as their comfort zone.\n\nThe Okpai Power project was ignited by an intelligent, purposeful and non-violent struggle for Power Step Down in 2005 when the team led by Jude Dike, Ndokwa Youth Congress, Ndokwa Youth Vanguard joined with the elders in the Ndokwa Leaders of Thought led by the late Prof. BIC Ijomah, and were later joined by Pages group being another Youth group, amongst others to drive the struggle against AGIP to the point of its eventual approval by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s APC administration.\n\nThe DSP is unarguably the highest political office holder in the Niger Delta region nay: Delta State and to this extent we hold him in the highest esteem and will condemn any action or inaction aimed at embarrassing our own vehemently.\n\nMy apology therefore is that on behalf of the entire Ndokwa nation, in my capacity as the Secretary of the BOT of NNU, I apologise for the gross misconduct of the youths who humiliated themselves at Okpai, along with their sponsors/backers.\n\nInfluence:\n\nIn the eyes of the law, unlawful blocking of the road to deny anyone access into any community, more so an entourage of the Federal Government led by the number five in the order of precedence of the Federal Government of Nigeria, is a criminal conspiracy, suspected threat to life, and attempted assassination.\n\nHowever, the erring Okpai youths, who were not faceless at the Okpai junction incidence, so that Justice may not officially take its course against this strange occurrence as a deterrent for future disrespect, not only for the person Senator Omo-Agege but more especially for the very high statutory office of the DSP.\n\nLeadership distinctions:\n\nThe incidence gave us the opportunity to admire more the quality of Omo-Agege\u2019s exemplary leadership as an exposure of your evident maturity in your preference for response as against any instant retaliation.\n\nTo DSP, observers were eager to rate the scale of competence in your reaction, and we were glad that you scored highest by making the right choice, knowing that Power without restraint is indeed useless. Thus, the DSP has shown that it is better to put power into appropriate USE, and not to abuse or misuse it.\n\nLaw and order:\n\nThe regrettable incidence at Okpai was rather a highly impressive outing because the provocation was an opportunity to witness the DSP put his life at risk for a peaceful, friendly and brotherly mediation that saved the precious lives of our erring Okpai sons who were ignorant of the huge consequences of their actions. Such a decision to be vehemently opposed to the option of violent confrontation and instant military response or intervention, meant the avoidance of collateral damage or any unnecessary loss of invaluable human life. It takes matured leadership to firmly decide to even protect the lives of those who unlawfully denied you access.\n\nIn the same light, I must also commend HRM the Igwe of Okpai, and the faithful APC leaders and members at Okpai who for sake of peace, restrained themselves from coming to Okpai junction to counter the Okpai Youths.\n\nConsultations\n\nIn spite of the Okpai incidence, the calmest and organised responses of the DSP at the IPP site in Kwale, and at the meeting with the Ikpalas and Onotu-in-Council of the entire Utagba-Ogbe Clan, rescued the burden of obstacles standing against the Power Step Down, off the shoulders of a \u2018Federal Representative\u2019 who lacks the high level capacity required at the Federal Government and has proven himself incompetent in the actualisation of the project; except pecuniary gains and building his political fortunes while the actualisation of this very vital project continues to suffer to its near abandonment.\n\nHope for better leadership\n\nDSP Omo-Agege promised to work with the distinguished Senator Peter Nwaoboshi to bring a Federal University of Health Sciences to Ndokwa Nation. The most important benefit of your visit is your willingness to assist in getting the Presidency, the Federal Ministry of Power and the National Assembly to see to the accelerated realisation of the power step down in Ndokwa Nation.\n\nProblems and solutions on the power project\n\nWith your pedigree in successfully actualising numerous projects across the Delta Central Senatorial District, we believe that you are indeed capable of surmounting the several prolonged obstacles mentioned by the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Power who was physically present at the Osemele project site. The solutions to the problems are not beyond the DSP, but very obviously beyond the capacity of an incompetent Federal Representative who has held the project captive for several years with only fencing of the site as an evidence of progress on the Substation sites. Personally, I know you to be surpassing in the uncommon beauty of integrity as a man who bonds with his word.\n\nEnding the avoidable marginalisation\n\nNdokwa nation pray that God keeps DSP Omo-Agege stronger and more courageous. The PDP is a dying horse throwing its last kick and we Ndokwa people won\u2019t allow the enemies of our nation blackmail us to surrender. We follow the DSP Omo-Agege and APC through thin. May His divine power help you to actualise your desires, and fulfill the promises made to Ndokwa as part of your list of priorities or very special projects. In this way, the entire Ndokwa Nation will be able to appreciate and magnify you for removing them from the marginalized status we have always been, due to our long list of selfish and underachieving political gladiators; since people are known to earn their respect for achieving result and not only making effort. Ndokwa-first is a genuine progressive mind that craves for \u2018success before profit\u2019.\n\nOnotu Henry Okechukwu is the Secretary, Board of Trustees, Ndokwa Neku Union, NNU",

          "title": "Nation-building, an unending task, says Fashola",
          "text": "By Raymond Mordi, Deputy Political Editor\n\nMinister of Works and Housing and former Lagos State Governor Babatunde Fashola (SAN) has praised the effort of one of his former aides, Paul Adeboye Kalejaiye, in documenting his experiences for posterity. With this, Fashola said Kalejaiye has joined the growing list of members of the State Executive Council 2007 to 2015, who have taken a step to document their experience in life and public service. \u201cBy doing so, their experience and insight would be available to the next generation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister who was represented by his former Chief of Staff, Chief Olanrewaju Babalola at the launch of Kalejaiye\u2019s autobiography said history will be kind to the author and others who served with him between 2007 and 2015 because \u201cthey shared a huge burden and gave so much of themselves and that made the task relatively easier to undertake\u201d.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor, however, urged them to continue in that spirit because nation-building is a never-ending task and \u201cin and out of office, the work never finishes\u201d. He said the title of Kalejaiye\u2019s book, Undeterred: The Pendulum Swings On\u201d, is a reflection of the lives of citizens as it concerns nation-building. Against this background, he spoke extensively on the responsibilities of citizens when it comes to nation-building, particularly given the challenges facing the country at the moment.\n\nFashola said: \u201cTherefore, because nation-building is an unending task, the pendulum of Nigeria must remain undeterred. We must keep working on the Nigerian project because the metaphoric clock of Nigeria must not and will not stop. It is our responsibility to see every step in our nation-building journey as another step to greatness; an opportunity to reinvent ourselves.\u201d\n\nHe said it is those men and women whose history is now folklore that kept the pendulum swinging and have thereby bequeathed present-day Nigeria to the current generation. He added: \u201cToday\u2019s challenges represent an opportunity for all of us in and out of government, to participate in what I believe would be a remarkable undertaking and write our names in the folklores of the up and coming generations.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I urge you all to see nation-building as a marathon and not a sprint\u2026 We must be willing to unlearn bad things and learn good things and we must enthrone good values and trust. We must cherish hard work and the reward it brings and discard the temptation to embrace inexplicable success and riches. We must value people for what they know and can contribute to community development and not value them for what they own.\u201d\n\nFashola described Kalejaiye in the foreword to the book as \u201ca loyal party man and great grassroots mobilizer\u201d. The man fondly called KAP by his friends and associates dedicated the book to his political mentor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for identifying and bringing him to the political limelight. He was Special Adviser (SA) to Tinubu on Rural Development, the chairman, Mobilisation Committee of defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) for the election that brought Fashola to power and also chairman, Finance Committee for Akinwunmi Ambode Campaign Organisation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe book launch coincided with Kalejaiye\u2019s 61st birthday anniversary. It was to have been launched last year to mark the author\u2019s 60th birthday, but with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of restrictions on mass gatherings, it had to be postponed. \u201cUndeterred: the Pendulum Swings On\u201d is a story of the author\u2019s childhood, upbringing, foray into politics and public service, amidst the vicissitudes of life. A humble and dogged personality, Kalejaiye, it is said, never allowed his humble beginning and the bitter experiences he encountered in life to deter him.\n\nIn his welcome address, Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman, Alhaji Tunde Balogun described the former Chief Executive Officer of Lagos Ferry Services as a warm personality who is ever ready to work. He added: \u201cKalejaiye is always smiling. I have never seen him wearing a long face.\u201d\n\nBalogun who was represented at the occasion by Funso Ologunde said within a short period he worked with Kalejaiye, the celebrant witnessed a few daunting challenges against him, which could have dampened his enthusiasm. However, \u201che absorbed them as if nothing happened\u201d.\n\nThe Dean, School of Transport, Lagos State University, Prof. S.G. Odewunmi, who reviewed the 168-page book that chronicles the life of the author from birth till date, commended the tenacity and courage shown by the author in the face of life challenges. He described him as \u201cexceptionally brilliant, diligent, and thorough\u201d. He described the author as a great model of perseverance and endurance.\n\nThe event was graced by distinguished personalities amongst them are captains of industries, politicians, academics and actors. Some of the distinguished personalities at the occasion are former Lagos State Deputy Governor (2007 to 2011), Princess Sarah Sosan; former Lagos Commissioner for Transport, Kayode Opeifa; Prince Rabiu Oluwa; Olasupo Shasore (SAN); and former Lagos APC spokesman, Joe Igbokwe.",
          "summary": "By Raymond Mordi, Deputy Political EditorMinister of Works and Housing and former Lagos State Governor Babatunde Fashola (SAN) has praised the effort of one of his former aides, Paul Adeboye Kalejaiye, in documenting his experiences for posterity.\nThe former Lagos State governor, however, urged them to continue in that spirit because nation-building is a never-ending task and \u201cin and out of office, the work never finishes\u201d.\nHe said the title of Kalejaiye\u2019s book, Undeterred: The Pendulum Swings On\u201d, is a reflection of the lives of citizens as it concerns nation-building.\nAgainst this background, he spoke extensively on the responsibilities of citizens when it comes to nation-building, particularly given the challenges facing the country at the moment.\nFashola said: \u201cTherefore, because nation-building is an unending task, the pendulum of Nigeria must remain undeterred.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFollowing the sit-at-home ordered by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) to commemorate the 54th anniversary of the declaration of the Sovereign State of Biafra, South East Governors\u2019 Forum Chairman, Dave Umahi, has said May 30 would be set aside as a day to remember millions of Igbo that lost their lives during the civil war.\n\nGovernor Umahi of Ebonyi State, who stated this during a television interview, yesterday, said there was the need to set aside a date to honour the Igbo who died during the three-year war, insisting there was nothing wrong with it. He said if a proposal to do so comes before the South East governors, they would give it consideration.\n\nExplaining the reason May 30 should be set aside in Anambra, Abia, Enonyi, Enugu and Imo states as a day to remember the dead, he said if the country can recognise June 12 as Democracy Day to honour MKO Abiola, winner of the 1993 presidential election, there was nothing wrong in setting aside a day to remember five million Igbo, including children who were killed during the war.\n\n\u201cPeople are beginning to say that even beyond the issue of sitting at home, there is a need to set aside a date to honour our brothers and sisters who died during the civil war and there is nothing wrong with doing that. If it comes before the South East governors, we would give it consideration and put conditions and one of them would be that if anyone decides to do otherwise, you must allow the person to exercise his or her rights.\n\n\u201cChildren, who didn\u2019t know the reasons for declaring the war were killed and we are saying we should have a public holiday for people like that. We are saying if our leaders bring such proposition to us and speaking for myself, we would grant that day as a public holiday but there must be a proper request for this in one of our meetings. I believe it would even be deliberated upon in our next South East governors\u2019 meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have June 12 dedicated to MKO Abiola, we also have a date set aside for our fallen heroes, so, there is absolutely nothing wrong with having a day set aside to mourn our dead but it depends on the motive because such a day is supposed to be a day of reflection.\n\n\u201cThe South East leaders would be willing to set aside May 30 every year to honour our dead. The significance of that day, if set aside, is for each and every one of us to reflect and ask if we should have done things differently. Yes, we were being killed and we were being maltreated but maybe there would have been an alternative. What is done is done and the man who led us said there shouldn\u2019t be a second war and that is where we are,\u201d Umahi said.\n\nOn the issue of insecurity, he said since President Muhammadu Buhari has directed that anyone found with an unauthorised AK47 should be dealt with, going forward, any armed herdsman seen in Ebonyi will be \u2018brought down\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe president has directed that anyone found with an unauthorised AK47 and is not a security agent, should be brought down and this is very important for the governors.\n\n\u201cSo, if you are a herder, whether you are an Igbo or Fulani or Ijaw and you are armed with an AK47 and you are coming to my place, even if it is with a stick, I would use it to bring you down, that is the order of the president,\u201d he said.",

There were also no human and vehicular movements within Abakaliki, the capital city.\n\nAn official of one of the banks at Awka, who sought not to be named, said in an interview with THISDAY that \u201cI am not in the office. The bank will not work for today. Who do you want to go to bank so that these people will come and kill them? I am at home. There is no movement and so who will you attend to?\u201d\n\nHowever, some people who defied the directive and went out in the early hours of yesterday returned home with injuries and their belongings destroyed.\n\nAll the streets were also deserted with heavy presence of security agencies and operatives of Ebubeagu at some designated junctions.\n\nViolence, resulting in sporadic gunshots and destruction of property, were witnessed in some parts of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe sporadic gun duel between the police and the agitators within Ebebe junction in Abakaliki capital city reportedly claimed five lives.\n\nWhile the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Aliyu Garba, confirmed that some of the suspected agitators were arrested, there was no official report on the alleged death of a policeman and four IPOB members.\n\nHowever, a source at the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, said the police brought in about four corpses to the morgue.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that some of the agitators divided themselves into groups and laid ambush in a forest along Ogbaga Road, where they intercepted anyone who flouted the directive on sit-at-home. They were said to have beaten up the violators and set their belongings ablaze.\n\nAn eyewitness said that many motorcycles were burnt while their riders fled with injuries.\n\nA student of Ebonyi State University also told THISDAY that the sit-at-home order disrupted academic activities.\n\nAnother school proprietor had also notified to parents and guardians earlier that the school would not open today.\n\nEmpty streets, deserted roads, closed shops and business premises characterised the observance of the Biafra Day in Umuahia, the Abia State capital and Aba, the commercial nerve centre of the state.\n\nResidents of the two major Abia cities fully complied with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe city centre of Umuahia was devoid of its usual bustling commercial activities as people remained in indoors.\n\nCommercial transporters also withdrew their vehicles, while private vehicles deserted the roads.\n\nGovernment institutions were also affected by the sit-at-home directive as schools and government offices did not open.\n\nBanks and other corporate businesses equally shut their gates.\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, there was no presence of the police and other security agencies patrolling the streets in Umuahia.\n\nThe separatist agitators also comported themselves peacefully while marking the Biafra Day as there was no street parade, which usually attracted heavy response from security agencies as happened on previous occasions.\n\nKanu had while giving directives on the observance of this year\u2019s Biafra Day strictly warned against any street protest, saying that people should stay indoors and mourn the fallen heroes.\n\nThe order also recorded total compliance in Enugu State.\n\nAs early as 8am yesterday, major markets within the Enugu metropolis, including Abakpa, New Haven, Garki, and Holy Ghost were shut.\n\nMarkets in Nsukka areas were also empty.\n\nMotor parks and other commercial places were equally deserted.\n\nStreets that were usually filled with people were empty even as there were no vehicular movements.\n\nPolice patrol vans were seen around Okpara Avenue, adjacent to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) office, Enugu.\n\nThe Enugu State Police Command had on Sunday, urged the residents of the state to disregard the order, warning that anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions would be dealt with.\n\nIn a statement made available to journalists by the Police Public Relations Officer, Enugu State Command, Daniel Ndukwe, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Mohammed Ndatsu Aliyu, had enjoined residents of the state to remain law-abiding, vigilant, as they went about their legitimate businesses.\n\nThe order also recorded 100 per cent compliance in Imo State.\n\nPrevious directives to mark the declaration of Biafra did not record the level of compliance observed in the state yesterday.\n\nAnalysts, however, attributed the total compliance this year to the heightened insecurity in the state.\n\nThe murder of a top chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former political adviser to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Hon. Ahmed Gulak, on Sunday morning had heightened the fears of Imo residents and forced them to stay indoors.\n\nAll the major streets in the state capital and every entry and exit points to and from the state were empty as motorists and travellers avoided passing through the state. The ever-busy Wetheral Road, Douglas Road, Royce Road, Okigwe Road, Orlu Road, Onitsha Road, Port Harcourt Road and Aba Road were all empty.\n\nHowever, security agents were alleged to have used the occasion of sit-at-home order to raid some of the hostels and lodges of students of Imo State University, Owerri (IMSU) to arrest some of them.\n\nA tweet from one of the student leaders had alerted the public to the arrest.\n\nEfforts to speak with the state Police Public Relations Officer, Bala Elkana, a Superintendent of Police, proved abortive as he did not answer calls placed to his phone.\n\nShedding light on why there was total compliance with the sit-at-home order, spokesman of the pan-Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Hon. Alex Ogbonnia, told THISDAY from his residence in Enugu that every Igbo person felt the sense of injustice against the Igbo in Nigeria and was a willing participant in the sit-at-home protest to register their displeasure.\n\nHe said: \u201cEven the governors of the South-east states know what is happening. It is a simple way of showing that the marginalisation of the Igbo is becoming unbearable. We are hoping the presidency will address some of these concerns. If for instance, an Igbo man is announced as the Inspector General of Police or Chief of Army Staff, the people will jubilate. If there is a consensus to cede the presidency to the South-east in 2023, all these agitations will die naturally. You can\u2019t continue to oppress a people who are very hardworking and contribute so much to the development of the country and expect them to celebrate their subjugation.\u201d\n\nAlso, President of Igbo Youth Movement, Mr. Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, said the refusal of the federal government to discuss with the agitators had strengthened their resolve to press home their demands.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe strange policy to only shoot and destroy the agitators without ever inviting them to present their position has convinced the people of this region that they are in a hostile political jail. The world over and all through history when between 5,000 and 10,000 people agitate about a situation the government of the land invites them to present their grievance. Nigeria is the only country where hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting over a particular situation in the last 21 years and the government continues to refuse to listen to them. Instead, thousands of them have been killed in cold blood.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Eight Abductions That Shook Nigeria",
          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction.

          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction. One girl, Leah Sharibu was not released by Boko Haram under the claims that she refused to renounce her Christian faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 300 schoolboys abducted in Kankara, Katsina in December 2020\n\n\n\nA gang of gunmen suspected to be bandits with links to Boko Haram terrorists attacked the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State to Abduct over 300 boys on December 11, 2020.

          "text": "New information available to SaharaReporters shows how the suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, lied to her superiors and sabotaged the plan by the Nigerian government to decongest Lagos ports by dredging the Calabar Port.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Usman lied to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Senate about the recommendations of a committee she had set up to investigate the dredging project at the Calabar Port.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nHer lies have cost Nigeria lives, billions of naira and jobs as Nigeria continues to rely on Lagos ports with its attendant congestion and other problems, it was also gathered.\n\nFor instance, widespread congestion at the Lagos ports costs Nigeria $55 million (about N20.8 billion) daily, according to a 2020 report by Dynanmar, a Dutch consultancy firm.\n\nAccording to sources in the industry, Usman consistently lied to Osinbajo, Chairman of the Presidential Task Team on the Apapa gridlock, tasked with the job of decongesting the Lagos ports, that dredging the Calabar Port was not viable.\n\nThe project is under Calabar Channel Management, a joint venture operation between a consortium led by Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited and the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nFollowing allegations that money was paid for dredging at Calabar Port with nothing to show for it, Usman set up a committee to investigate three allegations: One, that Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited did not follow due process in carrying out the job; two, that dredging Calabar Ports is not viable and must not be done; and three, that work was not done on the site by the company.\n\nThe report of the committee along with other documents sighted by SaharaReporters indeed prove that work had commenced at Calabar Port and that it was viable, but Usman ignored the report of the committee and insisted that the job must be stopped.\n\nSources privy to the issue said Usman took the position because he wanted the job for her cronies and not a neutral company.\n\nOne of the sources privy to the committee\u2019s report said, \u201cShe (Hadiza Bala-Usman) has been hiding the truth. The job was suspended after President Muhammadu Buhari came in. There were allegations that money was paid and that the job was not done. Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "For Rising Tide Africa, more African women should build diversified investment portfolios",
          "text": "Rising Tide Africa wants more women to be bolder at investment tables, to dream bigger and ask for more money to do bigger things. As told to me by Co- founder, Yemi Keri and Founding member, Ivana Osagie.\n\nWhen Ivana Osagie first started investing in startups, it was not entirely to make money for herself but out of a shared passion to help small businesses gain ground.\n\nThis meant that her investment efforts were without any knowledge of how things should work. So she did things without a proper framework, like weighing and diversifying her risks as well as evaluating her opportunities.\n\nBefore she could come to terms with this defect, the entrepreneur she invested with had disappeared with her money and she lost everything.\n\nWhile sulking over her loss, she stumbled upon angel investing and realised that it was what she needed to build her portfolio. Angels flock together for a reason,\u201d Osagie tells me on our Google call. \u201cBy investing alongside others, you get to diversify your risks to some extent, bringing certain expertise to the table. When you combine that with the expertise of other people, then you have a fuller picture of a startup.\u201d\n\nToday, Ivana is a founding member of Rising Tide Africa, an investment network that consists of a group of female angel investors harnessing their power, passion and capital to positively impact and actively create a new Africa.\n\nIvana Osagie: Founding member, Rising Tide Africa.\n\nWhat exactly does Rising Tide Africa do?\n\nFunded by private investors only, Rising Tide Africa was founded in 2016 by Co-founders Yemi Keri and Ndidi Nnoli- Edozien as a trans-border women-oriented investment network that engages in educating women to become angel investors. They do this through activities such as mentoring, networking and ultimately, offering opportunities for women to build a diversified portfolio of investments.\n\nRising Tide believes that it will bring about positive change by investing in the continent\u2019s exciting startups and next generation to create a new Africa.\n\nOsagie said that apart from investing money, they are also involved in other routines that aid the growth of the startups in their portfolio.\n\nWith every investing procedure comes other packages that involve mentoring and networking. She is of the opinion that investing isn\u2019t just about capitalism. \u201cWhen entrepreneurs come on board, we find that many times they\u2019re not investment-ready. So we need to work with them to get them investment-ready.\u201d\n\nThis process includes mentoring by industry experts and sharing a network of contacts.\n\nThis network of female investors has a mentoring team that works with founders to build business models, develop business plans and get a proper hold on the businesses. \u201cIt could be about helping them personally, for instance, learning how to communicate, how to stand in front of investors and convince them of the viability of the solution,\u201d she tells me.\n\nMuch talk about women empowerment\n\nAlthough the VC firm invests in female lead and gender diverse teams predominantly, there is a reason for this.\n\nIn the last decade, Africa has seen a massive explosion in the business sector, especially for tech-enabled startups. Early-stage companies and SMEs now exist in an exciting technology economy that is fast sprouting a lot of opportunities for business owners on the continent. But in all of these, there is still a limited opportunity pipeline for women.\n\nWhen it comes to access to finance, amongst other things, reports still prove that women aren\u2019t participating as much.\n\nGlobally, women\u2019s access to finance is disproportionately low. In 2017, according to this report, 65% of women had a financial account compared with 72% of men. Fast forward to 2021, not much has changed. In trying to determine what could still be the reason behind this, according to a World Bank report, the gap between men and women in developing economies remains unchanged since 2011, at 9 percentage points.\n\nOnly 37% of women have a bank account in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2017, compared with 48% of men with bank accounts.\n\nThe African Development Bank revealed that there is a $42 billion gender gap in access to finance. In Nigeria, for example, an estimated 50% of the population lives in extreme poverty and financial exclusion for women is only 36%. In bridging this gap, more organisations and startups are leaning towards gender balance in their operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not really a pretty sight, is it?\n\nThese reasons and more formed the foundation of Rising Tide Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to paint a different landscape. We wanted women to come to the table, to be bolder, to dream bigger dreams, and to ask for more money to do bigger things because we know that women have the capacity to do so.

          "title": "How Uche Ogboi became CEO of Lori Systems and her billion-dollar mission for African logistics",
          "text": "As CEO of Lori Systems, Uche Ogboi will bear some of the weight of African logistics on her shoulders.\n\nWhen Lori Systems started operations in Kenya in 2016, Uche Ogboi was nearing the end of an eventful eight-year career as an investment banker at Citi.\n\nShe had led the multinational bank\u2019s fund for small businesses and helped deploy billions of dollars for projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.\n\nA year later, Lori would be the star startup at TechCrunch\u2019s first-ever Battlefield Africa competition, winning $25,000. One of the judges at the event was Eghosa Omoigui, the founding partner at EchoVC Partners, a Nigerian venture capital firm. Ogboi had joined EchoVC as an associate principal, closing deals and helping the firm\u2019s portfolio companies figure out operations.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, first met Ogboi in 2017. When they met again in 2019, Ogboi was now principal at EchoVC and led the VC firm\u2019s investment in Lori\u2019s Series A round.\n\nHer due diligence process impressed Sandler who was looking out for someone to bring structure and help scale the logistics startup\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cShe was so incredibly structured and process-driven,\u201d Sandler says to TechCabal in a joint interview with Ogboi.\n\n\u201cShe understood what we were doing and pushed us in new directions. Lori needed her.\u201d\n\nJoining Lori and multitasking\n\nOgboi joined Lori as Chief Operations Officer (COO) in July 2019, four months before the Series A raise was announced. But in her first few months at Lori, Ogboi had to do more than be COO to immerse herself in the thorny business of logistics in Africa.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t functionally do the role until over a year in. I started by experiencing almost every role in the business because that was needed,\u201d she says.\n\nUche Ogboi. Image credit: Lori Systems.\n\nShe was on the field managing cargo departures and overseeing transportation. For a time, she filled in as the startup\u2019s chief financial officer and general manager for their operations in East and West Africa.\n\n\u201cThat experience has allowed me to work very closely and empathize with every part of the team, as well as with customers and transporters. I have seen the business from all sides.\u201d\n\nThis boots-on-the-ground experience of the business helped her understand logistics pain points. It clarified how technology will ultimately drive solutions that relieve those pains.\n\n\u201cFor our investors and stakeholders, I know and understand what it takes to scale Lori to become a multi-billion-dollar company on the continent.\u201d\n\nDeploying to Nigeria and saving costs\n\nOne of Lori\u2019s goals is to help clients save cost by up to 20%. While they have historically achieved that, Sandler credits Ogboi for some transformations that have happened since 2019.\n\nUntil Ogboi joined, the startup was largely an East African company in two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Mombasa) and Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Sandler ran the company with Jean-Claude Homawoo, as co-founder and chief product officer.\n\nAs part of her first task, Ogboi scaled Lori\u2019s official expansion to Nigeria in the second half of that year. In doing so, she increased competition in Nigeria\u2019s tech-enabled logistics sector which already included startups like Kobo360 and TradeDepot.\n\nAccording to Sandler, she grew the Nigerian business tenfold within that first year. In 2020, she kept the entire organisation lean when COVID-19 disrupted regular flow at borders, helping the company save 40% of costs and nearly doubling margins.\n\nBy mid-2020, Ogboi\u2019s actions in shaping Lori\u2019s adjustment to the pandemic led Sandler to have deeper thoughts about the startup\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw Uche in action, it became even more clear that as Lori continues to grow, she should be the person at the helm of this organisation,\u201d Sandler says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a quick decision but by December, conversations became more serious, setting a succession plan in motion that would lead to her appointment as CEO, with effect from July 1, 2021.\n\nA rare CEO leading an African first-mover\n\nSandler, a South African, will become Lori\u2019s Executive Chairman while Ogboi takes the wheel as the startup\u2019s visionary.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, will become Executive Chairman\n\nShe hopes to lean into her ten-year \u201ccocktail of experiences\u201d from investment banking through venture capital to drive Lori\u2019s mission of being the platform that makes every node in the logistics value chain efficient, thereby lowering haulage costs in Africa.\n\nSome factors like poor road infrastructure and policy inconsistencies will be out of her control.\n\nAs of 2018, the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index ranked Kenya 68th, Uganda 102nd and Nigeria 110th out of 160 countries.\n\nBut Ogboi\u2019s main anchor for changing the space \u2013 the focus of her leadership at Lori \u2013 will be further exploring the power of digital technology for logistics. At the moment, Lori provides clients with real-time information on goods and trucking assets through web-based apps.\n\nSo what\u2019s next on their technology roadmap: Internet of Things? Augmented Reality for warehousing? Blockchain for trucking?\n\nLogistics-tech companies like Lori may not solve Lagos traffic or build roads in Kampala. But they hope to exert influence through technology.\n\nOgboi does not give specifics. But she says they are working on some things over the next few months that will help them \u201cscale much quicker.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, it should be inevitable that someone as experienced should lead a mission as big. In reality, Ogboi is one of only a handful of female tech CEOs in Africa. She takes a deep breath and acknowledges the sad reality but knows she is in a position to drive more women up the ladder in other tech startups but especially at Lori.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has recovered from 2020\u2019s shock. It is back to its pre-COVID growth rates of 20% month over month. Last November, they received an undisclosed investment and signed a partnership agreement with Imperial Logistics, a global logistics company.\n\nSandler is confident that Ogboi will increase Lori\u2019s partnerships and relationships. Under his leadership, Lori helped move cargo worth billions of dollars; he looks forward to trillions with Ogboi in charge.\n\nNo pressure, huh?\n\nFor the new CEO \u2013 a mother of two daughters \u2013 it has been tradition to wake in the middle of the night to think about Lori. Now she\u2019ll probably sleep even less with the weight of African logistics on her shoulders. I prod and poke for what her first announcement will be. Convivial but coy, she only volunteers a general sign: \u201cwatch this space.\u201d",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Nigeria is reeling from the effect of the SIM registration ban, as mobile subscribers have dropped drastically in just four months.\n\nPooling data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Intelligence by Techpoint reveals that Nigeria lost 15.5 million subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nIn December 2020, the Minister of Communications & Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, through the NCC, suspended the registration of SIM cards by network operators in Nigeria. Here's a look at how the suspension affected the country's mobile subscriptions. pic.twitter.com/TdPYGSNAgM \u2014 Intelligence by Techpoint (@TechpointIntel) June 1, 2021\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria had 190 million mobile subscribers, but that number hit 192 million in March 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian government banned the sale and registration of new SIM cards and introduced a December 30 deadline for people to link their National Identity Number (NIN) with their SIM cards.\n\nIn retrospect, it is not clear if the government considered the risks of COVID-19, as that move coincided with a sharp increase in positive cases in the following months.\n\nMTN and Airtel\u2019s financial reports for Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 revealed that this policy would also hurt telecom companies. Both companies registered a reduction in subscriber numbers during the period in question.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s data all but confirms these numbers.\n\nIn November 2020, Nigeria had up to 207.9 mobile subscribers, but the country has witnessed a downward spiral since then, leading to the loss of over 15 million subscribers.\n\nCompared to previous years, this could be considered an abysmal showing.\n\nBy comparison, Nigeria gained 15.7 million subscribers between March 2019 and March 2020. From March 2018 to 2019, subscribers grew by a whopping 23 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NCC\u2019s subscriber numbers could perhaps be termed inflated, considering the data doesn\u2019t account for people holding multiple SIMs in different devices.\n\nConsequently, the actual number of mobile subscribers is much lower than what the NCC\u2019s records show. Though the regulator had plans to regularise the data in the past, nothing much came of them until the NIN order.\n\nThe subscriber decline in such a short time continues to raise questions about the size of Nigeria\u2019s addressable Internet market, as most of the lost subscribers are Internet users.\n\nPer the NCC, Nigeria lost 9.2 million Internet subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nWhile the data wars of 2019 and 2020 were particularly thrilling to observe, Nigerian telecom companies were on a losing streak in the three months between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nMTN was the hardest hit, with 3.8 million Internet subscribers lost. For context, MTN lost 4.8 million subscribers in total. This means about 70% of them were Internet subscribers.\n\nHistorically a formidable competitor to MTN in the data market, Airtel lost about 3.5 million Internet users. This is about 67% of the subscribers it lost in total.\n\nGlo fared way better than the first two, losing 1.3 million Internet subscribers, about 68% of the total mobile users it lost.\n\nSIM ban or not, 9mobile has struggled with the loss of its subscribers in recent years. However, it lost the least number of Internet subscribers at a respectable 701k.\n\nHowever, this number gets weird considering that it lost just 132k mobile subscribers. This would mean about 569 9mobile subscribers went offline during this period.\n\nThe loss of Internet subscribers by Nigerian telcos is also telling considering that, due to the pandemic, more people needed to be online to attend to their businesses, jobs, or education, but the SIM ban period might have been a stumbling block.\n\nThankfully, the ban has been lifted even though the NIN registrations continue.",

          "text": "Today, June 1, 2021, TalentQL is launching Pipeline by TalentQL, a specialised training programme for software engineers in Africa.\n\nDuring an interview with Techpoint Africa in November 2020, Adewale Yusuf, TalentQL CEO, revealed that Pipeline had been in the works since the company\u2019s inception. He discussed plans to launch the talent pipeline programme for training and upskilling junior developers in the first or second quarter of 2021.\n\nHowever, unlike the previous plan to focus on junior developers, this programme is focused on training and upskilling mid-level software engineers across the continent to senior software engineers.\n\nPipeline is Africa\u2019s first senior engineers\u2019 incubation programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrica suffers a dearth of senior software engineers. According to the IFC-Google report 2020, the continent has nearly 700,000 professional developers, but the ratio of junior developers to senior developers is quite disproportionate.\n\nThis narrative is not new to the African tech ecosystem as Andela \u2014 formerly a talent accelerator, now a talent outsourcing company \u2014 laid off 420 junior developers in 2019. The underlying thread behind this decision was the search for more senior developers to join its ranks.\n\nDuring our chat with Yusuf, he said, \u201cThe demand for senior engineers is at an all-time high. Up to 90% of our clients are seeking senior engineers. [But] most of the senior software engineers didn\u2019t pass our international clients\u2019 tests. So that\u2019s why we have to upskill them. Africa has enough junior engineers but not [enough] seniors.\u201d\n\nHe cites the largely self-taught developers littering the landscape, who \u201cdidn\u2019t train in a more structured environment,\u201d as the reason for this large skill gap. According to him, our education system doesn\u2019t prepare developers for the global stage.\n\nThis idea might not be far from the truth, as the IFC-Google report states that 31% of African developers are self-taught.\n\nAs Yusuf says, while there\u2019s a need to give African talents an opportunity, \u201cyou need more talent in the market to give opportunities.\u201d Hence the launch of this program.\n\nThe programme follows the Lambda School\u2019s model of a pay-later scheme, with participants not required to pay until they\u2019ve found the next opportunity after completing the programme.\n\nLambda\u2019s Income Share Agreements (ISAs) have come under severe scrutiny, with three students recently suing the for-profit company for issues relating to the contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we do not have the details of TalentQL\u2019s proposed arrangement, Yusuf believes the programme is sustainable, and its team of highly experienced professionals can handle whatever is thrown at it.\n\nPipeline will be entirely remote and will run a peer-to-peer learning format offering one-on-one mentorship provided by top senior software engineers working in some of the biggest tech companies globally, including Twitter, Tesla, GitLab, Amazon, and Google.\n\nThis model is different from the programme\u2019s initial model, which would have had a campus at Ile-Ife, Osun State. It seems plans for this campus have been put on hold for now.\n\nThe intensive six-month programme will not only focus on tech skills but \u201cwill also cover soft skills that are needed to compete in the global market.\u201d\n\nThese skills \u2014 team skills, client/user skills, and sales/interview skills, among others \u2014 are quite important in a software developer\u2019s journey to becoming a senior software engineer.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, \u201cWhat differentiates a mid-level developer from a senior developer is not just the technical skills but exposure to challenging projects, soft skills, and the right mentorship.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IFC\u2019s report, a minimum experience level of six years is required to be labelled a senior software engineer.\n\nYusuf says that TalentQL is accepting only the best intermediate-level engineers, thus closing the gap with a minimum requirement of three years experience.\n\nRegistration begins today, and there is a vetting process to ensure that only qualified candidates get into the programme.",

The virus has changed the way we live and interact with one another globally.\n\n\u201cIt is heartwarming today that we continue with our gradual return to our normal lives with the commencement of the second dose coronavirus vaccination. With this, we hope for brighter days ahead as we collectively fight to defeat the virus.\n\n\u201cThe second dose vaccination exercise commences today, June 1, and will last for 40 days, during which period we intend to get the vaccines to our people, including frontline workers who are 18 years and above across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the State.\n\nObaseki said the second dose is a booster dose which will provide full protection against the coronavirus disease, adding: \u201cThe flag off is important to create awareness in the state and boost public confidence in the safety and efficiency of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI took the first dose. Despite all the fears expressed, nothing happened. I am here today to flag off the second dose vaccination. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t take my second dose today because the time scheduled for me is not due. I will be due for the second dose on the 12th of June. However, some people have earlier dates. That is why the programme is launched today. I will take my second dose on the 12th of June and you will be invited to know the importance of the vaccination.\u201d\n\nNoting that the vaccines will be rolled out in phases, he said: \u201cThe first phase is now being administered to frontline workers, strategic leaders and the elderly; as scheduled for them. The second and third phase will follow and the rest of the eligible population will take turns to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the goal of his administration is to vaccinate about 70 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not been vaccinated, it is important to take the vaccine because by the end of June, it might be almost impossible to travel around the world without a vaccination certificate.\n\n\u201cGovernment alone can\u2019t fix this pandemic. We must all play our part by adhering to COVID 19 protocol to enable us to protect our loved ones, even after taking the second dose of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki seized the opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his support and role played in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that different stakeholders, particularly development partners, worked in synergy with the Edo State Government in ridding the state of the virus.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have vaccinated 38,500 people in the first phase of the first dose vaccination exercise.

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev.

          "title": "Asaba Declaration: Crossing the threshold of gullibility and division",
          "text": "By Obunike Nwosu\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Governors of the 17 states of Southern Nigeria met in Asaba, Delta State and resolved to ban the horrendous and anachronistic open grazing of cattle throughout their territory. They also called for the devolution of powers and for national dialogue to reset the country\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIt is a landmark that all Southern Governors could meet and take a uniform stand on national matters and have been supported by their National Assembly members, regardless of political party. The resolution has been widely endorsed in the North as well. Congratulations to all the participants and, in particular, to the Chairman of the Forum, Chief \u2018Rotimi Akeredolu, S. A. N., Governor of Ondo State, who has always demonstrated a rare strength of character.\n\nThe jinx has been broken but the journey to a united front has only begun. Southern leaders must now demonstrate that they are not as selfish, gullible and easily browbeaten as thought.\n\nWithout standing together, Southern Nigeria cannot muster the bargaining power to drag the country out of the path to perdition, in order to develop it (which should be the preferred option) or to secede from it (which may become inevitable) \u2013 despite the excellence of her people in the academia, the professions, public service, science and technology, commerce and industry, literature, music and the rest of the arts as well as sports and everything that makes the society tick, all around the competitive world.\n\nIn that case, the country would continue in crisis and in decline, their citizens will be stuck in the mess, their growth would remain arrested and they would remain second class citizens in the country they contribute the most to build, for whatever it is yet worth. Nigeria\u2019s redemptive potential for the black race would also be totally wasted. Therefore, this breakthrough should never be allowed to fizzle.\n\nBe it known, too, that the unity of Southern Nigeria is dreaded by the conservative Fulani-led Moslem North, who are set in their views about the rest of Nigeria as subordinate and have been in control of state power (directly or indirectly) by divide-and-rule tactics, since independence. In word and in action, they remain committed to the complete conquest and subjugation of Nigerians, begun by Jihad in the 19th Century, which the current leadership \u2013 knowingly or by default \u2013 has been facilitating.\n\nBut a people could be conquered only if they could be kept divided, as Southern Nigeria has perennially been. Thus, they are bound to resist the emergent Southern unity and would deploy blackmail, bullying, baits (including 2023) diplomacy and all sorts of wit to annul it.\n\nAlready, you can see the reprobate, self-righteous, master \u2013 servant, indignation of the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Malam Abubakar Malami, S. A. N., to the resolution \u2013 as if they are more patriotic than the Governors and as if the Governors have no knowledge of the law. Mallam Garba Shehu (a spokesman of the Presidency) went further to deploy a purported memorandum of the Minister of Agriculture, on the reactivation of grazing reserves and routes, to override the resolution of 17 Governors. What an affront and an insult!\n\nIt does not matter to them that the 17 Governors represent the half of Nigeria\u2019s population as well as the territory from which the revenue for running the country is derived. The deluge of blood and tears, flowing in the land, purportedly, for the sake of cows, does not move them. For all they care, you may die or relocate provided the primitive practice of nomadic herding is sustained, as Femi Adesina, another spokesman of the Presidency was once sent to advocate! It could mean that the herdsmen (who do not own the cows) are armed and sent on a mission and that the cows are baits.\n\nCuriously, the Secret Service and the Armed Forces and the Police, who are swift in smoking out EndSARS benefactors, IPOB and ESN members and camps and in extra-judicially torturing and killing suspects, have been incapable of locating the cells of the marauding herdsmen, bandits and kidnappers, not to talk of arresting and dislodging them from occupied communities and forests for restoration to the owners. As long as the President condones the atrocities \u2013 expressly or by body language \u2013 the Armed Forces and the Police will never move against them, regardless of platitudes. The Nigerian Armed Forces and the Police have more been slaves of the Head of State than defenders of the people, from inception.\n\nWhen the Federal Government has failed to act but, rather, is bent on seizing land (that is highly limited) in Southern Nigeria for Fulani settlements, for the sake of the same herdsmen, through the obnoxious Water Resources Bill, Rural Grazing Areas (RUGA) Grazing Reserves and Routes as well as the Nigerian Livestock Transformation Plan, e. t. c (while sidelining the clean solution of ranching in the North) who would not understand that a game is going on? What option did the Governors have under their limited powers than the Asaba Resolution? Or, should they simply watch their territory overrun?\n\nSince there cannot be a national Armed Forces and Police, Secret Service, Judiciary, Legislature and Civil Service (other than ones servile to the Head of State and his people) only the Aburi Accord of 1967 (or a confederation) can truly stabilize Nigeria. Under the Aburi Accord, for example, almost everything \u2013 from Resource Control to Agriculture, Education, Highways, Power generation and the Armed Forces and the Police \u2013 would be regionalized. Are Hisbah, Amotekun, Ebube Agu and Eastern Security Network (ESN) not pointing to the inevitability of the Aburi Accord?\n\nNigeria is a natural federate country. As a federation of regions in the 1960s, it was doing so well, socio-economically, that it was acclaimed as the future leader of the black race \u2013 until derailed by the greed of domination. Next, a confederation (Aburi Accord) was agreed in 1967 but was repudiated before implementation, which precipitated the Civil War of 1967 \u2013 1970, followed by other deviant behaviors and the obnoxious, predatory, Constitution of 1999 largely responsible for the current mess. The Governors are only affirming the call of the rest of Nigeria for true federalism and devolution of powers.\n\nBe it known that unless this Constitution and the supremacy mindset can be dispensed with and the Aburi Accord (or, at least, the structure for the socio-economic performance of the First Republic) is restored \u2013 so that everybody can breathe, can be weighed on the same scale and can substantially self-actualize \u2013 Nigeria is bound to suffocate to death, despite all the sentiment to the contrary. Instead of artificially sticking together and die, let us naturally move apart and prosper, as Ojukwu advocated at Aburi.\n\nOtherwise, an Oduduwa or a Biafran nation had better fill Nigeria\u2019s destiny in the world. Imagine that Biafra had survived. It would have become an industrial cum military complex comparable to Israel, South Korea, Turkey, India and China. All that Oduduwa or Biafra needs to do is to take money and rascality away from political office and enforce drastic laws against graft and nepotism \u2013 given that Africans, in general and Nigerians, in particular, have been incorrigible in the abuse of public office, whereas they serve their clubs, professional bodies and communities honorably, without pay. The remainder of Nigeria would be the better for Oduduwa or Biafra, given that prosperity is infectious \u2013 as was evident before the political crisis of the First Republic. The current system is unsustainable, by whatever means.\n\nObunike Nwosu wrote for Lekki, Lagos",
          "summary": "It is a landmark that all Southern Governors could meet and take a uniform stand on national matters and have been supported by their National Assembly members, regardless of political party.\nBut a people could be conquered only if they could be kept divided, as Southern Nigeria has perennially been.\nAs long as the President condones the atrocities \u2013 expressly or by body language \u2013 the Armed Forces and the Police will never move against them, regardless of platitudes.\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces and the Police have more been slaves of the Head of State than defenders of the people, from inception.\nUnder the Aburi Accord, for example, almost everything \u2013 from Resource Control to Agriculture, Education, Highways, Power generation and the Armed Forces and the Police \u2013 would be regionalized.",

This is our way of showing support and appreciating all their efforts in ensuring the safety of the rest of us.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the Chief Medical Director, National Hospital, Abuja, Dr. Jaf Momoh, who responded on behalf of the hospital management, remarked, \u201cIt is encouraging to know that organizations like 9mobile notice the efforts being made by health workers to give their best for the benefit of the society.

He said, \u201cIt gives me great joy to be recognized and appreciated for my little efforts in making society a better place for all. For me, this award and recognition is dedicated to all health workers in the country and particularly the management and staff of National Hospital Abuja for their encouragement and support. And to 9mobile, I am grateful for this honor done to me\u201d.\n\nDr. Ayinde is an alumnus of the University of Ibadan, where he obtained his MBBS.

          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria failed to address some critical national questions confronting the country, hence the resolve by the legislature to amend it.\n\nThe speaker also said that the constitution was not only the foundation of its existence but it\u2019s supposed to set the terms of the nationhood and define the manner that reflects her common truths and highest aspirations, noting that \u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard.\u201d\n\nHe said the reason for that was \u201cbecause the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in order to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement from the speaker\u2019s office, Gbajabiamila spoke in Lagos while declaring open the public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution, saying the National Assembly could only achieve the task after getting the inputs and support of the citizens.\n\nParticipants at the 2-day public hearing included the deputy governor of Lagos State, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, who represented Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; members of the House of Representatives Special Committee on the Review of the Constitution; members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC); representatives of political parties, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), youth organisations and market women.\n\nThe speaker said though the current exercise is not the first of its kind, it might be the most important one in the nation\u2019s recent history as the decisions to be made would have far-reaching consequences for the future of Nigeria.\n\nIn response to the doubts expressed in some quarters about the exercise, the Speaker noted that there was no perfect constitution anywhere in the world, but that it was imperative for Nigeria to have a near-perfect constitution to enable the country to confront and resolve many of its political, economic and socio-cultural challenges.\n\nThe Speaker, therefore, urged Nigerians to participate fully in the ongoing process so that their inputs would be captured for the country to have a new direction, adding that they could not afford to miss the opportunity of addressing their challenges and sustaining their future at this critical moment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe assured Nigerians of the sincerity of purpose of the 9th National Assembly to deliver a reviewed constitution that everyone would be proud of.\n\nThe Speaker stated, \u201cThe foundational constitution of the United States of America deemed people of colour to be \u2018less than\u2019 and denied women the right to vote. It did not include any limits on the President\u2019s term of office and allowed for citizens to be denied the right to vote for failure to pay the \u2018poll tax\u2019. Twenty-seven reviews and amendments, over one hundred years cured these and other defects.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cWe will not be able to deliver on this historic assignment if we restrict ourselves to tinkering around the edges of the constitution or by imposing upon ourselves artificial redlines that restrict honest conversation.\n\n\u201cAll of us in the House of Representatives will work conscientiously and in good faith so that it may be said of us in this process that we made an audacious attempt at creating for our nation a constitution that recognises our diversity and draws strength from it, and addresses once and for all, the fault lines that distract from nation-building.\n\n\u201cIt is all too clear that many of our citizens have come to expect too little of our politics and government. We are suffering from the tyranny of low expectations and the cynicism that causes us to believe that the political process cannot produce anything worthy or worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI understand the causes of this cynicism, but I refuse to share in it. I still believe that politics and government in Nigeria can be a force for good and that by our common endeavour we can achieve the vision of a just, peaceful, and prosperous society.\n\n\u201cHowever, beyond these Public Hearings, you still have an opportunity to make submissions that will be considered and that will help this process achieve the best outcomes. Please, by all means, participate.

Sanwo-Olu, a special status for Lagos State must be a concern not for the people of Lagos State alone.\n\nHe commended the leadership and members of the National Assembly for responding to the concerns of Nigerians on the need to carry out a review of the 1999 Constitution to reflect the current realities as a nation.\n\nAccording to him, true democracy is all about the exercise of the sovereign will of the people and the voices and wishes of the people must always be heard loud and clear.\n\nThis is regarding how they are being governed and how they wish to be governed.\n\n\u201cThis constitutional amendment process will provide Nigerians the opportunity to express their minds on the issues that must be reflected in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis is either by way of amendment to existing provisions or entirely new provisions,\u2019\u2019 Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nHe said that it was very necessary to subject constitution to a constant process of review and updating to ensure that it keeps up with changing times and contexts.\n\nThe review committee is considering over thirty constitutional alterations bills which border on Electoral matters, Local Government, Judiciary and Fundamental Human Rights.\n\nOthers include gender equity, increased participation of women, vulnerable groups in governance, immunity as well as indigeneship and residency.\n\nAlso, devolution of power, strengthening the independence of institutions, traditional institutions, State and Local Governments creation as well as Legislature and legislative bureaucracy among others.",

          "text": "Femi Gbajabiamila, Speaker of the House of Representatives, has announced that Nigeria\u2019s 1999 constitution must be revised since it was rushed into being.\n\nHe claimed that the constitution is unfit for purpose, describing it as \u201cthe product of a hasty national compromise\u201d designed to get the soldiers back to the barracks.\n\nGbajabiamila, who spoke at a zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution on Tuesday in Lagos, stated that a better constitution that represents the interests and aspirations of the Nigerian people is required to address the country\u2019s difficulties.\n\nIn his words, \u201cA nation\u2019s constitution is the foundation of its existence. It is supposed to set the terms of our nationhood and define who we are in a manner that reflects both our common truths and highest aspirations.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard because the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in other to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was always the intention that we will one day as one people and one nation, return to amend this document so that it gives voice to the yearnings of the Nigerian people and sets out in clear details how we intend to achieve the shared ambitions of our nationhood. Providence has cast upon the 9th National Assembly the responsibility to write such a constitution for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThough he acknowledged that amending the constitution will be difficult, the Speaker stated that it is a work that must be completed in order to improve Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one.\n\nGbajabiamila added that a constitution review will offer the opportunity to \u201crestructure our government to make it more effective\u201d and will \u201cput an end to the debilitating conflicts that even now continue to tear our nation apart\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will do what is necessary to achieve these outcomes because all of us in the House of Representatives recognize that this moment in our history is fraught with promise and peril, and the future of our country lies in our hands,\u201d he said while calling on participants at the public hearing to make meaningful contributions.",

          "title": "Our 6-year records demystified naysayers \u2013 FG",
          "text": "The federal government has said its performance in all sectors of development in the last six years has shamed critics of the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and demystified the naysayers on the resolve to take Nigeria to the next level.\n\nReeling out the mid-term report of the All Progressives Congress(APC)-led government at a press conference in Abuja Tuesday, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the naysayers decided to close their eyes to the tremendous achievements recorded in the last six years.\n\nThe minister said, to prove to Nigerians the administration had taken the country from Change when it took over power in 2015 to the Next Level which it promised the people, government has decided to release a documentary through video footages of the various efforts to make life conducive for everyone.\n\nThe new strategy\n\nHe said government decided to mark this year\u2019s anniversary in a new style and strategy with a view to availing Nigerians quality information about the modest efforts in making life meaningful for the citizenry.\n\n\u201cTo mark this anniversary, we have decided to, once again, change our strategy. Since 2016, we have heralded every anniversary, as well as every end of year, by giving massive publicity to the achievements of the Administration. We have leveraged our Town Hall Meetings, 18 of which we have held up to day, to showcase the achievements. We have also undertaken media tours of federal government projects covering many sectors across the country.\n\n\u201cIn the run up to the 2019 general elections, we introduced a novel idea when we launched our \u2018Testimony Series\u2019, under which we showcased the Administration\u2019s achievements from the perspective and prism of Nigerians who have benefitted from the various government projects and programmes, ranging from infrastructure to school feeding system. The \u2018Testimony Series\u2019 was so successful that it rattled the opposition into issuing a statement calling for a probe of the funds spent on it.\n\n\u201cThis year, 2021, which marks the half-way point of the second and final term of the Muhammadu Buhari Administration, we have decided to once again change our style for more effectiveness. Our new strategy is to suffuse the airwaves and the social media with unmistakable video evidence of the various achievements, to such an extent that even the blind can \u2018see\u2019 and the deaf can \u2018hear\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe documentary, which will be updated from time to time until the end of the Administration\u2019s tenure, covers roads, rail, housing, power, aviation, agriculture, ports, bridges, health, fight against Covid-19, water resources and the economy generally.\n\n\u201cLet me repeat what I have said many times in the past: Never in the history of our country has any Administration done so much with so little. It\u2019s easy to forget now, but when this Administration came into office in 2015, the price of crude oil, which provides 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s budgetary revenues and 95 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, dropped drastically and, along with it, the fund available to the government. It is therefore monumental that this Administration has achieved so much despite the paucity of fund,\u201d the minister said.\n\nOn some of the projects\n\nHe listed some of the projects undertaken by the present administration, noting that while work had been completed on many of the projects, work was still ongoing on others. The projects include roads and railways infrastructure, security, agriculture, ports among others.\n\nMohammed said the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail is nearing completion; 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began; while the Abuja Light Rail was completed in 2018.\n\nHe said ground-breaking was done for the construction of the Kano-Maradi Standard Gauge Rail; revamping of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Narrow Gauge Rail; while financing negotiation is ongoing for Ibadan-Kano Standard Gauge Rail project.\n\nOn road infrastructure, the minister said Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) \u201cis investing over a billion dollars in three flagship projects; Lagos -Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\nHe said the \u201cExecutive Order 7 was explored in mobilising private investment into the development of key roads and bridges like Bodo-Bonny in Rivers and Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota in Lagos, while the Highway Development and Management Initiative (HDMI), a public-private partnership programme was entered into to mobilise, in its first Phase, over a Trillion Naira in private investment into the development and maintenance of 12 Roads, amounting to 1,963km in length while more than N360 billion worth of Sukuk Bonds raised since 2017 for dozens of critical road projects across all six geopolitical zones.\u201d\n\nSecurity\n\nSpeaking on insecurity, Lai said: \u201cI want to state emphatically that while more attention has been given, especially in recent times, to the security challenges facing our country; those challenges are fleeting and will not define the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cLet me say that President Buhari\u2019s legacy is assured, and will be defined by his massive achievements in office. The roads, rails, bridges, mass housing, port development, improvement in power supply and other massive infrastructural development will last for generations to come and will help propel economic growth and national development.\u201d\n\nHe said the Air Force had acquired 26 brand new aircraft since President Buhari assumed office in 2015, and expecting another 12 (the twelve Super Tucano currently on order from the United States Government, due for delivery starting July 2021).\n\nThe NAF is also locally re-activating several previously unserviceable planes, the minister added.\n\nSimilarly, he said: \u201cThe Nigerian Navy has acquired close to 400 new platforms since 2015, including 172 Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs), 114 Rigid-Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIBs), 2 Seaward Defence Boats (SDBs), 12 Manta Class/Inshore Patrol Craft (IPC), 3 Whaler Boats, 4 Barges / Tug Boats, 22 Fast Attack Boats, 14 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), 4 Helicopters, 14 River Town Class, 14 House Boats and 4 Capital Ships.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn line with the president\u2019s directive, the Nigerian Navy has established a Naval Base Lake Chad in Baga, Borno state, as well as deployed 14 Naval Security Stations along the nation\u2019s coastline in areas prone to criminal activity.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari signed into law, in 2019, the Bill establishing the Police Trust Fund, which will significantly improve funding for the Nigeria Police Force. Nigeria Police Force launched a new National Command and Control Center in Abuja in 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nPorts\n\nThe minister also spoke on the completion of the new terminals for international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt; construction of new runway for Abuja and Enugu International Airports; presidential approval for four International Airports as Special Economic Zones: Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt as well as the approval for new private-sector funded deep sea ports, including the Lekki Deep Sea Port (construction already well underway, for completion in 2022); Bonny Deep Sea Port (ground-breaking done in March 2021); Ibom Deep Sea Port; and the Warri Deep Sea Port.\n\nDevelopment of Eastern Ports\n\nHe further said: \u201cIn December 2017, Calabar Port commenced export of bulk cement to Tema Port in Ghana; in 2019, three container ships berthed at Calabar Port, for the first time in eleven years; dredging of Warri Port (Escravos Bar\u2014Warri Port channel) completed in 2018.\n\n\u201cOn October 30, 2019, an LPG Tanker operated by NLNG, berthed in Port Harcourt \u2013 the first time ever an LPG ship berthed in any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n\u201cOn December 8, 2019, Onne Port received JPO VOLANS (owned by Maersk), the FIRST gearless and largest container vessel (265.07 metres) to call at any Eastern Port in Nigeria. On August 1, 2019, Onne Port\u2019s Brawal Terminal received MSC GRACE, its first container vessel since 2012.\n\nAgriculture\n\nOn agriculture, he said: \u201cThe Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than 300 billion Naira to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soy Beans, Groundnut, Fish), cultivating over 3.8 million hectares of farmland.\n\n\u201cLaunched as a government-to-government partnership between the Nigerian and Moroccan Governments, in December 2016, the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative (PFI) produced 12million 50kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 equivalent in 2020, bringing total production since inception to over 30 million 50kg bags equivalent; and number of participating blending plants increased to 44 from three at inception.\n\n\u201cA partnership between FGN, AfDB Group, and other stakeholders, including IFAD and BOI. Under the SAPZ programme, agro-processing centres will be established across the country. The agro-processing centres will be provided with basic infrastructure such as water, electricity and roads as well as facilities for skills training. Seven (7) States and the FCT selected for the pilot phase, due to commence 2021: Ogun, Oyo, Imo, Cross River, Kano, Kaduna, Kwara.\n\n\u201cThe Green Imperative \u2013 a Nigeria-Brazil Agricultural Mechanisation Programme aimed at boosting agricultural production in Nigeria. The National Assembly has approved a loan for the financing of the program, which will involve the development of 632 privately-operated primary production (mechanisation) Service Centers and 142 Agro processing (value addition) service Centres across the 774 LGAs, and the reactivation of 6 privately owned partially-operational or moribund tractor assembly plants nationwide. It will also train 100,000 new extension workers,\u201d he further said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Following the report of recent attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen on Odoke, Ndiobasi, and Obakotara communities in Izhi, Ebonyi Local Government Area, an Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in Diaspora (AESID) has blamed governor Dave Umahi, for the continued killings in the state.\n\nThe Ebonyi indigenes said the recent attack is considered the highest number casualties in the South-east region in recent times, \u201cnatives of the three affected communities were slaughtered in their scores with many dead and several others critically injured.\u201d\n\nIn a statement made available to newsmen Tuesday in Abuja by the association\u2019s President Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, expressed disappointment that \u201cdespite earlier signs and premeditations including an alleged audio voice note widely circulated on the Social media which alerted on the plan to launch a fresh offensive on our defenseless citizens, the Ebonyi state government took no action to protect and defend the victims of this recent onslaught.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly pained that helpless and hapless women, children and youths were cut in their prime in a dastard carnage that spanned for some hours while their victims were deep in their sleep.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, medical and health-care workers in various parts of the State are offering treatments to scores of victims who sustained varying degrees of injuries during the attack. They have also been calls for ebullient citizens to provide clothing and other essential materials to the victims many of who are stranded in the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, AE-FUTHA, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cOur anxiety over this sadly depressing attacks is made worse by the fact that the State\u2019s Chief Security Officer, Engr. David Umahi on whose shoulders hugely lie the constitutional burden of protection of lives and properties of our beloved citizens has largely down-played all sensible and reasonable warnings about the activities of killer herdsmen.\n\nWhile condemning the massacre in Ebonyi communities, the group decried and questioned the conducts and activities of the men operating under the EbubeAgu Security network, saying \u201cthe outfit has remained what we had feared- a deliberate, willful and willing tool in the hands of the state government to hunt down, hound and maim members of the opposition- PDP and other voices.\n\n\u201cRather than seek practical and viable solutions that can quell the growing unrests and attacks on our people, AESID wishes to reiterate that Umahi is so deeply stuck in his 2023 politics that he is rather empowering and emboldening the \u2018bad guys\u2019 to attack and kill those he considers his opponents.\n\n\u201cThis group consequently condemn the claim that the attack took place in Benue State and the attempt by the State government to further downplay or trivialize not only the latest attack on Izhi communities but the entire security affairs in our dear State. The silence of the Speaker and political class in Izhi land, nay Ebonyi State and their inability to condemn these attack including the desperation of Umahi and his cahoots in security circles to always exonerate the provocative Fulani herdsmen from blames where and whenever they occur in Ebonyi demands thorough probe by International security bodies.\u201d\n\nAESID however, called on the state government to change tactics in addressing insecurity in Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cUnless perhaps he changes style and strategy on his current grandstanding and unbridled politicization of the security of lives and property of our people, AESID will continue to dump the blames of the killings of our people by marauding herders on the doorsteps of the Governor just as he continues to pay more attention and interest to his shadow-chasing 2023 political projections and campaigns!\u201d",

All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\u201d\n\nWhile recalling that hat he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 general elections, Buhari said: \u201cMajority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: No Third Term Agenda, Elections Will Hold \u2013 Buhari\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with constitutional provisions, adding that those misbehaving in certain parts of the country were obviously too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nHe added, \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nThe President said the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, President Buhari said he would give the electoral commission all it needed to operate, \u201cso that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the INEC Chairman said that so far, there have been 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide, since the last General Election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the Federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections.\n\n\u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections.

It did not include any limits on the President\u2019s term of office and allowed for citizens to be denied the right to vote for failure to pay the \u2018poll tax\u2019. Twenty-seven reviews and amendments, over one hundred years cured these and other defects.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons.

The membership of the Assembly should be part-time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee and, more importantly, people they claim to serve,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped. The House of Representatives too should not be unwieldy. A maximum of four representatives should come from each zone.\u201d\n\nAccording the Governor, \u201cthe position of the Ondo State Government has been made public. We advocate for a Federal Government largely reduced in size and scope of engagement.

          "text": "Trent Alexander-Arnold, Reece James, Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker have all been included in Gareth Southgate\u2019s 26-man England squad for the upcoming European Championships.\n\nMason Greenwood, Ben Godfrey, Jesse Lingard, Aaron Ramsdale, James Ward-Prowse, Ollie Watkins, Ben White have all missed out on the final list having originally made the 33-man provisional squad named by Southgate last week.\n\nAn underlying problem saw Greenwood ruled out of the Euros earlier on Tuesday, while despite injury concerns for Jordan Henderson, Harry Maguire and Kalvin Phillips, the trio have all made the final squad.\n\n\u201cThe most complex part this time has been those injuries, whether we should take the chance on people,\u201d Southgate said after the announcement.\n\n\u201cIn Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire we\u2019ve got a couple of players who are not where they\u2019d be ideally in terms of their physical preparation, but we think the experience they have and the fact we think we can get them to a point where they can have an involvement in the tournament, it\u2019s worth taking them. Especially as we\u2019ve got an extended squad of 26.\u201d\n\nThe inclusion of four right-backs in the provisional 33-man squad last week had led to seven days of speculation regarding which player or players might miss out.\n\nSouthgate had highlighted the quartet\u2019s versatility last week when stating \u201cI see good footballers\u201d, suggesting Alexander-Arnold could play in midfield, with James, Trippier and Walker capable of playing in various defensive roles.\n\nAs a result, all four players have made the final list which features 10 defenders and just five midfielders, including 17-year-old Jude Bellingham.\n\nBukayo Saka and Jack Grealish are among the eight forwards in the squad, with the latter set to wear the No.7 shirt at the tournament.\n\nEngland play Austria in a warm-up fixture on Wednesday at the Riverside, and then host Romania at Middlesbrough\u2019s stadium on Sunday \u2013 a week before their Euros campaign begins against Croatia at Wembley on June 13.\n\nScotland will be England\u2019s second Group D opponents on June 18, followed by Czech Republic on June 22. The winner of the group will face the runners-up from Group F, which features France, Germany, Hungary and Portugal.\n\nSouthgate added: \u201cWe\u2019re not taking any tourists here. We\u2019ve got a squad, all of whom are ready to play and contribute. That\u2019s really important because over the next nine matches we hope to be involved in, we\u2019re going to need everybody.\n\n\u201cThe most difficult thing is that when we get to the first game we can only pick a squad of 23 on matchday, it\u2019s hard enough to pick 11. Potentially we could be disappointing people on those matchdays, although we might not have everybody available.\n\n\u201cThe pros are that we\u2019ve been able to take a chance on players that we may have had to rule out. We have been able to cover ourselves in different positions, different tactical formations. [With] the professionalism of the group and the respect the group have for each other, I don\u2019t think the 26 is as big an issue as it might have been.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s 26-man squad for Euro 2020:\n\nGoalkeepers: Dean Henderson (Manchester United), Sam Johnstone (West Brom), Jordan Pickford (Everton).\n\nDefenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool), Ben Chilwell (Chelsea), Conor Coady (Wolves), Reece James (Chelsea), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Luke Shaw (Manchester United), John Stones (Manchester City), Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid), Kyle Walker (Manchester City).\n\nMidfielders: Jude Bellingham (Borussia Dortmund), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Mason Mount (Chelsea), Kalvin Phillips (Leeds), Declan Rice (West Ham).\n\nForwards: Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton), Phil Foden (Man City), Jack Grealish (Aston Villa), Harry Kane (Tottenham), Marcus Rashford (Manchester United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal), Jadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund), Raheem Sterling (Man City).",
