          "title": "2023: Ex Edo revenue Boss, Owie declares for senate",
          "text": "A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former Executive Chairman of Edo State Internal Revenue Service (EIRS), Dr. Ese Owie has formally declared his intention to seek the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party to contest the 2023 Senatorial Election to represent Edo South in the Senate.\n\nSpeaking in Benin yesterday at a well attended consultative session hosted by the State Vice-Chairman (Edo South) of the PDP in Edo State, and Members of the Senatorial Working Committee, Dr. Owie stated that he is the most competent and most prepared of all the aspirants seeking to clinch the Senatorial ticket of the Party in the forthcoming elections.\n\nAt the occasion which also had in attendance, prominent leaders of the Party in the State, Chairmen of the PDP in all the 7 LGAs in Edo South and Members of their respective Executives, Ward Chairmen, Secretaries, Women Leaders and Youth Leaders from across Edo South, Dr. Owie succinctly highlighted his career trajectory, impeccable pedigree, and accomplishments, arguing that all things considered, he stands heads and shoulders above everyone else in the fray. The audience warmly received Dr. Owie\u2019s message with cheers and admiration.\n\n\u201cI am an accomplished Practitioner in International Trade Law, Trade Policy, and Trade Economics. In the course of my sterling multi-jurisdictional career spanning over two decades, I have garnered extensive experience in advising National Governments, Multilateral Agencies and Private Organizations on International Trade Law and International Economic Law & Policy with special focus on Sustainable Trade and Regional Economic Integration, amongst others\u201d, he stated.\n\n\u201cBetween 2009 and 2011, I served as Special Adviser (Cabinet Rank) to the Executive Governor of Edo State on Policy and Strategic Planning and helped to shape the Administration\u2019s strategic policy direction. I subsequently had the privilege of serving as Executive Chairman of Edo State Board of Internal Revenue and a Member of the State Executive Council, where I functioned as the Administrative Head of the State\u2019s Internal Revenue Service.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the Board of Internal Revenue, I led a transformation of the State\u2019s Internally Generated Revenue institutional framework and grew the monthly revenue from approximately 250 million Naira per month to over 1.8 Billion Naira monthly within one year \u2013 a feat that has remained unsurpassed in any National or Sub-National Taxation or Revenue Generation Agency in Africa, South of the Sahara.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the glory of the Almighty, I have successfully reformed what had been, over the years, considered the most opaque government agency in any jurisdiction, and recorded success that has remained un-matched. I am, thus, of the firm belief, that when elected the Senator representing Edo South, I will effectively mainstream the interests of Edo South into the conceptualization and implementation of the overall national development plans.\u201d\n\nEruditely explaining the role of a Legislator in national development, Dr. Owie stated that \u201cin line with global best practices, a Legislator essentially has three major functions. The first, which flows from the nature of his job, is the role of making laws, and indeed, this is why Legislators are called lawmakers. A Legislator\u2019s first and primary responsibility is, thus, to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of the country.\n\n\u201cThat constitutional responsibility also places a heavy onus on the Legislator to make laws that will be beneficial to his/her constituents. In order to achieve this objective, a Legislator must, through persuasion and negotiation, collaborate with his or her colleagues in mainstreaming the interests of his/her local constituency within the context of national developmental imperatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cA second function, which is no less important, is the Legislator\u2019s duty in scrutinizing the Executive\u2019s Appropriation Bill, a process colloquially referenced as \u201cputting together the budget\u201d of the country. It is during this appropriation process that the versatile Legislator persuades, negotiates and collaborates with his colleagues as well as the Executive branch to attract essential federal projects and services that would engender physical development and economic empowerment of his/her constituency and constituents, respectively.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third, and by far the most impactful, is the Legislative oversight upon Executive decisions and project execution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin the context of a prosperous Edo South, and a sustainable future for Edo State, our Legislative Agenda shall focus on 5 Thematic Pillars that would positively and fundamentally alter the developmental landscape of the Senatorial District\u201d , Dr Owie stated.\n\n\u201cThe thematic pillars are Education, Healthcare, Infrastructure, Agriculture and Wealth Creation\u201d he added.\n\nIn terms of Education, Dr. Owie plans to revamp the University of Benin to adequately compete with other Universities on the Continet, while the Elaiho Grammar School, Eguaholor, will be converted to a Federal University of Agriculture via a private member Bill, among other initiatives.\n\nIn the Health sector, Dr. Owie gave assurances that he would ensure that the Federal Ministry of Health undertakes a comprehensive upgrade of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, which is the 2nd largest Tertiary Healthcare Facility in Africa (circa 1,100 Beds), to international standards so as to optimise access to healthcare in Edo and neighbouring states. Optimizing the operations of the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Uselu, to meet the mental health needs of our people would also be a priority.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, the\n\ncompletion of Phase 2 of the Benin Outer Road (the By-Pass) would be a priority, same as the completion of the Benin-Ekpoma-Auchi-Lokoja-Abuja Road. (To be done in conjunction with Senators from Edo Central and North).\n\nDr. Owie also promised to assiduously pursue the upgrading of the Benin Airport to a full fledged International Airport\n\nIn the areas of Flood and Erosion Control, he promised to ensure the commencement of the 2nd Phase of the Abudu Erosion Control Project and the 3rd Phase of the Urhonigbe Erosion Control Project\n\nIn the area of power he promised to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Power to see to the speedy completion of the Uhunmwode Electricity Project and the electrification of selected Rural Communities in all the 7 LGAs.\n\nIn Agriculture, Dr. Owie assured the Party Leaders that aggressively pursue the optimization of the operations of Rubber Research Institute Iyanomo, National Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) and Benin Owena River Basin Development Authority to ensure that Edo South maximises its comparative advantage in Agriculture.\n\nIn the area of wealth creation, Dr. Owie promised to reverse the current tokenistic approach to \u2019empowerment\u2019 schemes by raising the awareness of the constituents on the available federal government state-aid and support schemes (Bank of Industry, Bank of Agriculture, SMEDAN, etc); and assist the constituents to access these aids through training/orientation, and by reduction of the bureaucratic bottlenecks.\n\nConcluding, Dr. Owie assured the statutory delegates that by virtue of the Electoral Act 2022 (as Amended) the Primaries would be concluded by June 2022; the plan is to engage with the relevant committees of the National Assembly with a view to making adequate provisions for the proposed projects in the 2023 Appropriation Bill, such that we can hit the ground running upon election and assumption of office in May 2023\u2033.\n\nPresent at the occasion are the Deputy State Chairman PDP, Mr Harrison Omagbon, State Vice Chairman (Edo South) Barr Nosa Ogieva, Senatorial Leader, Etose Dickson Imasogie, State Legal Adviser, Barr Arthur Esene, Barr Oni Edigin, State Woman Leader, Mrs. Lindsay Sorae, Senatorial Woman Leader (Edo South) Mrs. West-Irabor, Martin Osakue, all the 7 LGA PDP Chairmen of Edo South, Women Leaders from the 7 LGAs, Youth Leaders, Ward Chairmen, and other dignitaries.",

          "text": "\u2026Zulum says Nigeria\u2019s foreign policies is deficit of national passion\n\nBy Ezra Ukanwa, Abuja\n\nThe Chief of Staff, CoS, to President Mohammadu Buhari, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, has said that the Foreign Policy of the Nigerian state does not showcase Nigeria\u2019s worldview, national interests, and values.\n\nGambari noted this while speaking in Abuja at the public presentation of a book entitled, \u2018with Heart and Might\u2019 written by Ambassador Mohammed Kawu Ibrahim.\n\nDignitaries at the launch include Governor of Borno state, professor Babagana Zulum; the Emir of Kano state, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero; among, Chief of Staff to the President Ibrahim Gambari, and others.\n\nAccording to Gambari, the task of foreign policy is the task of furthering the absolute necessity of promoting; defending; and advancing the clearly articulated national interest values and goals of a country and as that country interacts with or assists or assists in the international system.\n\nHe went further to explain that the book, which he claimed aptness, addressed some of the lapses of Nigeria\u2019s foreign policies and how it has affected Nigeria\u2019s domestic politics and policy.\n\nGambari said: \u201cthere is a direct relationship between domestic politics and the conduct of a country\u2019s external relations because you see, you can give abroad what you don\u2019t have at home and that is why this links between domestic politics, policy and the conduct of external relations are very important.\n\n\u201cTherefore the task of foreign policy is the task of furthering the absolute necessity to promote, defend, advance the clearly articulated national interest values and goals of a country and as that country interacts with or states in the international system in this memoir, M.K Ibrahim, reasserted the fundamental linkage between the domestic and external politics which shape the external policies of the state based on shared benefits. In this memoir, M.K Ibrahim, reasserted the fundamental linkage between the domestic and external politics which shape the external policies of the state based on shared benefits.\n\n\u201cForeign policy is not about \u201cdogo turenchi\u201d which is reserved for the kind of elite that is assembled in this, it is more that. It is an external projection of the values that we have as a nation. It is also the promotion of our national interest and our worldview because other countries want to know where we stand on issues, that\u2019s why not just input in the general assembly of the UN or the ECOWAS or even in the African Union, but generally articulated at home, where do we stand?\n\n\u201cWhat do we value? What are our priorities as a nation? What are the national interests that we wish to defend? Therefore, in my view, we need to continue to struggle to build a national consensus behind the articulation, design and defense of our national interest in the new millennium, which is based on the promotion of peace and security, sustainable development, as well as the development and democratization at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, Nigeria must continue to establish both in principle and practice the approach that it is no longer enough to seek what your country can do for others, but what we can do together with others in the pursuit of our common interests. And it is our duty and diplomacy to persuade others that is in their own interest to try to support us what we propose, promote as a national interest and if you don\u2019t agree with this, just look at what Israel has managed to do with the United States they have made their interest, the interest of the United States.\n\n\u201cin the articulation and promotion because you\u2019re adding to your power, you\u2019re adding to your identity of prestige when other countries adopt as their interest, what you define as your interest. And it\u2019s very important to know and that\u2019s the skill of diplomacy. And that\u2019s where you have to recruit the best and the brightest, you know, to not only define your interest but to get other people to define their interest in your own interests, and that is one of the successes of any country\u2019s diplomacy. So as I said, the principle and practice of bodies shared responsibility to govern even those external endeavors which are in our own interest. And that is why in this context, building African institutions like the Lake Chad Basin Commission, like the ECOWAS, the African Union, African Development Bank, African Export Import Bank, has become a distinct feature of the Buhari administration\u2019s foreign policy and our country\u2019s diplomacy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the term concentric circles because somebody unknown has been associated with that concept, but whether in theory and practice, you will find that you have to begin at home and then widen do your circle of interest and effectiveness around your neighbor then you review, then your continent then association such as a commonwealth, such as non aligned movement G77, but the court must always be at home, the defense and pursuit of our national interests based on promotion of peace and security, economic prosperity of our people, and the values that we share in terms of democratization and human rights.\u201d\n\nMEANWHILE, the Governor of Borno state, Professor Babagana Zulum who was represented by his chief of staff, Professor ISA Marte, pointed that for the first three decades of Nigeria\u2019s independence, apart from the protection of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, there was no foreign policy issue that Nigeria had pursued with unrelenting commitment as the fight against colonialism in Africa and ending Apartheid in South Africa.\n\nHe stated further that one of the issues bedeviling the foreign policy of the country is that these foreign policies lacked national passion and commitment.\n\n\u201cAll great nations have clearly defined foreign policies, which entail the defense of the territorial integrity of the nation and the protection of the interests of her citizens both within and outside the country. For the first three decades of her independence, apart from the protection of Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, there was no foreign policy issue that Nigeria had pursued with unrelenting commitment as the fight against colonialism in Africa and ending Apartheid in South Africa.\n\n\u201cSince successfully bringing these inhuman vices against Africa and the Blackman to an end, Nigeria has not taken up any foreign policy foray with the same national passion and commitment. This continues to be one of the major challenges of our foreign policy\u201d, he bemoaned.\n\nOn his part, the Emir of Kano state, Alhaji Bayero Ado, commended the effort of Amb. Ibrahim in his new book, stating that it has raised the stakes for anyone having the ambition to write a similar book particularly from the Foreign Service family.\n\nHe further urge all Foreign Service Officers to emulate Amb. Ibrahim by putting pen to paper to document for posterity the rich and the invaluable experiences they garnered and the sacrifices they made over the years from the different countries they have served during their postings around the globe.\n\nAlso speaking during the event, Amb Ibrahim expressed gratitude to all the dignitaries that graced the occasion, stating that he will continue to exert efforts in ensuring that Nigeria gains its ground in the international community.",

Because these structures are places where these products are stored that always results in fire outbreaks\u201d.\n\nReacting to the incident, the state Commissioner for Special Duties, Emeka Onowu, said the fire was caused by the activities of persons living in the shanties.\n\nRead Also: Mystery midnight fire wipes out family of seven\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to victimize anyone. But I think enough is enough. Nobody should try to blackmail anybody.\n\n\u201cJust look at the fire incident going on here. It will tell you that something is fishy. Look at the shanties everywhere.\n\n\u201cIf government comes to demolish it, people will start saying the governor is a wicked man. This is a tank farm and explosion came.\n\n\u201cWhere you have a tank farm, do you expect people to be cooking or lighting fire around that area? These are the causes of this fire because either they are using gas, firewood or light.\n\n\u201cBut fire also is a natural disaster, so you cannot blame anybody. But this one is not a natural disaster. We are trying to handle it by the grace of God.\n\nHe commended youths in the area for assisting security agencies and firefighters to put out the inferno.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that it is happening here.

Eric Ogbo Asogwa, Mazi Chinedu Mba and others to leave IPOB alone.\n\nIn a statement by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, IPOB also dissociated itself from the viral videos on social media on purported fund raising for its Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nIt noted that the said fundraiser had no approval of its Directorate of State (DOS), urging the public to disregard such move.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the laughable and fallacious statement from those unfortunate self-acclaimed disciples in Europe and Umuada highways in America who were sponsored by unfortunate politicians in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey claim that they were asked to raise funds for ESN but that\u2019s not true. We, therefore, dissociate with the viral videos on Facebook and YouTube platforms for purported fundraise for ESN. The said fundraise does not have the approval of the Directorate of State (DOS) of IPOB.\n\n\u201cThose behind the questionable project are working in cohorts with certain politicians in the country with the intent to use same to execute their 2023 political ambition. Our people should not fall for their trap. Their intent is to drag our hallowed name into their dirty politics. The public should beware of such saboteurs.\n\n\u201cWe want to say it categorically that those sponsored to use the name of IPOB to do politics in Enugu State and elsewhere are not IPOB members and we also warn those behind and sponsors of this falsehood, Senator Ike Ekweremadu to stop his campaign DG Engineer Eric Ogbo Asogwa, Mazi Chinedu Mba and others to leave IPOB alone and should not drag IPOB into their dirty politics, if they continue they will regret their actions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also important to clarify that IPOB has never made any statement concerning the government of Enugu State and its election. Any purported statement attributed to IPOB concerning Enugu State government and its election in 2023 is fake and should be disregarded. IPOB is after Biafra restoration and not concerned with elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge members of the public to disregard the said viral videos purportedly claiming it\u2019s coming from IPOB office, no it wasn\u2019t from IPOB and about the dubious fundraise and Enugu State election.\n\n\u201cWe knew they are sponsoring the destruction of IPOB but they will fail. IPOB has nothing to do with them such ridiculous statement concerning Enugu State government.\n\n\u201cWe also warn those behind these devilish activities to be careful and leave IPOB out of their dirty politics. They should leave IPOB alone and face their hopeless politics in Nigeria because IPOB is not interested in their evil politics. Any further use of IPOB\u2019s name for political reasons in any part of Biafra land will attract severe sanctions.\n\n\u201cOur major preoccupation now is the unconditional release of our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and date for Biafra referendum, not Nigeria politics not so Nigeria will never have peace.\u201d",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo has warned retiring soldiers of the Nigerian Armed Forces to be wary of subversive element within the society, urging them to stay away from these elements and remain loyal to the Nigerian military.\n\nAdmiral Gambo spoke at the passing out of 329 military personnel from the Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC) in Lagos urging the soldiers to also remain loyal to the Federal Republic of Nigeria, especially as the insecurity within country has taken a new dimension.\n\nHe warned the retiring trainees of the centre to beware of the challenges common with post service year, adding that the level of insecurity within the country has taken a new dimension hence they must be wary of subversive elements within the environment and avoid associating with them.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\n\nGambo was the Special Guest of Honour during the passing out ceremony of the NAFRC Course 1/2022 Stream one, where 258 Nigerian Army personnel, 59 Nigerian Navy and 12 Nigerian Air Force graduated from the course.\n\nHis words: \u201cSo many challenges are associated with post service life which include how you manage your resources especially your retirement benefits among others.\n\n\u201cAlso, influence from members of your family and friends, management of your physical and mental health as well as integrating with the civil society must be properly managed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I urge you to be proactive in your conduct in order to overcome these challenges because your loyalty to the Armed Forces of Nigeria and the Federal Republic is non- negotiable.\u201d\n\nGambo said that it was also risky for them to embark on a new lifestyle that was above their means or engage in non lucrative ventures, neither should they abstain from physical exercises.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe society will expect high moral standards and discipline from you and you will have to prove that you passed through a highly disciplined system.\n\n\u201cI am sure that your training exposed you to several vocational opportunities and general management skills to alleviate above mentioned pitfalls inorder to have a stress-free and meaningful life in retirement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CNS said that the trainee pre-retirement course was designed to reorientate and position them for a successful reintegration into civil life after a commendable service.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that after your graduation, the services at this centre will continue to get positive feedback as you gallantly serve through post service life.\n\n\u201cYou will from now on take full charge as planners and executors of your personal daily activities.\n\n\u201cThis may sound exciting and promising but beware, you will need to properly manage your freedom and make good use of your resources inorder to be successful,\u201d he said.\n\nGambo noted that the graduands were still beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Scheme programme.\n\n\u201cI therefore, adviced you to do the necessary documentation to enable you access post retirement medical care without deduction from your retirement benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CNS urged the graduands to justify the magnanimity of President Muhammadu Buhari who had continued to support the armed forces especially retiring personnel as observed in the enhanced welfare packages.\n\nGambo also commended the leadership of the NAFRC under Air Vice Marshal Idi Lubo for it\u2019s effort at ensuring that discharging trainees are exposed to master trends in global entrepreneurship and management frame.\n\n\u201cYour reviewed curriculum has enabled personnel to benefit from the modern trend of doing business.\n\n\u201cI urge the Commandant to continue this laudable initiative for high quality human resource development so that the high standard for which the centre is known for is sustained,\u201d the CNS said.\n\nAlso speaking, Lubo said that over 50,000 personnel of the armed forces had been trained in NAFRC since it\u2019s inception in the 1980\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe centre has also successfully trained members of paramilitary agencies as well as members from federal ministries, departments and agencies.\n\n\u201cThe training the centre provides help beneficiaries to be equiped with skills for self sustenance and meaningful income while approaching life with a positive mindset.\n\n\u201cThis will enable them contribute meaningfully to their various societies thus reducing crime, criminality as well as other vices from our society,\u201d he said.\n\nAVM Lubo

She was happy that she acted swiftly and saved herself the public opprobrium that would have followed her attack.\n\nShe narrated her ordeal thus: \u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent. She then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival. Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voiced raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrain from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head-tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThe former APGA Chairman, Umeh, told her to leave me and told engaged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband, Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an inauguration ceremony that began at 9am?\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony. This was highly embarrassing to the former governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\n\u201cLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\n\n\u201cIt is rather unfortunate that the former First Lady of Anambra State chose a high state function such as the inauguration ceremony of the incoming governor of Anambra State, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, who had personally invited me to the ceremony, not only in my capacity as a major stakeholder in Anambra State, but also as a principal member of the Board of Trustees of APGA, to display such crass aggression.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that she is engaging in such outrageous behaviour. What is unfortunate is that by her conduct, she deeply embarrassed not only her immediate family and the peace-loving people of Anambra State, but she has equally displayed utter disregard for the office of Governor, which her own husband was respectfully allowed to enjoy in peace and dignity.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*Buni, secretary at party\u2019s HQ, continue \u2018preparations along line of scheduled activities\u2019\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Bello Kawu of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), sitting at Kubwa, yesterday vacated an order of his court restraining the All Progressives Congress (APC), from going ahead with its planned National Convention, pending the hearing and determination of a suit against its conduct.\n\n\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC, Mai Mala Buni, met with his supposedly sacked Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, at the party\u2019s secretariat, thus dispelling the rumour that the latter had been removed.\n\nJustice Kawu vacated the order stalling APC\u2019s National Convention following an application by the party to that effect.\n\n\n\nAn aggrieved member of the APC, Salisu Umoru, had approached the court for an exparte order of injunction to temporarily restrain the defendants, which included the APC; Chairman of CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni; and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting the planned convention slated for March 26, 2021.\n\n\n\nJustice Kawu, having found the application meritorious on November 18, 2021 granted the other.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied and desirous of working in accordance with the timetable of INEC, the APC early in March, this year, approached the court to set aside the said order so as to pave a way for the conduct of the scheduled convention.\n\n\n\nDelivering ruling in the application as moved by Shuaib Aruwan, SAN, Justice Bello Kawu, held that the Plaintiff lacked the locus to sustain the restraining order.\n\nAccording to the judge, the order of injunction issued against the APC on November 18, 2021, had been overtaken by a recent judgment the Supreme Court delivered on a similar matter.\n\n\n\nHe subsequently vacated the order and adjourned the Plaintiff\u2019s substantive suit till March 30 for hearing.\n\nJustice Kawu had on November 18, 2021, while ruling in an exparte application, halted the APC convention to enable him reach a decision in the originating summons by Honourable Salisu Umoru challenging the planned convention.\n\n\n\nIn the case with suit number FCT/HC/CV/2958/2021 and motion number FCT/HC/M/9655/21, the plaintiff prayed the court for an Order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants and their agents from organising, holding or conducting the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress in January and February or at any other date either before or after, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe Plaintiff had, among other things, prayed the court to direct the APC and its CECPC Chairman, to halt further action on the planned convention, pending the resolution of legal cases involving the party.\n\n\n\nHe equally sought an order directing Buni to begin the reconciliation process to resolve all the disputes that emanated from the local government congresses that were conducted by the party.\n\nIn granting the request last November, the judge warned that the subject matter of the case was now subjudice and must not be tampered with.\n\nAkpanudoedehe Remains Secretary\n\n\n\nBuni met with Akpanudoedehe yesterday at the party\u2019s secretariat, thus dispelling the rumour that the latter had been sacked.\n\nAides of Buni pushed out photographs from the meeting and unofficially confirmed that Akpanudoedehe had resumed as secretary and that the two men met \u201cto continue preparations along the line of scheduled activities.\u201d\n\n\n\nA source at the meeting added: \u201cContrary to reports claiming that CECPC had removed its secretary, the leadership of the party has declared that his office remains intact. In line with President Buhari\u2019s directive that things should go back to status quo, Akpanudoedehe remains the Secretary.\n\n\n\nIn an interview yesterday, Akpanudoedehe also confirmed that he remains the party\u2019s secretary, noting that President Buhari\u2019s directive that status quo ante be maintained, solidified that position.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cOur Chairman (Buni) cannot go against the instruction of the President. In his last letter, the President has given the directive that the status quo ante should remain. The Chairman is a very brilliant man, he respects the President and will not go against that.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am the National Secretary of APC and the Constitution is very clear on that. The INEC has said for you to sack any of us, you need 21 days\u2019 notice. I want to also thank the APC for giving content to the media houses to sell their papers. We have promoted your economy in the last month.\n\n\n\n\u201cI should be celebrated for standing with the Chairman. We should celebrate loyalty, integrity. You can only celebrate good. Why would I be punished for standing with the chairman? It is a virtue. So, nothing has changed in APC. I remain the National Secretary and reconciliation efforts are ongoing. It is one party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Buni-led APC caretaker committee has continued efforts at reconciling aggrieved members of the party ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\nReconciliatory efforts, it was gathered, were to ensure that the forthcoming Convention is seamless and that party stakeholders and members are united for a successful outing at the convention and at the general elections.\n\nBuni was said to have started meeting with aggrieved Chieftains of the party across board in this regard.\n\nFor months, there has been internal wrangling in the party over the National Convention.\n\nThere were allegations that Buni had perfected plans to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention in order to remain as Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBuni and John Akpanudoedehe, CECPC\u2019s Secretary, were alleged to have used a third party to obtain the court order temporarily restraining the ruling party from holding its convention until the substantive suit is heard and determined.\n\n\n\nNasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna, on March 9, alleged that Buni\u2019s lawyers colluded with a petitioner to \u201cdestroy\u201d the National Convention.\n\nHe described the said court order as a \u201chidden nuclear weapon\u201d that would have hampered the party\u2019s chances in the 2023 general election.\n\nLast Thursday, Buni, who returned to Abuja, and back to his job as caretaker chair, after the failed coup to remove him, said the party was at the finishing line of its preparations for the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\nHe also thanked his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Bello, for his efforts while he was away.\n\nBuni\u2019s comments came after his return from a medical trip to Dubai and meeting with President Buhari in London over the leadership crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe leaders, who met at the Yobe State Governors\u2019 Lodge in Asokoro, were flanked by members of the caretaker committee except for Akpanudoedehe.\n\n\n\nBuni stated, \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our National Convention, which is at hand. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 National Convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Akpanudoedehe\u2019s absence from the meeting, Buni explained, \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of the CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not a formal meeting that one will ask whether the secretary is here or not. However, he was in the house earlier today.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a separate statement, Buni pledged not to reverse the decisions taken in his absence, especially with regards to the membership of the sub-committees set up to plan the convention.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the APC had released a new list of the sub-committees showing that there had been a minor shake-up.\n\nIn a statement shortly after, however, Buni said he would not be reversing the actions of Bello and asked members of the public to discountenance the new list.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Bianca \u2018stunned by the stench of whisky on Obiano\u2019s wife\u2019s breath\u2019\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nThe Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, Eze Uzu III of Awka, Austin Ndigwe yesterday declared that Ebelechukwu, wife of former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano had desecrated Awka by fighting Bianca, widow of late Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu and that the Gods of the Kingdom must be appeased.\n\nAlso yesterday, Bianca issued a statement about the fight, alleging that Ebelechukwu was drunk when she attacked her.\n\n\n\nA fight that broke out last Thursday between the two women during the inauguration of Professor Charles Soludo as Governor resulted in Bianca slapping Ebelechukwu.\n\nEze Ndigwe also ordered Ebelechukwu to apologise to Bianca within seven days to avoid consequences.\n\nThe Obi of Awka, in his press release, said he had given Ebelechukwu seven days to publicly apologise to the entire Igbo people or face serious consequences.\n\n\n\nHe said the action of the wife of the former governor was sacrilegious, and that as the monarch of the town, he would have to appease the gods of Awka land to avoid calamities.\n\nThe monarch said: \u201cShe should also tender an unreserved apology to the new Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo for her disgraceful conduct during his inauguration. The same should go for the chief judge of the state who was conducting the swearing in when she descended.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis grave sin was committed in the land of Awka which is known for peace and unity. Therefore, as the traditional ruler of the people and chief custodian of our culture, I am under obligation to perform some sacrifices to cleanse our land of this filth and pollution and to appease the gods.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Obi of Awka said he had long spoken to Bianca who told him that what angered her was that Mrs. Obiano walked up to her and called her unprintable names, including querying her presence at the swearing in ceremony.\n\nHe added that a study of the scenario showed that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was deliberate, as she came very much prepared to disrupt the swearing in ceremony.\n\n\n\nNdigwe added that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was not only against Mrs. Ojukwu, but also against the late Ojukwu, who is the founder of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), whom his widow came to represent.\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that Bianca was not at that ceremony as Bianca, but as a direct representative of our late father and leader, Chief Odumegwu-Ojukwu, her late husband who pioneered APGA.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, Ebele\u2019s action of casting aspersions on her is an affront on the entire Igbo people. It was indeed on Odumegwu-Ojukwu and not on Bianca as a person. This is an insult on Igbo and it must not go unpunished.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that I took Obiano and his wife, Ebere to Bianca Ojukwu where they knelt down while seeking the party\u2019s governorship ticket. Bianca endorsed Obiano and called on all APGA members, including then Governor Obi to support him. Mrs. Obiano has only seven days to apologise as demanded and directed or face serious consequences.\u201d\n\nBianca \u2018Stunned By the Stench of Whisky on Obiano\u2019s Wife\u2019s Breath\u2019\n\nBianca issued a statement yesterday, stating that all guests were seated when Ebelechukwu arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the inauguration ceremony was on and that she didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her.\n\n\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain and the Vatican continued: Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language. She asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe held onto her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA chairman, Chief Umeh, told her to leave me and told enraged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode, completely speechless. What struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9am? It is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis was highly embarrassing to the governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him. Luckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Says federal government will immediately give effect to the judgment by gazetting it\n\nEmmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State yesterday nullified the controversial Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 barring political appointees from contesting elections and ordered the Attorney General of the Federation \u201cto delete it forthwith,\u201d saying that it is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.\n\n\n\nBarely few hours after the court\u2019s decision, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami issued a statement saying the federal government \u201cwill immediately give effect to the judgment by gazetting it.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had recently signed the electoral bill into law with a caveat that Section 84(12) be deleted in order to deepen democracy in the country.\n\n\n\nLast week, the Senate surprisingly threw the request of the president out.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed that the federal government would explore other means including the court to ensure the said portion of the law which he claimed offends other sections of the Constitution was expunged from the amended Act.\n\n\n\nDelivering judgment in the matter yesterday, Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court, Umuhia, Abia State, held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThe judge, accordingly, ordered the AGF to forthwith delete Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act.\n\nMalami said his office \u201cwill, accordingly, give effect to the court\u2019s judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the judgment of the Court would be recognised by the government printers in printing the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Umar Gwandu, the AGF said, \u201cThe Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be treated accordingly.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn striking down the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike, held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nRecall that last week, a politician and legal practitioner, Nduka Edede, who is a member of Action Alliance (AA) filed a suit at the Federal High Court Umuahia seeking to nullify the Section 84(12) on the grounds that it was inconsistent with Sections 66,107,137 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the court verdict, counsel to the plaintiff, Emeka Ozoani, SAN, said it had restored the rights of Nigerian citizens which vexatious subsection 12 of Section 84 of the Electoral Act sought to abridge.\n\nAccording to him, the court has now, with this judgment, created \u201ca congenial atmosphere for politicking and political space\u201d ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nHe said there was no need again for the National Assembly to bother with amending Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act as requested by President Buhari as the Court has specifically asked the AGF to delete it since it was an illegal law ab initio.\n\n\n\nCounsel to the AGF, Chris Nevo said that the court judgment was in tandem with the position of the AGF, who has always held that it was wrong to use the Electoral Act to abridge the rights of political appointees to participate in the electoral process.\n\n\n\n\u201cOriginally, we believed that it was a big error on the part of the National Assembly to have inserted the controversial Section 84(12), adding that Nigerians should now heave a sigh of relief as the nation could now face operational issues begging for attention.\u201d\n\n\n\nFalana Punches Holes in Ruling\n\nLagos lawyer and human rights activists, Femi Falana has pointed holes in the judgement of Justice Anyadike, saying that political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service.\n\nFalana argues: With respect, the learned trial judge fell into a great error. Sections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution relied upon by his lordship require persons employed in the public service of either the federal government or state governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically, each of the aforesaid sections provides that \u201cNo person shall be qualified for election into the Senate or House of Reps if: (f) he is a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of any State and has not resigned, withdrawn or retired from such employment 30 days before the date of election.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy virtue of section 318 of the Constitution, political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service. To that extent, section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the Judge would have dismissed the case if his attention had been drawn to the cases of Dada V. Adeyeye (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920) 1 At 19 Asogwa V. Chukwu (2003) 4 NWLR (Pt. 811) 540 Ojonye V. Onu & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate Courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, worked behind the scenes to obtain a court order from Umuahia, Abia State, which ordered the deletion of Section 84 (12) of the Amended Electoral Act, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Malami worked with the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who are all nursing political ambitions ahead of the 2023 general elections, to obtain a court order that would keep them in office even if they join politics.\n\nIt is like having their cake and eating it too.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that the court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State, ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike on Friday held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave the office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nWhile signing the Electoral Bill into law last month, President Buhari had asked the National Assembly to delete section 84 (12), which restricts sitting cabinet members from contesting for elective offices without resigning.\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\nMalami is interested in becoming Kebbi governor; Nwajiuba is being projected by the Project Nigeria Group (PNG) for the presidency; Ngige says he is consulting on running for president; Akpabio has received the backing of the Godswill Akpabio Uncommon Transformational Support Organisation (GAUTSO) to also return to the poll; while the Southern Mandate Group and Chibuike Amaechi Crusaders 2023 want the transportation minister to succeed Buhari.\n\nHowever, top sources revealed to SaharaReporters on Friday night that Malami was the brains behind the court order obtained from Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General is behind the court ruling in Abia State. He received funds from Amaechi and CBN governor to fund the litigation and find the judge to do so as Abuja Federal Court judges refused to touch the case,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF (Malami) was being asked to resign as of last week. He, Amaechi and CBN governor were scared,\u201d another source revealed.\n\nMeanwhile on Friday, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, in the AGF office said the AGF would give effect to the purported judgment without delay.\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Malami had said following the Senate\u2019s refusal, the Nigerian government would consider all other options available to it before a position would be taken.\n\nIt is clear one of the options Malami and others found was a judge to do their bidding.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Attorney-General Malami, Amaechi, Emefiele Procured Court Order Deleting Section 84(12) Of Electoral Act, To Safeguard Their Political Ambitions",
          "text": "The Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, worked behind the scenes to obtain a court order from Umuahia, Abia State, which ordered the deletion of Section 84 (12) of the Amended Electoral Act, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Malami worked with the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who are all nursing political ambitions ahead of the 2023 general elections, to obtain a court order that would keep them in office even if they join politics.\n\nIt is like having their cake and eating it too.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that the court sitting in Umuahia, Abia State, ordered the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the Amended New Electoral Act.\n\nThe court in a judgment delivered by Justice Evelyn Anyadike on Friday held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand as it violates the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nIn the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave the office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nWhile signing the Electoral Bill into law last month, President Buhari had asked the National Assembly to delete section 84 (12), which restricts sitting cabinet members from contesting for elective offices without resigning.\n\nFor instance, with the provisions of the act, political appointees such as Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Malami, Minister of Justice; Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs; Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, among others who have been reportedly linked to presidential and governorship ambitions must resign from their various offices if they want to contest in 2023.\n\nMalami is interested in becoming Kebbi governor; Nwajiuba is being projected by the Project Nigeria Group (PNG) for the presidency; Ngige says he is consulting on running for president; Akpabio has received the backing of the Godswill Akpabio Uncommon Transformational Support Organisation (GAUTSO) to also return to the poll; while the Southern Mandate Group and Chibuike Amaechi Crusaders 2023 want the transportation minister to succeed Buhari.\n\nHowever, top sources revealed to SaharaReporters on Friday night that Malami was the brains behind the court order obtained from Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General is behind the court ruling in Abia State. He received funds from Amaechi and CBN governor to fund the litigation and find the judge to do so as Abuja Federal Court judges refused to touch the case,\" one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cThe AGF (Malami) was being asked to resign as of last week. He, Amaechi and CBN governor were scared,\u201d another source revealed.\n\nMeanwhile on Friday, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, in the AGF office said the AGF would give effect to the purported judgment without delay.\n\n\u201cThe office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will accordingly give effect to the Court judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe judgment of the Court will be recognized by the Government printers in printing the Electoral Act. The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be so treated accordingly. This is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced,\u201d the AGF office said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Malami had said following the Senate\u2019s refusal, the Nigerian government would consider all other options available to it before a position would be taken.\n\nIt is clear one of the options Malami and others found was a judge to do their bidding.",

          "title": "Why Nigeria needs a third force",
          "text": "In Waziri Adio\u2019s article, \u201cIs Nigeria Due for Another Electoral Upset?\u201d (THISDAY, January 16, 2022), he made a strong and neat argument on the near-impossibility of an upset in the 2023 presidential election. By upset, he meant a third force \u2014 rather than the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2014 upstaging the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). His argument is hinged on several factors, some of which are: the fact that time is running out for the construction of a formidable nationwide vote-winning structure by the would-be third-force candidates; the enormous war chest needed for a presidential run; and the reluctance of the typical voter to bet on candidates with slim chances.\n\nAfter digesting the article, I was almost giving up hope on the leeway for an electoral upset but for his critical caveat: \u201cYou need a formidable political machine or movement capable of taking advantage of the obvious weakness of the established order, capitalising on the widespread discontent, and matching the status quo in grit and wiles for votes in the nooks and crannies of the country.\u201d I have deliberately excised the remaining sentence (\u201cI am yet to figure out such a force or machine on the scene about a year to the next elections\u201d) because it will not serve my purpose today. I want to pursue an argument that we need badly a third force for whatever it is worth.\n\nTo be sure, history does not favour a third force in politics, much less in Nigeria. In most countries, there are usually two parties controlling the game, with a third force putting up a dark horse display once in a blue moon. In Ghana, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) are the dominant parties. In South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC) is fully in control with the Democratic Alliance a very distant second. The Conservatives and Labour regularly exchange the baton in the UK. The Democrats and the Republicans own US politics. In Nigeria, the PDP and APC (in different shapes and sizes) have been dominating the terrain in the fourth republic.\n\nIf I know all these facts, why then am I canvassing a third force? I need to make myself very clear. One, it is going to be extremely difficult to displace the ruling party. We are discussing Third World politics where the state machinery is regularly deployed for political manoeuvres. It took 12 years for the opposition to gain power in Nigeria. It had never even happened before. It was a major upset in 2015. Therefore, the APC will not give up power without putting up a massive fight. Add that to the fact that APC has 21 out of the 36 governors. We know governors are the most powerful bloc. They control most of the field commanders and the war chest. That is what we mean by \u201cstructure\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, conventional wisdom is that if any party is going to displace the APC, it has to be the PDP because of its history, experience and structure. PDP controlled power for 16 years, at a point threatening to rule Nigeria for 60 years non-stop. The natural alternative, as it should be, is the PDP. But a party that once controlled 31 states is now a pathetic shadow of itself with so many egos clashing on a daily basis. I concede that politicians would always want to control a party\u2019s structure in order to be relevant, to be able to call the shots. But you can see the lack of tact and maturity in the leadership. The legal tussles and media wars are no doubt jeopardising the party\u2019s chances.\n\nThis is why I think we need a third force. However, my concept of third force is slightly different from the conventional one. We see third force typically as a \u201cthird political party\u201d that will cause an electoral upset. Why not? It could indeed be a party that will come from nowhere and disrupt the flow of things \u2014 as the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) did in the south-east in 2003 and the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in far northern states in 2011. CPC and a faction of APGA are now part of APC. We should also remember that Dr Segun Mimiko became governor of Ondo state on the ticket of the Labour Party (LP) in 2007. But my perception is a bit extended beyond this.\n\nWhile a third force can be a \u201cthird party\u201d, it can also be a movement \u2014 a \u201cthird way\u201d, if you like. There are many Nigerians who do not belong to either PDP or APC, so they are not limited by rigid political affiliations. I think they are in the majority. Globally, most voters are not registered party members. Some vote according to the traditions, sympathies, ideologies and sentiments they identify with, not because they are card-carrying members of a party. Some others vote on a case-by-case basis, with no particular loyalty. They look at the candidates or the issues per time. That is why power regularly changes hands in some countries. It is not that party members defected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis third force I am thinking of, therefore, can be a \u201cthird party\u201d or a \u201cthird way\u201d. Both are desirable because it has become glaring to us now that APC and PDP are conjoined in the head and are behaving like Siamese twins. This should not be a surprise. The gap between the two parties is not as long as a bridge. In fact, someone can eat breakfast in APC at 7am, cross over to PDP for lunch and is back in time to APC for dinner. Many commentators say it is because of lack of distinct ideology but I think it is also lack of principles. The archetypal Nigerian politician does not want to be in the kitchen sweating it out and preparing the food. He or she is rather looking for where food is ready.\n\nOrdinarily, APC and PDP should be competing for our votes by trying to outperform each other at all levels of government. This healthy competition should make the voters spoilt for choice. If APC is in power and does not deliver the goods, it should be afraid that voters may choose PDP the next time. The possibility of alternation of power should make the parties sit up, knowing that they can be thrown out. This is one of the beauties of democracy. But it would appear APC and PDP \u2014 because they look and behave so much alike \u2014 do not care too much about the likely reaction of the voters. They think their parties are safe in their territories. They are not always right, as we saw in 2015.\n\nWe can learn from 2015. The ruling party, which called itself the \u201clargest party in Africa\u201d (its Siamese sibling has now proudly taken over the title) lost for the first time since 1999. This is where my idea of a third force, or third way, comes in. Although many factors and forces pushed PDP out of power, we cannot deny the role of the \u201cthird force\u201d: Nigerians were generally tired of the status quo. They were tired of amateurism in government. They were tired of the open show of corruption. They were tired of the insecurity across the land. They wanted a change. APC appeared on the scene at the right time, said the right thing and coined the right slogans to mobilise the popular sentiments.\n\nWhat then? While it may be extremely difficult for a \u201cthird party\u201d to win power in 2023 because of the complex nature of electoral politics (including notably the need to build a vote-winning machinery and a heavy war chest), the \u201cthird way\u201d movement is still alive and active. There are millions of Nigerians who do not owe an allegiance to APC or PDP. There are millions of Nigerians who are still not pleased with the state of the nation and are ready to cast their votes for the candidate they think would make a big difference in their lives, no matter the parties they belong. It does not take an eternity to mobilise these sentiments. We all saw what happened in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, this is where I am going: the knowledge that there is a mass movement of Nigerians out there, which I call the \u201cthird force\u201d or \u201cthird way\u201d, should propel APC and PDP to consider the quality of candidates they will field in 2023. If Nigerians are fully persuaded that one candidate is better than the other, I can see the 2015 spirit coming back to play. Although many people eventually regretted voting for APC because they are unhappy with the performance of President Muhammadu Buhari in office, the basic principle has been established: that if these \u201cfreelance\u201d voters believe one party is fielding a better candidate, they can be mobilised to join other forces in voting him or her into office.\n\nI am not completely dismissing the idea that the \u201cthird force\u201d can be a party if certain things fall in place. One, there must be a coalition of powerful political heavyweights who have the structures and the wherewithal to win elections. And there are only two places we can hope that these heavyweights will come from: the same APC and PDP. There will, expectedly, be fall-outs in those parties after their presidential primaries. I see some of them pulling out or resorting to anti-party manoeuvres because of the outcome of the primaries. This rebellion, if well-harvested, can provide a pool of heavyweights who can give the third force a realistic election-winning structure.\n\nTwo, the heavyweight political forces can team up the \u201cthird way\u201d movement to back the preferred candidate of a \u201cthird party\u201d. One big challenge would be how to get the movement to work with the political heavyweights without being judgmental. For sure, the political heavyweights are not going to be saints; we can only hope that they would be motivated by the need for a new kind of leadership for Nigeria. If people who want a new kind of Nigeria can be backed by those who have the structure to make it happen, why can\u2019t they work together? It happened in 2015 and the fact that some people are disappointed with the outcome does not mean it cannot happen again.\n\nThree, there must be a \u201cnew wave\u201d candidate who would be the flagbearer of the \u201cthird party\u201d. That is the biggest challenge. The new electoral act, along with the election timetable released by INEC, will make things quite difficult. Anyone who wants to run in the 2023 presidential election has to participate in party primaries which must be concluded by June 3, 2022. If Nigerians are going to rally round a third party, at least they should have an idea of the candidate by now. This is one of the points in Adio\u2019s article. There is work to do and if we cannot see anything clearly now, we should not expect a miracle. By this time in 2014, the APC was already consolidating and strategising for 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn conclusion, I admit that the possibility of a \u201cthird party\u201d producing the president is extremely low, but we should not rule out the chances of a \u201cthird way\u201d playing a critical role in electing the next president \u2014 either by supporting the stronger candidate between APC and PDP, as they have done before to good effect, or by supporting a \u201cnew wave\u201d candidate by collaborating with dissident heavyweights to back a \u201cthird party\u201d. Whatever the case, we need another way of playing politics. We need a force, or a movement, to put APC and PDP on their toes so that they can get serious with the quality of candidates they want to present in 2023. We need a healthy political competition.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nJUDICIAL ABRACADABRA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an unprecedented judgment, a federal high court sitting in Umuahia, Abia state, on Friday gave legislative powers to the attorney-general of the federation (AGF). In a case regarding the Electoral Act requirement for political appointees to resign 30 days to party primaries, the judge asked the AGF to amend the law by deleting the clause. Nowhere in the world does the attorney-general have such powers. A judge can declare a law illegal but to ask the AGF to amend it by deleting a clause is unprecedented. I hope the National Judicial Council (NJC) will look into this. By the time our politicians are done with the judiciary, we may have nothing left of the temple of justice. Terrifying.\n\nSLAPDASH INAUGURATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe slapping saga between Mrs Bianca Ojukwu and Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano dominated news on Thursday, overshadowing the little matter of Prof Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s inauguration as the governor of Anambra state. The subject became the predicate. For Ndi Anambra, that was a slap in the face. Soludo represents a brand of leaders that many Nigerians want in power: an accomplished intellectual with a proven record in public service. There are many of them in our midst who do not have the privilege of being in the driving seat. That is why I am on my knees praying that Soludo will succeed. All he needs to make a difference is to focus on the most important things. Possibilities.\n\nHARSH TIMES\n\nWhen it rains, it pours.

          "title": "Why Nigeria needs a third force",
          "text": "In Waziri Adio\u2019s article, \u201cIs Nigeria Due for Another Electoral Upset?\u201d (THISDAY, January 16, 2022), he made a strong and neat argument on the near-impossibility of an upset in the 2023 presidential election. By upset, he meant a third force \u2014 rather than the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2014 upstaging the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). His argument is hinged on several factors, some of which are: the fact that time is running out for the construction of a formidable nationwide vote-winning structure by the would-be third-force candidates; the enormous war chest needed for a presidential run; and the reluctance of the typical voter to bet on candidates with slim chances.\n\nAfter digesting the article, I was almost giving up hope on the leeway for an electoral upset but for his critical caveat: \u201cYou need a formidable political machine or movement capable of taking advantage of the obvious weakness of the established order, capitalising on the widespread discontent, and matching the status quo in grit and wiles for votes in the nooks and crannies of the country.\u201d I have deliberately excised the remaining sentence (\u201cI am yet to figure out such a force or machine on the scene about a year to the next elections\u201d) because it will not serve my purpose today. I want to pursue an argument that we need badly a third force for whatever it is worth.\n\nTo be sure, history does not favour a third force in politics, much less in Nigeria. In most countries, there are usually two parties controlling the game, with a third force putting up a dark horse display once in a blue moon. In Ghana, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC) are the dominant parties. In South Africa, the African National Congress (ANC) is fully in control with the Democratic Alliance a very distant second. The Conservatives and Labour regularly exchange the baton in the UK. The Democrats and the Republicans own US politics. In Nigeria, the PDP and APC (in different shapes and sizes) have been dominating the terrain in the fourth republic.\n\nIf I know all these facts, why then am I canvassing a third force? I need to make myself very clear. One, it is going to be extremely difficult to displace the ruling party. We are discussing Third World politics where the state machinery is regularly deployed for political manoeuvres. It took 12 years for the opposition to gain power in Nigeria. It had never even happened before. It was a major upset in 2015. Therefore, the APC will not give up power without putting up a massive fight. Add that to the fact that APC has 21 out of the 36 governors. We know governors are the most powerful bloc. They control most of the field commanders and the war chest. That is what we mean by \u201cstructure\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, conventional wisdom is that if any party is going to displace the APC, it has to be the PDP because of its history, experience and structure. PDP controlled power for 16 years, at a point threatening to rule Nigeria for 60 years non-stop. The natural alternative, as it should be, is the PDP. But a party that once controlled 31 states is now a pathetic shadow of itself with so many egos clashing on a daily basis. I concede that politicians would always want to control a party\u2019s structure in order to be relevant, to be able to call the shots. But you can see the lack of tact and maturity in the leadership. The legal tussles and media wars are no doubt jeopardising the party\u2019s chances.\n\nThis is why I think we need a third force. However, my concept of third force is slightly different from the conventional one. We see third force typically as a \u201cthird political party\u201d that will cause an electoral upset. Why not? It could indeed be a party that will come from nowhere and disrupt the flow of things \u2014 as the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) did in the south-east in 2003 and the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in far northern states in 2011. CPC and a faction of APGA are now part of APC. We should also remember that Dr Segun Mimiko became governor of Ondo state on the ticket of the Labour Party (LP) in 2007. But my perception is a bit extended beyond this.\n\nWhile a third force can be a \u201cthird party\u201d, it can also be a movement \u2014 a \u201cthird way\u201d, if you like. There are many Nigerians who do not belong to either PDP or APC, so they are not limited by rigid political affiliations. I think they are in the majority. Globally, most voters are not registered party members. Some vote according to the traditions, sympathies, ideologies and sentiments they identify with, not because they are card-carrying members of a party. Some others vote on a case-by-case basis, with no particular loyalty. They look at the candidates or the issues per time. That is why power regularly changes hands in some countries. It is not that party members defected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis third force I am thinking of, therefore, can be a \u201cthird party\u201d or a \u201cthird way\u201d. Both are desirable because it has become glaring to us now that APC and PDP are conjoined in the head and are behaving like Siamese twins. This should not be a surprise. The gap between the two parties is not as long as a bridge. In fact, someone can eat breakfast in APC at 7am, cross over to PDP for lunch and is back in time to APC for dinner. Many commentators say it is because of lack of distinct ideology but I think it is also lack of principles. The archetypal Nigerian politician does not want to be in the kitchen sweating it out and preparing the food. He or she is rather looking for where food is ready.\n\nOrdinarily, APC and PDP should be competing for our votes by trying to outperform each other at all levels of government. This healthy competition should make the voters spoilt for choice. If APC is in power and does not deliver the goods, it should be afraid that voters may choose PDP the next time. The possibility of alternation of power should make the parties sit up, knowing that they can be thrown out. This is one of the beauties of democracy. But it would appear APC and PDP \u2014 because they look and behave so much alike \u2014 do not care too much about the likely reaction of the voters. They think their parties are safe in their territories. They are not always right, as we saw in 2015.\n\nWe can learn from 2015. The ruling party, which called itself the \u201clargest party in Africa\u201d (its Siamese sibling has now proudly taken over the title) lost for the first time since 1999. This is where my idea of a third force, or third way, comes in. Although many factors and forces pushed PDP out of power, we cannot deny the role of the \u201cthird force\u201d: Nigerians were generally tired of the status quo. They were tired of amateurism in government. They were tired of the open show of corruption. They were tired of the insecurity across the land. They wanted a change. APC appeared on the scene at the right time, said the right thing and coined the right slogans to mobilise the popular sentiments.\n\nWhat then? While it may be extremely difficult for a \u201cthird party\u201d to win power in 2023 because of the complex nature of electoral politics (including notably the need to build a vote-winning machinery and a heavy war chest), the \u201cthird way\u201d movement is still alive and active. There are millions of Nigerians who do not owe an allegiance to APC or PDP. There are millions of Nigerians who are still not pleased with the state of the nation and are ready to cast their votes for the candidate they think would make a big difference in their lives, no matter the parties they belong. It does not take an eternity to mobilise these sentiments. We all saw what happened in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, this is where I am going: the knowledge that there is a mass movement of Nigerians out there, which I call the \u201cthird force\u201d or \u201cthird way\u201d, should propel APC and PDP to consider the quality of candidates they will field in 2023. If Nigerians are fully persuaded that one candidate is better than the other, I can see the 2015 spirit coming back to play. Although many people eventually regretted voting for APC because they are unhappy with the performance of President Muhammadu Buhari in office, the basic principle has been established: that if these \u201cfreelance\u201d voters believe one party is fielding a better candidate, they can be mobilised to join other forces in voting him or her into office.\n\nI am not completely dismissing the idea that the \u201cthird force\u201d can be a party if certain things fall in place. One, there must be a coalition of powerful political heavyweights who have the structures and the wherewithal to win elections. And there are only two places we can hope that these heavyweights will come from: the same APC and PDP. There will, expectedly, be fall-outs in those parties after their presidential primaries. I see some of them pulling out or resorting to anti-party manoeuvres because of the outcome of the primaries. This rebellion, if well-harvested, can provide a pool of heavyweights who can give the third force a realistic election-winning structure.\n\nTwo, the heavyweight political forces can team up the \u201cthird way\u201d movement to back the preferred candidate of a \u201cthird party\u201d. One big challenge would be how to get the movement to work with the political heavyweights without being judgmental. For sure, the political heavyweights are not going to be saints; we can only hope that they would be motivated by the need for a new kind of leadership for Nigeria. If people who want a new kind of Nigeria can be backed by those who have the structure to make it happen, why can\u2019t they work together? It happened in 2015 and the fact that some people are disappointed with the outcome does not mean it cannot happen again.\n\nThree, there must be a \u201cnew wave\u201d candidate who would be the flagbearer of the \u201cthird party\u201d. That is the biggest challenge. The new electoral act, along with the election timetable released by INEC, will make things quite difficult. Anyone who wants to run in the 2023 presidential election has to participate in party primaries which must be concluded by June 3, 2022. If Nigerians are going to rally round a third party, at least they should have an idea of the candidate by now. This is one of the points in Adio\u2019s article. There is work to do and if we cannot see anything clearly now, we should not expect a miracle. By this time in 2014, the APC was already consolidating and strategising for 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn conclusion, I admit that the possibility of a \u201cthird party\u201d producing the president is extremely low, but we should not rule out the chances of a \u201cthird way\u201d playing a critical role in electing the next president \u2014 either by supporting the stronger candidate between APC and PDP, as they have done before to good effect, or by supporting a \u201cnew wave\u201d candidate by collaborating with dissident heavyweights to back a \u201cthird party\u201d. Whatever the case, we need another way of playing politics. We need a force, or a movement, to put APC and PDP on their toes so that they can get serious with the quality of candidates they want to present in 2023. We need a healthy political competition.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nJUDICIAL ABRACADABRA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an unprecedented judgment, a federal high court sitting in Umuahia, Abia state, on Friday gave legislative powers to the attorney-general of the federation (AGF). In a case regarding the Electoral Act requirement for political appointees to resign 30 days to party primaries, the judge asked the AGF to amend the law by deleting the clause. Nowhere in the world does the attorney-general have such powers. A judge can declare a law illegal but to ask the AGF to amend it by deleting a clause is unprecedented. I hope the National Judicial Council (NJC) will look into this. By the time our politicians are done with the judiciary, we may have nothing left of the temple of justice. Terrifying.\n\nSLAPDASH INAUGURATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe slapping saga between Mrs Bianca Ojukwu and Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano dominated news on Thursday, overshadowing the little matter of Prof Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s inauguration as the governor of Anambra state. The subject became the predicate. For Ndi Anambra, that was a slap in the face. Soludo represents a brand of leaders that many Nigerians want in power: an accomplished intellectual with a proven record in public service. There are many of them in our midst who do not have the privilege of being in the driving seat. That is why I am on my knees praying that Soludo will succeed. All he needs to make a difference is to focus on the most important things. Possibilities.\n\nHARSH TIMES\n\nWhen it rains, it pours. As Nigerians were still battling the methanol-induced petrol scarcity, aviation fuel decided to become elusive and expensive, resulting in fare hikes and fears of grounding flights altogether. Meanwhile, the Russia-Ukraine war has impacted on crude oil prices, pushing up the prices of diesel and gas. In Nigeria, the national grid \u2014 the highway through which electricity is transported from generating plants to distribution companies \u2014 recorded a couple of collapses, thereby plunging the nation into darkness.

          "text": "Google has announced that Equiano, a subsea internet cable running through Portugal to South Africa, will first land in Togo. Equiano is expected to land in South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena later in the year, connecting the continent with Europe.\n\nThis announcement marks a milestone in Google\u2019s plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Last October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa, of which project Equiano is part of.\n\nMap of Africa indicating Lisbon, Togo, and Cape Town landings with branching units\n\nFor Togo which currently ranks as the sixth-best country in Africa regarding ease of doing business, the landing of Equiano opens up more possibilities and opportunities. It\u2019s expected that once connected to Equiano, it will provide 20 times more bandwidth than any other cable currently serving West Africa, helping Togo attract even more investments and further boosting its vibrant startup culture.\n\n\u201cBroadening the access to high-speed internet is a fundamental part in our national digital development process as we strive towards achieving the objectives set out in our Digital 2025 Strategy,\u201d Cina Lawson, Minister of Digital Economy and Digital Transformation for Togo said.\n\nAccording to an economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo from Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics, it is estimated that the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional USD 351 million during the same period.\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa commented, \u201cThe landing of Equiano affirms Google\u2019s commitment to the African continent, to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation. We are thrilled that Togo will be Equiano\u2019s first landing on the African continent, as it aligns with the country\u2019s continuing efforts to promote digital inclusion for Africa.\u201d\n\nThis announcement is coming a year after Google shut down project Loon, a cost-effective solution to the difficult challenge of bringing internet access to people in underserved remote areas. The shutdown of Google\u2019s Project Loon brought up questions about the fate of Google\u2019s other internet projects targeted at Africa.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls. To him, it\u2019s not all racism though. \u201cYes, they didn\u2019t want black people to cross through first\u2014that\u2019s no surprise. But I also think there were too many people at those borders; everyone was on edge. They got the worst of it, the ones who tried to leave in that first week; they saw the worst of everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after the invasion, almost all the black students had left Ternopil, and only Fortune and his friends were left. \u201cWhen we went out, people glared at us as if to say, \u2018Why are these ones still here?\u2019 That\u2019s when we knew it was time to leave.\u201d\n\nHe packed a suitcase, left most of his belongings behind, and hightailed it to the Hungarian border where French volunteers were helping African students fill out applications for refugee status and living permits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Fortune is writing the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MBCN) qualifying exams in Nigeria, and then finding a way to get to the UK. \u201cBefore all this,\u201d he says. \u201cI was already applying for visas to leave Ukraine for the UK where my brother is.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s journey is not so certain. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure of what\u2019s going to happen to all of us. They say we can transfer to Hungarian schools, but it\u2019s not certain yet. I\u2019d still prefer to finish in Ukraine, though.\u201d She hopes that the war will end before her 30-day permit is up so that she can return to her apartment in Ukraine where most of her belongings are.\n\nWhen we ask Akam about his next steps, no response comes.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend? The Batman was the most-watched movie in Nigerian cinemas, with an admission of above 12,000 tickets and gross revenue of \u20a627.2 million.\n\nThe chart above shows the top movies people saw at the cinemas in Nigeria last weekend.\n\nTo see interesting statistics and charts like this, please, follow Techpoint Intelligence at @techpointintel on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are on Twitter, you might likely have read content from Zikoko, TechCabal, or both. Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWasoko\u2019s $125m Series B\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s exit from Farmcrowdy\n\nSokowatch, now Wasoko, raises $125m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudging Africa\u2019s eCommerce industry through the Jumia lens, it\u2019s possible to conclude that Africa isn\u2019t ready for the industry. Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka. After Akumah\u2019s exit as CEO, Akinlade Philips took the role. This new exit means Akumah no longer has ties with Farmcrowdy going forward.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nThe Task That Must Be Done.

          "title": "Meet P.Priime: From Sarz Academy to Carpe Diem to V",
          "text": "When you google \u2018top Afrobeats producers of 2021,\u2019 you\u2019ll almost certainly find \u2018P.Priime\u2019 at the top of the list or somewhere close to the peak of the listings depending on the website\u2019s author.\n\nIn a competitive and fickle industry, BusinessDay examines how a Sarz Academy graduate becomes the guy everyone wants on their team.\n\nP.Priime\u2019s early life\n\nPeace Emmanuel Oredope popularly known as P.Priime may be young but has made himself one of the most sorts after music producers in the realm of Afrobeats and with his works on top streamed songs on streaming chart listings 2021, he might as well be one of the major players in the Nigerian music industry taking Afrobeats to the world.\n\nGrowing up in a family that appreciates and immerse themselves in music, Oredope attended an Anglican church and with most of his siblings being choristers, he started playing the drums at the age of four and moved on to mastering the piano at eight years.\n\nAfter high school, while waiting to get admitted to the university, Oredope developed an interest in DJing and began experimenting with production software on his laptop, figuring he was making sounds not realizing it was the start of something big.\n\nRead also: Music meets tech at Future Insiders powered by YouTube Music, The Temple Company\n\nThe Sarz Academy\n\nAfter seeing a post on Instagram about a music production academy, by Osabuohien Osaretin, popularly known as Sarz one who Priime tells BusinessDay is like an \u2018industry Dad\u2019, he was reluctant to apply because at the time he felt there were so many producers that were more creative and would easily get picked before his mediocre\u2019 beats would be considered.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case, as he was chosen to attend the academy for a month, which he described as a \u201cfun, informative, eye-opening\u201d activity that allowed him to connect with like-minded people who had helped him along his path.\n\nPriime described Sarz as a father figure who he looks to for help on anything related to the music industry in general when speaking with BusinessDay about his influence on his career.\n\nThe academy opened doors to connect with people like Zlatan Ibile creating beats for songs like \u2018Unripe pawpaw\u2019 and the viral \u2018Egungun Be Careful\u2019 before working on his \u2018Resan\u2019 album in 2021.\n\nCareer so far\n\nThe 20 years old over the past couple of years have put himself at the vanguard of current sounds brewing underground in Nigeria according to Pan African Music.\n\nHe has collaborated with artists such as Olamide in recent years, creating the majority of the tracks on his Carpe Diem album. Priime hailed the collaboration with Olamide, one of the biggest stars in Nigerian music, as a \u201cdream come true.\u201d\n\nP.Priime was able to send his beats to the Nigerian rapper through his manager, and the rest, as they say, is history as they collaborated on his eleventh studio album Carpe Diem in 2020, an album that surpassed 500 million streams in mid-2021 and was ranked among the top 10 albums that made commercial waves in 2021 by BusinessDay.\n\nPriime has produced songs for Teni\u2019s WONDALAND album, produced Anoti on Wizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos album, and produced the beats for one of the most popular songs of 2021, \u2018Ozumba Mbadiwe,\u2019 to which he attributes his success to the positive reception it received from fans.\n\nAsa\u2019s V album\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Asa released V, a cryptically titled album that marked a stylistic shift from her contemporary jazz genre to a more mainstream type of Afro-Pop music, an album that many critics regarded as an evident indication of a change in style, lyrics, and technical sound. Based on his prior work, this album is a testament to what P.Priime can do with an album.\n\nP. Priime told BusinessDay that working with Asa was easy as both of them bonded well as they both desired the same result which was to make good music while exploring new sounds.\n\n\u201cAsa is someone who enjoys experimenting with new sounds, and she not only allowed me the freedom to be myself, but she also showed me a path I didn\u2019t think I could take,\u201d\n\nHe claims that the vocalist elevates the music to a new level, bringing out the best in each other while having fun composing beats and creating a terrific record.\n\nBusiness of Music Production\n\nThe Nigerian music industry only recently started putting a closer look on the welfare of producers who have long been afflicted with The lack of proper credit, royalties, and poor compensation\n\nIn an interview, Sarz revealed that he founded the academy not only for music but also for producers to gain a holistic view of the business of the industry.\n\nRead also: Olamide, Motha on Glo-sponsored African Voices on CNN\n\n\u201cThe Academy isn\u2019t really just about music production, we also deal with the music business and the legal aspects as well, so any producer that comes out of the Academy is well rounded and you have like an attorney assigned to you moving forward so you don\u2019t sign slave contracts and anything you don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Osaretin.\n\nWhile there is a defined reward system for producers and songwriters in other places like the US and UK, this has not been the case for most Nigerian music producers. They may need to hire a manager or lawyer who is familiar with the music industry to keep an eye on the method by which they are compensated after collaborating with artists.\n\nP.Priime also told BusinessDay that his manager is in charge of all of his enterprises, which he trusts to get him adequately compensated in terms of streaming revenue, intellectual property, project collaborations, brand development, and marketing.\n\n\u201cI leave the business side of what I do to my manager; mine is to make sure the music is intact for the fans to enjoy, while hers is to make sure I\u2019m paid correctly in the business aspect and I\u2019m properly credited; I\u2019m not sure how she does it, but she does a great job of making sure I am well compensated and properly credited,\u201d said Oredope\n\nWhen asked about building a business around music production and how producers can get sponsorships compared to musicians, Oredope told BuisnessDay that artists and producers see each other as equals and should get the same recognition and opportunities to deals.\n\n\u201cI do not see myself as a music producer, I see myself as a musician, the same way an artist sees himself as a brand. I and the artists I\u2019ve worked with see ourselves as equals, we are all superstars,\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that some producers are getting the same deals as some top artists and sometimes more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just a music producer; it\u2019s not like one person is better than the other. Whatever deals musicians get, you can bet I\u2019m getting double.\u201d\n\nFrom Sarz Academy to Zlatan, Olamide, Wizkid, Teni, Wizkid, Reekado Banks, ending the year with Portable\u2019s \u2018Zazoo Zehh\u2019 and Asa\u2019s \u2018V\u2019, P.Priime has made himself a brand everyone wants to work with, as we expect more sounds in 2022.\n\n\u201cMy favourite body of work at the moment has to be Asa\u2019s album, it\u2019s on a whole new level. Expect surprises from P.Priime in 2022,\u201d P. Priime said.",

          "title": "Ponzi schemes: Investors\u2019 greed or dearth of investible products?",
          "text": "While Nigeria\u2019s apex capital market regulator continues the \u201ccatch-up play\u201d with the growing number of illegal fund managers also called Ponzi Schemes, investors who are eagerly looking for higher returns should also factor in risking their \u2018investments\u2019 amid regulatory clamp down on the Ponzi merchants.\n\nPonzi schemes are \u2018investment\u2019 schemes that promise unrealistic returns which ordinarily should be treated with caution. The merchants target greedy investors in their push to grow their pyramid schemes which pay returns to their investors from capital paid to the operators by new investors, rather than from profit earned through legitimate sources.\n\nBen Llewellyn-Jones, The British Deputy High Commissioner to Nigeria had in February during a meeting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) canvassed the need for the SEC to create more alternative options for investments for all classes of people as one of the ways of pulling people away from unregulated space.\n\n\u201cThe more you can create alternative options the easier it is to pull people away from unregulated space and that is why the Sandbox is so attractive to us and why we encourage it. We come across these fintech players and they are formidably driven in their vision,\u201d Llewellyn-Jones said.\n\nThe SEC while reaffirming its commitment to making the capital market attractive to Nigerians of all ages and economic status said the Commission is implementing various initiatives to ensure that products and offerings in the market are accessible to both the young and old whom he said would further deepen the market.\n\n\u201cIn this market what we have seen is that where people do have ready access to interesting products in the regulated market, they then gravitate towards the parallel markets and the Ponzi schemes and really the task of the Commission is to as much as possible move money away from Ponzi schemes to the regulated market,\u201d said Lamido Yuguda, the director-general of the SEC.\n\nTo the apex regulator, investors are always advised to confirm if the investment product, scheme, or company is registered with the SEC before investing. This could easily be done through the SEC website: www.sec.gov.ng or via email to sec@sec.gov.ng; or from other regulatory authorities.\n\nAccording to SEC DG, \u201cWhen we assumed office, we were shocked to know that the average age of the Central Securities Clearing System account holder was over 50 years. The CSCS is a depository so if you are investing in equities you must have a CSCS account.\n\n\u201cThe average age of that account holder was over 50, and that indicated to us that the young people were not participating in this market and when young people are not participating in any market, that market is doomed to fail. And young people today prefer to do things on their phones. If you have to fill a stack of forms manually young people won\u2019t do it. We want to make investing in the capital market a fun experience.\n\n\u201cThe capital market experience starts with a bank account and eventually the distribution has to hit a bank account as well. So we decided to look at the whole process and find out what is turning young people off. We have started the process and seen how the tech companies are providing much-needed relief to the kind of bureaucracy that happens in the capital market.\n\nHe stated that with e-offers, a lot of Nigerians would be happy to invest in the capital market and that would dissuade people from patronising illegal schemes thereby leading to the development of the capital market and the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cBut we get a sense they need to work with regulators to make it work and they recognise that it\u2019s the right way to be attracted to investment and grow the way they want. They are formidably talented and it is really encouraging. We are very keen to work with you and your approach and that\u2019s very heartening and the appetite for innovation is what has attracted us to that the most,\u201d Llewellyn-Jones said.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission recently sealed the premises of Oxford International Group/Oxford Commercial Services, Farmforte Agro-Allied Solutions Limited/Agro Partnerships as well as Vektr Capital Investment/Vektr Enterprise for illegally engaging in capital market activities.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s relevance waning among foreign investors\n\nThe SEC said the offices of the companies in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja were shut down for carrying out investment operations that fall within the ambit of fund management without registration with the apex regulator contrary to the provisions of the Investments and Securities Act 2007.\n\n\u201cThese companies do not have registration of the SEC to conduct fund management activities and have been found to promise exorbitant rates of returns to lure investors. The SEC has exercised its powers under Section 13 (w) Investments and Securities Act 2007, to shut them down. The Commission hereby notifies the investing public that none of these entities or their investment platforms are registered by the SEC,\u201d SEC noted.\n\nLamido had at the opening ceremony of a National Fact-Checking Course organised by the National Orientation Agency (NOA) said SEC is engaging NOA as well as regulators of public agencies to curb the activities of illegal operators. Yuguda, who was represented by the executive commissioner corporate services of the SEC, Ibrahim Boyi, stated that Nigeria\u2019s investment climate has continued to witness the proliferation of illegal fund managers (Ponzi Schemes) as the promoters of these schemes continue to defraud millions of citizens, by promising them mind-boggling returns on investments.\n\n\u201cSuch schemes with all the illegality and promises of unrealistic returns have burnt the fortunes of many ambitious investors, from Yuan Dong Ponzi to Galaxy Transport, Famzhi Interbiz Limited, Cowlane and Durell, and the infamous Mavrodi Mundial Movement (MMM).\n\n\u201cThe upsurge of these schemes has undermined the reputation of the capital market and dampened investors\u2019 confidence, among other things. This has created a considerable challenge to the growth of our market, and the Commission is striving to change the narrative by instilling a fair, transparent, and orderly market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInvestments enable growth in wealth, thus while encouraging more retail investments, we urge you to invest in investment classes and products approved by the SEC, which can be confirmed through the channels provided above,\u201d the SEC stated.\n\nThe National Assembly is proposing a Bill that will empower the SEC to impose stiffer punishment on promoters of Ponzi Schemes and other unregistered investment schemes. This move by the National Assembly is aimed at combating the menace of Ponzi Schemes and ensuring that the regulator of the capital market is well equipped to stop it. This is part of an amendment to the Investment and Securities Act (ISA) 2007, being proposed by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe second reading of the Bill was done on Thursday, January 20 at the House of Representatives by Babangida Ibrahim representing MalumFashi/Kafur Federal Constituency in Katsina State.\n\nThe amendment is titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to Repeal the Investments and Securities Act, 2007 and Enact the Investments and Securities Bill to Establish Securities and Exchange Commission as the Apex Regulatory Authority for the Nigerian Capital Market as well as regulation of the market to ensure capital formation, the protection of the market to ensure capital formation, the protection of investors, maintain fair, efficient and transparent market and reduction of systematic risk; and for related matters,\u201d\n\nThe SEC continues its campaign against illegal operators in the capital market, especially Ponzi Schemes and has adopted multi-level engagements with media platforms and regulators of publicity agencies in order to curb the reach and activities of these illegal operators.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue our activities towards resolving complaints that have been forwarded to the Commission, it is important to reiterate to the investing public to be wary of unscrupulous schemes that promise unrealistic returns on investment.\n\n\u201cWe will like to use this opportunity to reiterate our commitment towards zero tolerance for market infractions. We urge every capital market operator to operate within the market functions approved for it by the Commission. The Commission will not hesitate to deal decisively with any operator who carries out any activities outside the function(s) approved for it by the Commission. No capital market can grow without discipline and adherence to laid down rules and regulations,\u201d Yuguda told journalists after the second capital market committee meeting in 2021.",

          "text": "Damola Andah is a seasoned talent manager with almost a decade in hiring top talents for innovative and successful businesses within the country. She holds an M.A. in Human Resource Management from the University of Leeds Business School, Leeds, United Kingdom (2010) and a BSc. in Mass Communication from Babcock University, Ilishan, Nigeria (2004). She started her career in 2005 as an Operations Officer with Diamond Bank. In 2012, she joined First City Monument Bank on the Management Development Programme. She held various roles, including Human Resources Project Officer, Performance and Talent Management Officer, Senior Talent Management Officer, Human Resource Business Partner, Lagos, & Southwest Regions and Head, Talent & Succession Programme Management (2019). In this interview with the editor, Lehle Balde, she talks about her career in HR and provides advice for young women.\n\nWho inspires you?\n\na) My Parents- they taught me to be unlimited, fair, and compassionate\n\nb) A mentor Temi Dalley- she was (still is) undeterred in changing the face of HR in Nigeria\n\nc) Jumoke Adenowo for her resolve to change Nigeria by raising transformational leaders.\n\nWhat has been the most challenging aspect of your career, and how have you overcome it?\n\nI was changing a career in the middle of a seemingly growing career. I changed careers and was out of a job despite several attempts to volunteer without pay. Having my mindset on the new career while also keeping abreast of developments in that field helped me overcome, and I eventually got a job in my new career line!\n\nWhat have you learned about people and career management over the years as an HR professional?\n\nFrom my experience, I would say career management is not static, and your career is really in your hands. The sky is not the limit \u2013 you can attain any height you want irrespective of where you start; the sky is big enough for everyone \u2013 there is no limit to what can be achieved. Know what you want, strive towards it by getting the relevant skills and certifications, especially with the world being a global village. Anyone can reach the highest level of their chosen career.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young women on career management and progression?\n\nHave a plan, set your target, run with it. Be focused determined. With gender-dominated roles that might seem to have the odds stacked against you, don\u2019t give up, pursue the progression, give it your best shot, strive harder, be surprised at how you can, and be astonished at how you can open previously shut doors.\n\nRead also: Software Group launches fast-track agency banking to reach Nigeria\u2019s unbanked\n\nHow do we encourage women to negotiate higher salaries?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is pay discrimination, especially in structured institutions where job roles already have defined salary ranges; it doesn\u2019t matter whether the office occupants are male or female. However, where such discrimination exists, women need to consider the value they bring to the table with confidence when negotiating.\n\nWhat advice do you have for your women looking to work in HR?\n\nHR is generally seen as a female forte, and some primary female in-built makes it easier for women. Skills like Interpersonal relationships, emotional intelligence, and management have distinguished women in this field. However, with the constant change in workplace dynamics, the skillsets required to perform in HR are also transforming. Qualities like being empathetic remain crucial, but more than before, HR professionals need to be well-versed with capabilities like business partnering, understanding the business, and using data to make informed decisions while still caring for the employees.\n\nIf you say something to your 16-year-old self-something, what would you say?\n\nIf you can dream it, achieve it; the future is loaded with more!

The objective of the exercise is to capture all into the Edo State Master Plan as it\u2019s necessary for development.\n\n\u201cFrom now till 31st of March, those that will approach us and apply for their building approval will not be charged but after then, charges will apply. I appeal to all to take this window of opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of having your plans are huge as your property is recorded and identified as a legal property on Edo soil and the conveyance letter which is like a legal document is issued to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnsure your building is captured at this time as the Ministry is very cooperative and the exercise will continue every Thursday, Friday and Saturday,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nOn his part, The Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Security, Stephen Idehenre said the state will flag off its farming season on Thursday, March 25, 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe State Government will be flagging off the farming season on Thursday, 25th of March 2022. This year\u2019s farming season should be taken seriously as there will be an interface between farmers and off-takers. The government will provide motorbikes for extension workers to get feedback from extension officers.\u201d\n\nIdehenre further disclosed that since the outbreak of the Lassa fever in Edo, the state has recorded 160 cases and 20 deaths, representing a 13 percent death rate in the state.\n\n\u201cThe disease is a pandemic that is still ravaging some communities across local government areas in Edo State.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Osun State government says it will not be distracted by what it called mischief and lies of former Commissioner for Finance, Wale Bolorunduro, but remains committed to it\u2019s core mandate of ensuring the security and welfare of every resident of the state.\n\nCommissioner for Finance, Mr Bola Oyebamiji stated this in a press statement in response to an earlier publication by the former commissioner.\n\nThe Commissioner said it was unfortunate that Bolorunduro has decided to engage in a self-destructive drama of verbal war, all in a bid to deliberately distract the government from it\u2019s core mandate to the people.\n\nMr Oyebamiji said the write-up by the former commissioner is full of unsubstantiated lies, with regard to the loan repayment figures of the state.\n\nOyebamiji\u2019s full statement reads, \u201cMy attention has been called, yet again, to the needless and ill-motivated vituperation from Wale Bolorunduro, the immediate past Commissioner for Finance in Osun. It is needless because, it was a feeble attempt to draw the current government into the arena of a self-destructive drama of verbal war, the hallmark of the splinter group in the All Progressives Congress (APC) to which Bolorunduro belongs. It is equally ill-motivated considering the prevailing political calculations within the State. Since the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was concluded, in which His Excellency, Governor Gboyega Oyetola emerged as the candidate of our party, attempts are been made to distract the current government from her core mandate; the security and welfare of the good people of Osun. Unfortunately, a million dramatic series of lies from Dr Bolorunduro will not distract us; we remain committed as a government.\n\n\u201cTo the unsubstantiated lies presented by Bolorunduro with regards to the loan repayment figures of the State laced with an attempt to emotively pitch the current government against the last government, to the effect that projects initiated by the last government have been abandoned and the untidy accusation of a cover-up of the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) and Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) figures, below are my responses.\n\n\u201cFirstly, government is a continuum and the current government, based on her financial capacity, has continued to drive many programmes and projects inherited from the last government with a touch of restructuring and improved capacity. For instance, the Oba Adesoji Aderemi road project has moved beyond where it was in 2018 to about 75% completion; the Gbogan-Akoda road has been pushed to 40% completion; the Osogbo-Ila-Odo road is progressing well (up to 60% completion); the Ilesa-Iperindo-Ipetu-Ijesa road project now stood at close to 65% completion among others. Also, legacy programmes such as the OMEAL (the school feeding programme), O-Ambulance (the ambulatory services programme), OYES (the Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme) and many others have been reinvigorated to the satisfaction of the good people of Osun as demonstrated by their continued support to the current Governor. Therefore, the unsubstantiated claim of project or programme abandonment falls flat on its face. This outright falsehood has not yielded any gain to its purveyors in the past, and it will certainly not this time.\n\n\u201cSecondly, to trivialize the volatile nature of the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the State and the statutory revenues from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) in a period of the global crisis is to be clever by half. The Audited Financial Statement of the State is a good source of information regarding this. Therefore, anyone in doubt can access the available information at will. To wrongly accuse the State Government, led by a party you belong, of cover-up is simply irresponsible and infantile. Our IGR figures have always been in the public domain and we will not be ashamed to call the figures in a period of uncertainty. Our last Net Statutory Revenue Allocation from the FAAC which unsettled many indigenes of Osun and sympathizers, expectedly so, stood at -379,914,981.09 (excluding VAT) after the direct monthly deductions of =N=1.8billion were made. I challenge Bolorunduro to controvert this figure with verifiable evidence, if he has any, within the next 72hours.\n\n\u201cThirdly, let me say again for the umpteenth time that the current administration led by His Excellency, Governor Gboyega Oyetola, has not approached any financial entity for any facility since 2018 till date. The Governor, right from November 2018, has sustained his focus on priority spending; critical expenditures of government are been funded based on available resources. Consequently, Bolorunduro\u2019s search for non-existent fresh loan deductions, to satisfy his biased position as a possible explanation for the negative receipt from Net Statutory Revenue Allocation from FAAC in January 2022, is laughable. Our debt figures are in the open. The Debt Management Office (DMO), Osun makes adequate monthly returns to the Debt Management Office, Abuja as a matter of duty. The DMO, Abuja and the relevant offices in Osun are available to clear any genuine doubt, regarding our debt figures, which may be agitating the minds of Bolorunduro.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, I sincerely call on the former Commissioner for Finance, Wale Bolorunduro to be honourable in his new role as opposition within. Much as we welcome a dissenting voice on matters of governance, Governor Gboyega Oyetola deserves to be commended and supported for his forthrightness, dedication, and unparalleled transparency in the administration of the State at this critical time.\u201d",

We thought as somebody who is talking about anti-corruption, he should know that there\u2019s a greater implication for allowing people who are serving as political appointees to take advantage over the other members.\n\n\u201cSo, we call on the National Assembly to totally disregard this call because this call is not meant to defend democracy. It is not meant to defend free, fair and equal opportunity for all. So, Transition Monitoring Group is solidly calling on the National Assembly not to consider this amendment. Now, we have not even tested the law and you want to amend it, so that it will be business as usual. We say no to that,\u201d Rafsanjani stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

According to Bianca, she was stunned by the fact that the former First Lady of the State was already drunk by the early hours of the day.\n\nBianca, a former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain, gave her explanations in a statement she issued in Awka, the Anambra State capital, on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAs the inaugural ceremonies for Prof Charles Soludo and his deputy began and all guests were seated, the Former First Lady of Anambra State, Mrs Ebele Obiano, was noticeably absent. She then arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the ceremony was on. I didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her arrival.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language.\n\n\u201cShe asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting. While I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands.\n\n\u201cShe proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig. She held on to her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA chairman, Umeh (Chief Victor Umeh), told her to leave me and told engaged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode completely speechless.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated. I was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9 am?\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony. This was highly embarrassing to the Governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him.\n\n\u201cLuckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d",

Abubakar Sani-Bello of the state said this during his visit to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), at the Central Primary School, Gwada.\n\nHe said that the federal government had made provisions for the affected communities to move to higher grounds.\n\nSani-Bello said that he would liaise with the Federal Ministry of Works to hasten the release of funds so that people in the affected communities could relocate to higher grounds, as well as payment of compensation.\n\nThe governor, however, sympathised with the people that had been displaced as a result of the activities of bandits, adding that no fewer than \u201c4,000 IDPs are currently at Gwada camp.\u201d\n\nThe governor described the situation at the IDPs camp as \u201cworrisome,\u201d observing that \u201dthere is the need for normalcy to be restored in the affected communities.\n\n\u201dThis is to enable them to return home to avoid the outbreak of epidemics in the camp.\n\n\u201cWe have almost 4,000 IDPs displaced by banditry and the construction of Zungeru dam, some communities have been flooded and are under water and have left, while they have not not been paid compensation.\n\n\u201cThe situation is serious, we are concerned that epidemics can spread, we are making efforts with security agencies as they have been up to the task and have dealt decisively with the bandits\u201d.\n\nSani-Bello raised concern about \u201cthe influx of bandits and Boko Haram elements in and out of Shiroro Local Government.\n\n\u201dThey have continued to detonate improvised explosive devices in Galadima-kogo, just as efforts were ongoing by the security agencies to restore normalcy.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that about twelve local government areas in the state were being occupied by bandits, adding that, security agencies were using new tactics and strategies to neutralise them.\n\nAccording to him, the bandits are taking advantage of the size of the state and few security personnel on ground to perpetrate evil acts.\n\nSani-Bello stated that the security agencies were synergising to fight the criminals.\n\nThe governor also visited Mararaban Dan-danu in Munya Local Government Area, where he interacted with local vigilante groups and hunters.\n\nHe promised to equip them with more sophisticated equipment to combat banditry.\n\nEarlier, Malam Aliyu Umaru, the District Head of Gurumana in Shiroro Local Government Area, told the governor that about seven communities were currently being flooded by waters from construction of Zungeru dam.\n\nHe listed the affected communities to include Gurumana, Palei, Nmachi, Npani, Zangoro, Masuku and Magani.\n\nUmar called on the government to come to their aid by paying compensation to enable the affected communities to relocate to safer places.\n\nAisha Abubakar, one of the victims of banditry, complained about lack of food, accommodation and health facilities as major problem affecting them at the Gwada IDPs camp.\n\nShe called on the government to deploy more security personnel to enable them to return to their communities.",

The I Bianconeri have been a banana peel for the big boys in the Serie A, claiming victories against Juventus and securing draws against Roma and Lazio this season.\n\nNapoli started the game on top, seeing more of the ball, and trying to break down the Udinese defence. However, the I Bianconeri broke the deadlock against the run of play in the 22nd minute via Gerard Deulofeu, who struck a wicked finish past Ospina.\n\nAfter conceding, the Partenopei added some urgency to their play, but could not rattle the Udinese defence even with seven goal attempts.\n\nNapoli entered the second half like a house on fire. And just seven minutes after the restart, Osimhen came in handy for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s team. The Nigerian talisman climbed high to head in a cross from Mario Rui into the net to restore parity.\n\nEleven minutes later, Osimhen scored his eleventh Serie A goal of the season after latching on to a pass from Giovanni Di Lorenzo to make it 2-1 for Napoli.\n\nOsimhen\u2019s two goals put him among African greats including Samuel Etoo, Mohamed Salah, and George Weah, who have scored 10+ goals in two consecutive Serie A seasons.\n\nNapoli held out for the remaining 27 minutes to ensure a 2-1 victory, and were further aided after Pablo Mari was sent off in the 83rd minute.\n\nNapoli are now second, level on points with AC Milan, but have played a game more.\n\nOsimhen will not be able to add to his tally in Napoli\u2019s next league game, though, after picking up a fifth yellow card of the campaign.\n\nHowever, his attention will now turn to Nigeria\u2019s 2022 World Cup playoff tie against Ghana, having missed the Africa Cup of Nations campaign.",

We have worked with many leaders and assessed many across the length and breadth of Nigeria. Governor Yahaya Bello stands out.\n\n\u201cAll the lies they have peddled against him in the past have turned to strength for him and for us Nigerian youths. No retreat, no surrender, until we accomplish our aim, which is God\u2019s will by His grace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief of Staff to the Kogi State Governor, Abdulkareem Jamiu Asuku, who led other invited government officials to the rally, assured the youths that his principal would surely heed their call and address them very soon.\n\n\u201cYou have been consistent in your call for His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello to contest for President come 2023. He has heard you clearly and will not disappoint you. He has demonstrated in Kogi that it is Youths O Clock, and it is paying off with all the giant strides. We will repeat the same feat for Nigeria by the grace of God,\u201d Asuku said.\n\nHe, however, warned the youths against engaging in political thuggery that could smear the good image and integrity of his principal,\n\n\u201cOur President come 2023 insha Allah hates violence and thuggery, you should therefore abhor such acts,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to all the supporters across political parties who had yet to get their voter cards to do so immediately, saying, \u201cThat is the only weapon we need to vote for Yahaya Bello as presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d",

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday confirmed that the immediate-past governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, has been moved to Abuja for further interrogation on fraud allegations.\n\nObiano, who was arrested by the EFCC on Thursday night at the Lagos airport while trying to board a flight to the United States, hours after his handover to the new governor of Anambra State, Charles Soludo, was transferred to Abuja Friday morning.\n\nThe EFCC in a statement last night said Obiano was being interrogated for alleged misappropriation of N37 billion security vote and N5 billion Sure-P funds, totaling N42 billion.\n\nIt alleged that the former governor also used part of the N42 billion to fund political activities in the state.\n\n\u201cWillie Obiano was arrested for alleged misappropriation of public funds, including, N5bn Sure-P and N37billion security vote, which was withdrawn in cash,\u201d said the EFCC.\n\nSources said the EFCC is also in possession of other petitions alleging corruption against Obiano.\n\nOne of such petitions, a source said, alleged massive corruption in the management of the N17bn Paris Club refund to the state.\n\n\u201cThere are also petitions alleging inflated projects, including the Umueri International Airport project whose cost was believed to be exaggerated. The EFCC has been doing its investigations all this while and are convinced that Obiano has a case to answer,\u201d adds the source.\n\nIn September 2021, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra had asked the anti-graft agency to probe the finances of the state in order to unearth \u201cmonumental deception\u201d.\n\nAnambra APC chairman, Basil Ejidike, had alleged that Obiano was \u201cfraudulently\u201d using the state\u2019s security vote.\n\nObiano had been on the watch list of the EFCC following the commission\u2019s letter to the Comptroller General of the Nigeria Immigration Service on November 15, 2021, requesting immigration to place Obiano on a watch list and inform it anytime he was travelling out of the country from any of the international airports and other points of entry and exit.\n\nMeanwhile, the EFCC Friday explained why it arrested the immediate past Governor of Anambra State.\n\nSpeaking with BBC Pidgin, the spokesman of the commission, Wilson Uwajaren said: \u201cObiano had been on our watch list for some time now. He had immunity as a governor and that was why we could not arrest him before now.\n\n\u201cToday he lost his immunity and was traveling out of the country before we finally arrested him. Obiano was arrested and he is still in our custody.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC official promised to provide the anti-graft agency\u2019s next line of action in the coming days.",

          "text": "The Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, Eze Uzu III of Awka, Austin Ndigwe on Friday declared that Ebelechukwu, wife of former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano had desecrated Awka by fighting Bianca, widow of late Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu and that the Gods of the Kingdom must be appeased.\n\nAlso in Friday, Bianca issued a statement about the fight, alleging that Ebelechukwu was drunk when she attacked her.\n\nA fight that broke out on Thursday between the two women during the inauguration of Professor Charles Soludo as Governor resulted in Bianca slapping Ebelechukwu.\n\nEze Ndigwe also ordered Ebelechukwu to apologise to Bianca within seven days to avoid consequences.\n\nThe Obi of Awka, in his press release, said he had given Ebelechukwu seven days to publicly apologise to the entire Igbo people or face serious consequences.\n\nHe said the action of the wife of the former governor was sacrilegious, and that as the monarch of the town, he would have to appease the gods of Awka land to avoid calamities.\n\nThe monarch said: \u201cShe should also tender an unreserved apology to the new Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo for her disgraceful conduct during his inauguration. The same should go for the chief judge of the state who was conducting the swearing in when she descended.\n\n\u201cThis grave sin was committed in the land of Awka which is known for peace and unity. Therefore, as the traditional ruler of the people and chief custodian of our culture, I am under obligation to perform some sacrifices to cleanse our land of this filth and pollution and to appease the gods.\u201d\n\nThe Obi of Awka said he had long spoken to Bianca who told him that what angered her was that Mrs. Obiano walked up to her and called her unprintable names, including querying her presence at the swearing in ceremony.\n\nHe added that a study of the scenario showed that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was deliberate, as she came very much prepared to disrupt the swearing in ceremony.\n\nNdigwe added that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was not only against Mrs. Ojukwu, but also against the late Ojukwu, who is the founder of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), whom his widow came to represent.\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that Bianca was not at that ceremony as Bianca, but as a direct representative of our late father and leader, Chief Odumegwu-Ojukwu, her late husband who pioneered APGA.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Ebele\u2019s action of casting aspersions on her is an affront on the entire Igbo people. It was indeed on Odumegwu-Ojukwu and not on Bianca as a person. This is an insult on Igbo and it must not go unpunished.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that I took Obiano and his wife, Ebere to Bianca Ojukwu where they knelt down while seeking the party\u2019s governorship ticket. Bianca endorsed Obiano and called on all APGA members, including then Governor Obi to support him. Mrs. Obiano has only seven days to apologise as demanded and directed or face serious consequences.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria: AGF Malami Says FG Will Immediately Gazette Electoral Act Without Nullified Section 84(12)",
          "text": "A Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State on Friday nullified the controversial Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 barring political appointees from contesting elections and ordered the Attorney General of the Federation \u201cto delete it forthwith,\u201d saying that it is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.\n\nBarely few hours after the court\u2019s decision, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami issued a statement saying the federal government \u201cwill immediately give effect to the judgment by gazetting it.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had recently signed the electoral bill into law with a caveat that Section 84(12) be deleted in order to deepen democracy in the country.\n\nLast week, the Senate surprisingly threw the request of the president out.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed that the federal government would explore other means including the court to ensure the said portion of the law which he claimed offends other sections of the Constitution was expunged from the amended Act.\n\nDelivering judgment in the matter on Friday, Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court, Umuhia, Abia State, held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge, accordingly, ordered the AGF to forthwith delete Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act.\n\nMalami said his office \u201cwill, accordingly, give effect to the court\u2019s judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the judgment of the Court would be recognised by the government printers in printing the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Umar Gwandu, the AGF said, \u201cThe Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be treated accordingly.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced.\u201d\n\nIn striking down the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike, held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nRecall that last week, a politician and legal practitioner, Nduka Edede, who is a member of Action Alliance (AA) filed a suit at the Federal High Court Umuahia seeking to nullify the Section 84(12) on the grounds that it was inconsistent with Sections 66,107,137 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the court verdict, counsel to the plaintiff, Emeka Ozoani, SAN, said it had restored the rights of Nigerian citizens which vexatious subsection 12 of Section 84 of the Electoral Act sought to abridge.\n\nAccording to him, the court has now, with this judgment, created \u201ca congenial atmosphere for politicking and political space\u201d ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said there was no need again for the National Assembly to bother with amending Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act as requested by President Buhari as the Court has specifically asked the AGF to delete it since it was an illegal law ab initio.\n\nCounsel to the AGF, Chris Nevo said that the court judgment was in tandem with the position of the AGF, who has always held that it was wrong to use the Electoral Act to abridge the rights of political appointees to participate in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cOriginally, we believed that it was a big error on the part of the National Assembly to have inserted the controversial Section 84(12), adding that Nigerians should now heave a sigh of relief as the nation could now face operational issues begging for attention.\u201d\n\nFalana Punches Holes in Ruling\n\nLagos lawyer and human rights activists, Femi Falana has pointed holes in the judgement of Justice Anyadike, saying that political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service.\n\nFalana argues: With respect, the learned trial judge fell into a great error. Sections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution relied upon by his lordship require persons employed in the public service of either the federal government or state governments.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, each of the aforesaid sections provides that \u201cNo person shall be qualified for election into the Senate or House of Reps if: (f) he is a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of any State and has not resigned, withdrawn or retired from such employment 30 days before the date of election.\n\n\u201cBy virtue of section 318 of the Constitution, political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service. To that extent, section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the Judge would have dismissed the case if his attention had been drawn to the cases of Dada V. Adeyeye (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920) 1 At 19 Asogwa V. Chukwu (2003) 4 NWLR (Pt. 811) 540 Ojonye V. Onu & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate Courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
