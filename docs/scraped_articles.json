          "title": "Nigerian news doesn\u2019t make one happy, after listening, I go on my knees to pray \u2013 94-year-old Rev Adejobi",
          "text": "Reverend Mother Olive Adejobi, wife of the late Primate Emmanuel Adejobi of the Church of the Lord, Aladura, recently clocked 94. She speaks about her growing up, ministerial journey and life in old age, in this interview with JANET OGUNDEPO\n\nYou recently celebrated your birthday, how does it feel being 94?\n\nThe celebration was fine and I was happy to see everyone around me \u2013 (church) members, ministers, little children, among others. The church was full on that day. I am so happy. It reminds me of those days when I was energetic. I am no longer as energetic as I used to be.\n\nWhat particular event in your childhood remains unforgettable to you?\n\nThat would be my days in primary school. I attended Ake Abeokuta Primary School. I remember very well that my headmaster was the father of Prof Wole Soyinka. I attended that school until I left Abeokuta for Lagos.\n\nMy father was the late Pa John and my mother, Mama Kehinde John. She was a twin but the Taiwo (twin sister) had died long before I was born. I had a nice time growing up. The law, for us then, was you dared not miss going to church. Every Sunday morning, we attended Sunday School and services in the afternoon and evening. We were trained that way and we got used to it. My mum used to make adire (batik) and she was called Mama Alaaro. I used to follow her to the market to sell adire whenever the market day fell on a Saturday. Also, sometimes if I wasn\u2019t in school, I helped her to make adire patterns. Nobody took over the adire business from my mother because we had to go to school.\n\nIn the olden days, sending girls to school was not that popular. Did your parents have to be convinced to enrol you?\n\nAll my siblings, both male and female, went to school. I don\u2019t know of any female that was not allowed to go to school during my time. We all went to school.\n\nWas your date of birth recorded?\n\nMy father was well-read so I was able to know my date of birth.\n\nWas it true that you once worked with the Nigerian Postal Office Savings Bank at Igbosere, Lagos? What was the experience like for you?\n\nAfter I left Queens College in the 1940s, I worked at the Nigerian Post Office Bank.\n\nHow did you meet your husband?\n\nThat was when I came to Lagos. I was staying with one of my brothers and he (my husband) was a member of the church. That was where the whole thing started.\n\nHow was life and marriage when your husband was alive?\n\nIt was a pleasant time because we were able to carry the responsibility of both the church and the children well. All but one of our children were born in Freetown, Sierra Leone. The last child was born in the United Kingdom.\n\nYour husband went to be with the Lord 30 years ago. How was the experience like for you carrying on with the ministry without him?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t too good but I thank God for accepting me. The early days were not too good because I always remembered him and I would be saying, \u201cIf my husband were to be alive, we would do this and that together.\u201d But after some time, I had to carry on with the help of God. The church had become my family at the time. Before my husband\u2019s demise, we established a seminary, bringing in boys and girls to be trained for the work of God. We sometimes had the older men and women join as well. They were of good use to the establishment of the Church of the Lord, Aladura, Lagos and other parts of Nigeria. We thank God that many of the church branches still exist now.\n\nI was one of the teachers and was also in charge of Diocese C and I had about 11 churches under me. I would visit one or two of the churches almost every Sunday to worship with them, to know what was going on and see to the development of the churches. Most times, I spent my time during the week on some of the challenges and projects for the churches. I hardly had time for myself because I was busy with services, visitation of members who had been absent for some time and counselling of both the young and the elderly. With the help of God, I was able to cope.\n\nAll these things I had started while my husband was still alive and I continued after his death. It became a bit easy for me when my children got married and had their own homes but then I still had to call and check on them and their families, both those who are in Nigeria and abroad. I am happy and proud of that.\n\nIn some churches women are not allowed to officiate. Was there any challenge getting the church to accept your leadership?\n\nIn the Church of the Lord Aladura, we have a school where we train our male and female ministers. Being a woman did not disqualify me from being one of the leading female ministers in the church, even among my peers in other churches. I have joy in doing that. The church is not opposed to women but encourage women to be active in the service of God. We have them in grades as well.\n\nWhat would you say to women who have a ministerial calling but are facing opposition from their church or husbands?\n\nWell, it depends on the church. If the church allows women to be teachers or ministers in their church, you cannot rule it out and as long as they have gone for the training. It also depends on the agreement between the wife and husband. If the husband does not allow it, it may cause some misunderstanding if a woman wants to be a minister of God and she is already trained for it, without the agreement between her and the husband; it might be difficult. For us, as long as you have the training and the agreement is between you and your husband, then the way is open for you to become a minister in the church from the very lowest grade to as far as you can go in the ministry.\n\nWhat are the things the church, in general, is doing wrongly?\n\nWell, the church, not every member anyway, has become hypocritical in the way of service. In those days, we were taught by our parents and the schools we attended to go to church with our Bibles. Then, you were not to go late to church but it is quite different now. The youths these days do not carry their Bibles; instead they carry their smartphones and from there read the Bible, it is wrong and they go to the church late as well. So, you are to carry your Bibles and read from the word of God.\n\nMost churches talk about prosperity but prosperity is different from salvation. We go to church so we may be saved. If you do not go to your workplace or you go late, you will be sacked but people don\u2019t see anything wrong in coming late to church. People don\u2019t try to compare the two. It is a must for you to go to church on Sunday to serve God. And when you go only that one day, you carry your phone and you go late as well. They know the priest cannot sack them but there is someone who is above the priest and that is our heavenly Father who calls us to come before Him so we may receive blessings, not only for our entire life but to show us the way to go to conquer the evils of the day. Many parents do not teach their children these things anymore. Those I trained or taught still go to church with their phones as they find it too heavy to carry their bibles. But thanks be to God that those who will hear will hear and we should also pray that our youths these days will adhere to the knowledge and listen to the voice of God for their entire lives.\n\nWhat makes you happy?\n\nAge does not allow me to do much now; I sleep, have my morning prayers and listen to the news. My favourite presenter is Joyce, I love to hear her and Sandra too. I listen to my radio every day, in the evenings. I love to listen to Ronke Ajayi. I don\u2019t joke with my radio at all. When the news is not good, I am on my knees or my bed, praying, asking God to look down on us in mercy and compassion. Now, Nigerian news does not make you happy, we are not in politics but prayers and supplications before our heavenly father to make things better for us and our children.\n\nI also love to be on the phone with all of my children, they are all around the world now. Thanks to the Europeans who have made the world so close that I can pick up the phone to reach them. I love my grandchildren so much that every Sunday, I can call them one after the other, I miss them so much.\n\nThe youths of the church also come around to visit me. When they come, they sing, and I ask that they be served soft drinks and we enjoy ourselves and pray together. Sometimes they bring their grievances or request for counselling. I have joy in doing it because it gives me time to be closer to them and they to me. By the grace of God, I can lead them, pray with them and make them happy.\n\nDo you tell them a bit of history, what happened during your time as a youth?\n\nYes, they get the benefit of experience. I have lots of pictures of when I was young and they see those fashion styles that were trending then coming back.\n\nYou were 33 years old when Nigeria gained its Independence; how did you feel on that day?\n\nI wasn\u2019t in Nigeria at that time. I had left Nigeria since 1948 to Freetown in Sierra Leone, then to Ghana, then United Kingdom before I finally came back to Nigeria. I was happy but then it would have been better for us to have been on our own without the British rule but now that I have been back home for a long time, I am not too happy, seeing what is going on in the country but I always pray for our nation, from the person at the very top to the least. Being a woman of prayer, that is all I can do, go on my knees to pray so that Nigeria can be a better place not only now but forever. And I know whenever we pray, God listens. He can do all that pleases Him and He will have mercy on those that call on Him.\n\nDid you experience racism while you were in the UK?\n\nNo, I did not. Some British-born blacks attended our churches. We also have some white persons who attended our church and even got married to some blacks. We thank God because He is the God of all.\n\nDo you still have any unfulfilled dreams?\n\nI do not feel unfulfilled, not at all. About this time of my life, I just have to continue to serve Him till the day comes and that is the end of time. I am fulfilled, yes. I worship my father in heaven right from when I wake up in the morning. I pray all the time because there is no work for me to do now, so I use most of my time to worship God.\n\nWhat is your best food?\n\nI have no best food, but early in the morning, the best thing I love to have is a cup of tea, fruits and vegetables. I also prefer chicken, although it might be just a little.\n\nWhat would you want to be remembered for?\n\nI will like the children, both mine and from the church, to remember that the best thing to do is to worship and serve the living God through my teachings in leading them to the way of God. That is the only way that leads them to eternal life, peace, knowledge of God and opens the opportunity for all they need in life.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nIt is an exciting time for lagoscians as one of Lagos\u2019s most exciting events \u2018The Lagos Cocktail Week\u2019 returns after a one-year Covid 19 break. The event which kicked off from Thursday, October 7th, 2021 to run thru October 16th, 2021, with the grand finale at the Balmoral Marquee, Federal Palace Hotel, Victoria Island, promises to be nothing short of exciting.\n\nFounder of the Lagos Cocktail Week and CEO of Eventi Cocktails Lara Rawa, an award-winning mixologist alongside her partners have brought on board some prestigious liquor; Fayrouz, Desperados, Absolut Vodka, Star Radler, Jameson, Olmeca Tequila, Beefeater Gin, Johnnie Walker, and many others for an exhilarating experience this year.\n\nThe event began, with a conference that spells out the values that the partners share; drinking responsibly and above all celebrating Nigerians in their diverse ways and taste. Subsequently, an intriguing cocktail village from October 15 to 16 will be erected that allows all guests to explore the nature of each brand and its essence.\n\nLara Rawa who holds a Law degree from the University of Lagos, and currently a student at the Lagos Business School where she\u2019s studying for her MBA, tells us what to expect at this year\u2019s event amongst other issues.\n\n\n\nWhat is the focus of the Lagos Cocktail week?\n\nWe are here for the Lagos Cocktail week 2021 and this is the 7th edition. The 7th edition should actually have held last year but due to the pandemic we couldn\u2019t do the 7th edition. Also there is a twist to the competition this year. What we usually do for the grand finale is to have one winner but because we want to boost the morale of the bartenders because they were deeply affected in the hospitality industry by the pandemic last year. We planned to have different challenges for different brands and for the brands to also give them prizes. We also insisted that the prize should be cash prizes and they agreed with us. So, today the bartenders have picked the ballot to know what challenge they will be participating in and also hear from the brands regarding the competition and what the challenge prize will be.\n\n\n\nHow did the Lagos Cocktail Week begin?\n\nI think Cocktail found me. I just like to drink cocktails and I think I started my own business about 12 years ago but I am also a mixologist. I am an entrepreneur as well. I have my own cocktail brand and it is called the Eventi cocktails and we are into lots of events. Whilst I was doing this, I felt that I wanted to do more in the industry and that was how I stumbled upon London Cocktail week and then I went to London Cocktail week as a volunteer to work with them..Whilst I was in London with them, I was also thinking of how to do the same thing in Nigeria, that was how the whole idea came and I started the Lagos Cocktail week.\n\n\n\n7 years down the line, how has it been so far?\n\nInitially, it wasn\u2019t easy but I knew where I was going and I needed to show people that vision. So, it wasn\u2019t easy but I believed that with consistency and hard work the brands we are working with today, have seen the positivity of the Lagos Cocktail week and what we stand for.Our three pillars include education, information and entertainment. And we have always done that. I am glad that the brands believed in the vision and they have always supported the vision. There are people as well who believe in the vision and who have always supported the vision as well.So, I am grateful for their support and that is what has propelled the Lagos Cocktail week to this extent.\n\nWhat are the challenges you face in putting this together?\n\nInitially it was funding but I always would work on hanging fruits. I started small and I would go to hotels and tell them to support me. They will give me the support and I would manage it, tailor it to soothe what I have. I always believe in humble beginnings because that is the way you can now tell the story. I am glad that I started the way I did because I never loose sight of my objective and I can see bartenders who are happy. That is the joy for me. When I go to bars and see them they are excited, that means you are impacting lives. Getting them to compete and winning monies that they can use to start something..\n\n\n\nApart from finance what are some of the other challenges?\n\nIt was for people to understand what you are doing because that is key. The platform has always been for bartenders. So, I look around today and see the Presidents of Bartenders Guild as well the Events and beverages Association. These are the umbrellas, the platforms where you have the bartenders and seeing them here means that we are doing the right thing. Now that they understand, the sky is not just the beginning for us.\n\n\n\nThe sector is congested with many who are not certified. Do you intend to regulate the sector?\n\nThat is the job for the Associations to do. The entry into the industry is quite low, easy entry level and there are so many things that you would see. I believe that part of the objective of the Associations is to put in stringent conditions for entry. I believe that this is something they would look into and do eventually.",

Whilst I was doing this, I felt that I wanted to do more in the industry and that was how I stumbled upon London Cocktail week and then I went to London Cocktail week as a volunteer to work with them..Whilst I was in London with them, I was also thinking of how to do the same thing in Nigeria, that was how the whole idea came and I started the Lagos Cocktail week.\n\n\n\n7 years down the line, how has it been so far?\n\nInitially, it wasn\u2019t easy but I knew where I was going and I needed to show people that vision. So, it wasn\u2019t easy but I believed that with consistency and hard work the brands we are working with today, have seen the positivity of the Lagos Cocktail week and what we stand for.Our three pillars include education, information and entertainment. And we have always done that. I am glad that the brands believed in the vision and they have always supported the vision. There are people as well who believe in the vision and who have always supported the vision as well.So, I am grateful for their support and that is what has propelled the Lagos Cocktail week to this extent.\n\nWhat are the challenges you face in putting this together?\n\nInitially it was funding but I always would work on hanging fruits. I started small and I would go to hotels and tell them to support me. They will give me the support and I would manage it, tailor it to soothe what I have. I always believe in humble beginnings because that is the way you can now tell the story. I am glad that I started the way I did because I never loose sight of my objective and I can see bartenders who are happy. That is the joy for me. When I go to bars and see them they are excited, that means you are impacting lives. Getting them to compete and winning monies that they can use to start something..\n\n\n\nApart from finance what are some of the other challenges?\n\nIt was for people to understand what you are doing because that is key. The platform has always been for bartenders. So, I look around today and see the Presidents of Bartenders Guild as well the Events and beverages Association. These are the umbrellas, the platforms where you have the bartenders and seeing them here means that we are doing the right thing. Now that they understand, the sky is not just the beginning for us.\n\n\n\nThe sector is congested with many who are not certified. Do you intend to regulate the sector?\n\nThat is the job for the Associations to do. The entry into the industry is quite low, easy entry level and there are so many things that you would see. I believe that part of the objective of the Associations is to put in stringent conditions for entry. I believe that this is something they would look into and do eventually.",

Almost all the time. I attended a mixed secondary school and the names classmates were calling me behind my back and in my face were quite humiliating. It almost made me dread going to my classes.\n\nWould you say that experience damaged you as a child? If yes, how?\n\nIt definitely did ab initio.

For how long were you body-shamed before you realized you could put your height to good use?\n\nYes, they get suicidal because they do not confide in anyone. I think it is mainly because parents do not talk to their children. Height-shaming, part of body-shaming, has not been discussed in our clime.

Any activity I participated in back then, I was always at the back. I used to sit at the back of the classroom just because sitting in the front or the middle row would make my classmates complain about how my head is obstructing their view.

They even went to the extent of calling me by some funny names ( laughs).\n\nDid you criticize your appearance or were you openly criticised in front of other people?\n\nI never criticized my appearance. I think I would say I knew what I got right from time and that it was an asset. But as for being openly criticized by my peers, oh yes, they did.\n\nWould you say that experience damaged you as a child? If yes, how?\n\nNo, it did not.\n\nMany children today get suicidal when bullied because of their appearance. For how long were you body-shamed before you realized you could put your height to good use?\n\nYes, and that\u2019s why we should say no to bullying. When one bullies another person because of their appearance, it affects the person mentally and can result in the person having low self confidence. All these can lead to the person being suicidal.\n\nI wasn\u2019t body-shamed for too long because my elder sisters, back then, used to tell me how I\u2019m going to go to Paris when I\u2019m of age and go into modeling.

          "title": "Evans Akere: Innovating African Traditional Wear",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nSince launching his fashion line, Creative Director and CEO of Vanskere, Evans Akere, has become one of the major brands saddled with the responsibility of making African traditional wear acceptable worldwide.\n\nA lawyer by training, his passion and love for fashion, has made his home-grown brand a premium lifestyle brand for men. Renowned for its obsession with craftsmanship, the basic goal Evans says has always been to make stylish and comfortable clothes, a major factor for the brand\u2019s success so far.\n\nWith a clientele list that boasts of politicians, corporate executives and A-list celebrities, Vanskere continues to bridge the market gap for classic, yet, in-trend occasion wear garments tailored for today\u2019s man. Here, he talks about switching from law to the needle profession, the birth of his latest Afro-Athleisure collection- Signore Fusion by Vanskere, (a collection inspired by the COVID19 lockdown) that is now a brand on its own, challenges in the industry and the Nigeria of his dreams.\n\nYou read law in the university, at what point did you embrace fashion?\n\nThat was when I was studying law. I found out that something was not right. I found it difficult to fit in as a law student because I was too elaborate in my dressing. Back then, as a law student, you had to dress corporate in black and white but I like to express myself in my dressing. I like colours.\n\nI remember when I was in law school during my compulsory court attachments, I was actually walked out of court by a Senior Advocate because of the way I was dressed. I wore a purple shirt and a purple tie to court. The judge wanted to take it up that I will not graduate from Law School. I never practiced law or went to court.\n\nI finally made up my mind to do fashion after my call to the Bar. I did not practice.\n\nHow did the VANSKERE brand come to be and how has the brand evolved over the years?\n\nThe VANSKERE brand came to be as a result of my love for fashion. Although I was trained as a lawyer, my passion for fashion supersedes that of law, which made me abandon law. VANSKERE is an abbreviation of my first and last name. It was my nickname from my teenage days. So when it was time for me to set up, it was only logical that I registered the name as the brand name.\n\nThe brand has evolved over the years from a basic fashion brand, to a Luxury fashion brand, with emphasis on modern African traditional wear.\n\nWhat have been your weirdest sources of inspiration for your brand and design direction?\n\nLike I have always said, inspiration is divine, it\u2019s indescribable, and it comes naturally. For an artist, anything can be a source of inspiration. For me, my weirdest source of inspiration has been from lines, curves, and angles.\n\nThe Vanskere brand is fun, but there is also a classic appeal to your apparel. How do you strike an appropriate balance between classic and contemporary?\n\nIt has been easy striking a balance between classic and contemporary fashion because we understand the brand, its core value, and target market. We know it\u2019s imperative that we maintain and sustain our conservative nature, while also meeting the needs of our fashionable customers.\n\nWhat would you consider the biggest challenge as a fashion entrepreneur?\n\nMy biggest challenge from day one has always been how to manage my tailors. In Nigeria, there is a lack of efficient tailors, the few available ones are either not loyal or are badly behaved.\n\nHow have you managed this problem over the years?\n\nManaging tailors is a big challenge like I said, the majority of them are not loyal. If you are lucky, you might have one or two who are, but majority of them are not. It\u2019s more challenging when you have a big factory with many of them; you\u2019ll need to be strong mentally and physically to survive each day. Even when you have a factory manager, majority of the issues still end up on your table.\n\nTo stay above board, I see it as a business hazard that I have to endure daily. So, I\u2019m prepared and ready to face them when I come to work each day.\n\nYou have worked in the fashion industry for quite some years now, what is the best lesson you have learned along the way?\n\nMy best lesson so far would be never to design clothes that suit only my personal style.\n\nHow would you describe the fashion industry in Nigeria today? What would you say are the challenges and way forward?\n\nThe industry has definitely grown over the years, more Nigerians are beginning to appreciate locally made clothes and this has increased the level of patronage. The majority of Nigerian designers have stepped up their game, creating beautiful designs with impeccable finishing. But, there is still a lot of work to be done for our clothes to get that global recognition like we see in the music and movie industry.\n\nThere are lots of challenges in the industry, one of the major one, is lack of a steady power supply; without electricity we can\u2019t produce. A lot of the money we make is spent on buying generators and maintaining them, funds that should have been ploughed back into the business. We don\u2019t even have the enabling environment for business growth and expansion. Basic infrastructures are not available. We do not have textile industries, everything we use including the fabrics are imported. There are no colleges of fashion, only a few institutions offer fashion designing as a course. I could go on and on, but I think the way forward would be for our government to invest in the industry and create an enabling environment.\n\nThe fashion industry was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. How has the pandemic impacted the Vanskere brand? What was your strategy for staying afloat during the lockdown?\n\nThe pandemic did hit hard on almost every business, but we thank God that the impact wasn\u2019t so hard on the Vanskere brand. We realised that it wasn\u2019t business as usual; we were in an unusual time, so we needed to do the business in an unusual manner. We started off by making face masks for individuals and later scaled up to companies. The sales from the face masks were unbelievable, we couldn\u2019t believe how much we made from it. Then came the easing of lockdown measures; we discovered that most companies were working remotely, while the majority of their staff were working from home. There were no parties and events. Based on this, there was a decline in the purchase of clothes. Then the idea came from our PR team to create comfortable and more casual clothes that could be worn indoors while working and outdoors when socialising. This idea gave birth to the Afro-Athleisure collection under the auspices of our diffusion line \u2013 Signore Fusion by Vanskere. The collection became a huge success and this has become one of our best business decisions in a while. As a result, Signore Fusion is now a brand on its own.\n\nWhat do you love most about what you do?\n\nEverything, I love everything about fashion. I like to study and predict trends; I love to sketch designs and shop for fabrics. I also like to play a major role in the production aspect of the designs.\n\nWhat do you think makes one a successful fashion designer?\n\nI think what makes one a successful fashion designer is the ability to manage change. As a designer, you must have the ability to envisage change, dictate and move with trends.\n\nTell us a bit about your growing up years and what informed your choice of career as a teenager?\n\nI was born in Edo State. I had my primary and secondary education in Benin-City. My Dad was a successful lawyer, so I wanted to be like him, this made me study law at the university. He indirectly influenced me to study Law. As a young boy growing up, there was this tendency to be like him. But along the line, I realised I was destined to be a designer, but that didn\u2019t make me drop out of school. I completed my law programme before pursuing my passion for fashion. I came to Lagos for my Law school programme, after which, I stayed behind to establish the Vanskere brand. A few years later, I felt the need to have a formal education in fashion, so I went to London to study at the London College of fashion.\n\nDescribe a day in the life of Evans Akere\n\nI start my day with prayers, then go to the gym if its my workout day. I go back home to freshen up and have breakfast, after which I get to work. I work long hours so I get home quite late. I usually look forward to going home to my family after a long day at work. My routine is quite seamless \u2013 I wind down by watching some news channels. If I am inspired, I create new designs, if not, it lights out.\n\nMen do not always pay attention to the way they dress. Give some advice on how to be stylish?\n\nMy advice will be to wear clothes that fit. Men should not shy away from bright colours, the era of wearing only dull colours is long gone. Dress for the occasion and keep accessories to a minimum.\n\nWhat are some of your biggest dreams that you are yet to fulfill?\n\nThat would be making Vanskere a complete African fashion and lifestyle brand.\n\nWhat are your hobbies and interests outside work?\n\nI am a huge football fan, I enjoy watching and analyzing the game. I like listening to music. I also like to watch good movies and read books.\n\nWhat is next for Vanskere?\n\nThe next phase is to make the brand more accessible worldwide.\n\nAre you looking to design for ladies in the future?\n\nSure, it is something we are looking into.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you take time out to relax?\n\nI stay indoors and watch good movies and work out. I am what some would term an \u201cintrovert\u201d, but I cherish my time out with my family. I work really hard, so I don\u2019t joke with family vacations. I take out time every year to go on holiday.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nThat would be Dubai. It\u2019s an ideal holiday destination, with luxury hotels, theme parks, and loads of activities.\n\nNigeria will be celebrating her independence anniversary soon, with all that is going on, do you think there\u2019s a reason to celebrate?\n\nI don\u2019t think there is any reason to celebrate, but we have every reason to be grateful. At least, we are not experiencing a civil war, despite the challenges. Nigeria is still better than Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhat is the Nigeria of your dreams?\n\nThe Nigeria of my dreams is a country where you\u2019re free to be the very best and productive that you can be, irrespective of your tribe and religion. A country where hard work is rewarded and people do not steal from each other to get rich. Lastly, a prosperous nation where every Nigerian will live in dignity.",

          "text": "Bishop of Ihiala Diocese of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Prof Israel Okoye has warned that the insistence of the Federal Government to support open grazing may lead to food shortage in Nigeria.\n\nOkoye, a professor of Political Science in Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, before he ascended to the seat of the Bishop, stated this in a presidential charge he read during the second session of the fourth synod of the Diocese of Ihiala on Saturday.\n\nThe former academic, who read a very lenthy charge said the controversy about open grazing in Nigeria had become an unfortunate distraction from some fundamental issues on the economy, education, justice, equity, leadership and others, that needed to be addressed.\n\nHe said: \u201cAlthough cattle rearing are key features of animal husbandry, their politicization and seeming treatment as national obligations have attracted objection and resentment.\n\n\u201cThe assumption that the constitution confers on cattle the right of movement along Nigerian roads and communities is untrue. Another errornous stance is that cattle rearing is supported by the federal government, such that herders must be allowed to traverse any part of the country with their cattle as a guarantee for peace.\n\n\u201cArmed cattle herders now migrate with their cattle to any place of their choice, occupy forests without the concsent of the government in charge, to graze their cattle in people\u2019s farms, where they kill, maim and rape women with impunity.\n\n\u201cThe widely held feet-dragging of the federal government in arresting the fast spreading dastardly acts of the armed Fulani herdsmen engendered ill feelings among the affected populations.\u201d\n\nOkoye said if this continued, it would hinder Nigerian farmers from being productive and lead to food shortage, while lamenting that the activities of the Fulani herdsmen have totally corrupted the image of the Fulani people.\n\n\u201cToday, farmers in many parts of Nigeria can no longer go to farm. If these continues, we run the risk of food shortage in Nigeria, which may lead to starvation.\u201d\n\nHe urged the federal government to quickly rise and tackle the menace, and also assure rural dwellers in all parts of the country that their safety also matter, just as those of the Fulani.\n\nOkoye also charged the 7 Southern governors to stick to their promise of ensuring the passage of the anti-open grazing law, reminding them that as chief security officers of their respective states, they owed their people the duty of protecting them at all times.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission\u2019s (NCC) plan for Fifth Generation (5G) technology deployment in the country continues to gather momentum with the Commission confirming that its readiness to begin full implementation is at 97 per cent.\n\nThe Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, reaffirmed the status of the Commission\u2019s 5G technology deployment at the annual African Tech Alliance Forum (AfriTech 2021) held in Lagos on Wednesday, October 13, 2021 with the overarching theme: \u201cEmbracing Changes and Digital Transformation in the New Normal.\u201d\n\nFocusing his presentation on \u201cNCC as a Digital Transformation Crusader and Nigeria\u2019s in-Road to 5G Deployment,\u201d Danbatta stated that, following the advent of COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a change in the dynamics of people\u2019s interaction, especially on the Internet. According to him, almost every means of communication has become virtual in one way or the other.\n\nDanbatta, however, stated that this paradigm shift in communication has led to significant increase in network connectivity requirements as a result of unprecedented upsurge in Internet traffic, occasioned by the use of a plethora of web applications such as Zoom, Microsoft teams, WebEx, Goto, Webner and so on. He said this has made remote work, virtual meetings, virtual studies and virtual healthcare delivery, among others, the new normal.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, even though, the network infrastructure in Nigeria has demonstrated some capacity to contain the surge in internet traffic, a lot of work is being done by the Commission to boost network capacity, sensitise the public and ensure accessibility to affordable connectivity during the period of the pandemic and beyond.\n\nDue to the network traffic demand, the EVC said the NCC is working with operators to implement a number of initiatives to ensure network expansion. These, he said, include ongoing plan to auction spectrum in 3.5 gigahertz (Ghz) band to operators for the deployment of 5G network in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cConsistent with our mandate as enshrined in the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 (NCA-2003) and other guiding legislations, we have been working to ensure the penetration of broadband services in line with Federal Government\u2019s targets, as contained in Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020 to 2025.\n\n\u201cAlready, we are set for the auction some spectrum slots in 3.5GHz band. The other day I was at the National assembly, I informed the senate that we were 95 per cent ready for 5G. Today as we speak, I am delighted to tell you that we are already at 97 per cent completion,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\n\u201cThe Committee set up to auction the Spectrum has already developed and Information Memorandum (IM) which is already published for inputs and comments from all industry stakeholders. Prior to this, a 5G deployment plan was developed and we have since secured Federal Government\u2019s approval,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said this is in addition to a lot of other initiatives being put in place by the Commission to improve broadband connectivity in Nigeria, adding that the surge in Internet traffic induced by Covid-19 has continued to challenge National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and other arms of governments to ensure deployment of adequate resources such as spectrum and other forms of support to increase network resilience and accessibility to telecommunication services.\n\n\u201cEmerging technologies such as 5G, which NCC is driving aggressively in Nigeria, Internet of Things (IoT); Cloud Computing; Quantum Computing Augmented/Virtual Reality, and similar emerging technologies are playing a critical role in improving remote communication over the internet with great user experience. The NCC is committed to promoting this inevitable change and enhance user experience through effective regulation of the telecoms sector,\u201d the EVC said.\n\nThe EVC was represented at the event by Engr. Oluwatoyin Asaju, Director, Spectrum Administration. Also in attendance was The Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde.\n\nOther key industry stakeholders participated at the one-day Forum, which also featured exhibition by some sector players.",

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa\n\nCall it the mother of all social events, you are certainly not wrong. Saturday, October 16, would remain a memorable day in the history of media events in Nigeria, The Sun Publishing Limited held its 18th edition of the annual The Sun Awards.\n\nThe ceremony is indisputably adjudged the biggest media event in Nigeria.\n\nOn this edition, the leading media house honoured 24 outstanding Nigerians, for remarkably distinguishing themselves in their various fields of endeavours even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged the world in 2020.\n\nThough the red carpet was billed to kick off at 5:00p.m, guests from across Nigeria and beyond started coming in trickles into the Eko Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, the venue of the prestigious ceremony.\n\nThe tables for 10 and chairs were skillfully arranged and decorated in red and white. They all radiated beauty, panache, fun and elegance. Many would easily acknowledge that each table was alluringly tempting and inviting.\n\nFrom noon, roads to Victoria Island, Lagos were busier than usual as guests poured into the premises of Eko Hotels & Suites, the venue of the prestigious ceremony. From across the length and breadth of Nigeria, even beyond, dignitaries emptied into the venue.\n\nThe exotics cars, Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) that occupied all the parking lots of the hotel were a loud statement that something unusual was happening in Lagos.\n\nFrom trickles, it became a huge crowd just before 5:30p.m. It took the frantic and extraordinary efforts of the broad-chested bouncers mounting the entrance to the venue to maintain a relative level of decorum.\n\nNo doubt, the event was a classic one by all definitions. It exuded finesse, glitz and glamour. Guests, who were elegantly dressed in various attires and looking splendid, were carefully ushered into the elaborate hall.\n\nThe illumination that intermittently filled the stage marvelled all. A look up to the roof dazzled one with lights like a galaxy of stars; it was a beauty to behold. The stage was just on fire, radiating everything about the beauty of The Sun as the \u201cVoice of the Nation.\u201d\n\nAt exactly 7:44p.m, the night of recognition of excellence was properly kick-started with the country\u2019s national anthem. The master of ceremony (MC), an iconic on-air personality, actor and comedian, Gbenga Adeyinka, set the stage rolling.\n\nIt was a night that The Sun shone on brightly on the awardees for displaying excellence even when it was most inconvenient.\n\nThe cream of the Nigerian society, including top politicians, economic titans, media bigwigs, traditional rulers, and entertainers as well as other distinguished people from all walks of life, filled the expansive hall. Indeed, the calibre of the personalities and guests in attendance redefined the annual show and elevated the event above the usual social gala.\n\nGovernors, state and federal legislators, politicians across parties, captains of industry, business moguls, and academics, among others, were in attendance.\n\nThose who have been keenly following the annual awards said that the choice of the magnificent hall suggests the size and stature of the event, which they acknowledged has continued to be improved upon with every passing edition. The crowd was huge.\n\nSetting the tone of the event was the Managing Director/ Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Mr Onuoha Ukeh, who said that the gathering was that of celebration.\n\nHe said that the awardees were Nigerians who excelled when success appeared impossible. He added that the 24 award winners were made of sterner stuff.\n\n\u201cWe are not exaggerating. They are resourceful, dogged, resilient, strategic and focused. They could pass for conquerors of COVID-19, having excelled in their respective endeavours at such difficult time,\u201d Ukeh said.\n\nThe chairman of the occasion, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, who was represented by the Minister of Sports and Youths Development, Sunday Dare, described the award ceremony as getting better every year.\n\nThe night was not only restricted to speeches, handing out awards and honours to those who deserved them. There was equally a lot of fun that will remain indelible with those who attended.\n\nWhile the seated guests were waiting for the event to officially begin, the Shuga Band crew sang their hearts out. Singing soul-lifting songs with uncommon passion and exactness, the band members set the award winners and guests in the right mood, making it an evening to remember for a very long time.\n\nOne of Africa\u2019s finest musicians, Kingsley Chinweike Okonkwo popularly known as Kcee, didn\u2019t disappoint the audience as he dished out scintillating tunes that kept the audience cheering.\n\nResponding spontaneously to the indescribable energy, speed and accuracy of the music icon, the audience couldn\u2019t resist jumping to their feet to turn every space in the hall to a dance floor.\n\nThose honoured with various awards are: Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Mallam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (Man of the Year); Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State (Governor of the Year); Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State (Political Icon); and Comrade Philip Shaibu, Deputy Governor of Edo State (Sports Personality).\n\nOther winners are Chief (Mrs) Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, First Lady, Ondo State (Most Supportive First Lady); Allen Onyema, chairman, Air Peace and Dr. Adedeji Adeleke (Exceptional Philanthropist); Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), chairman, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency; Brig-Gen Shuaibu Ibrahim, Director General, National Yours Service Corps (NYSC) and Speaker, Abia State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Chinedum Orji (Public Service); Engr.

Babagana Kingibe, former SGF (Lifetime Achievement); Chief Frank Okafor, chairman of Marco Polo Group Limited and Prince Chris Igwe, chairman, Mainland Oil Limited (Investor of the Year).\n\nThough the event might have come and gone, with the fun and excitement of the 2021 The Sun Awards, will continue to linger till the next ceremony next year.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Sunday Ani and Chinelo Obogo\n\nThe Sun Man of the Year and Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has reiterated the reason driving the infrastructural development stride of his administration, saying that at the core of the effort is the desire to ensure that he bequeaths a legacy to the present and future generations.\n\nGovernor Wike who was represented the Deputy Governor of the state, Mrs. Ipalibo Banigo, thanked the Sun Newspapers for the honour done to him.\n\nReceiving the award on his behalf, Mrs Banigo said the Wike administration had continued to vigorously pursue the new Rivers State vision, touching on every aspect of the state for the present and future generations.\n\nDaughter of the Publisher of the Sun Newspapers, Neya Orji Kalu, in her opening remarks urged the Sun Awards winners to remain consistent in their individual endeavours.\n\nNeya Kalu, who represented her father, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, commended the awardees for being singled out among millions of Nigerians for the award, saying it was a great feat.\n\nNoting that they deserved the award, she reminded them that \u201cto whom much is given, much is expected, and urged them to work together and live in peace for the progress of the country.\n\nShe regretted that the award could not hold last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged the world and brought economic hardship to many countries of the world, including Nigeria.\n\nShe paid tribute to all the frontline workers in the fight to contain Coronavirus, even as she called on all to remember those that were lost to the pandemic as well as those that were lost to the senseless killings in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking in similar tone, Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shuaibu, who got the Sports Personality of the Year award, dedicated it to Governor Godwin Obaseki, who was physically present to support and felicitate with him, saying he created an enabling environment for him to thrive and excel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful to Governor Godwin Obaseki for the opportunity he gave me to serve and if he didn\u2019t entrust the sports sector to me, this would not have happened. He gave me the wings to fly and I am very grateful to him for it. This is a reason for me to work harder and I do not take it for granted. For us in Edo, we do not complain, we only proffer solutions and that is why things are working well the way they are,\u201d Shuaibu said.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, while receiving the Exceptional Philanthropist of the Year award urged the Federal Government to grant amnesty to Sunday Igboho, the Yoruba separatist leader and Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nHe said he believes in the unity of Nigeria and also believes that with dialogue, the issues that have given rise to insecurity in the country can be resolved. He said if amnesty could work in the case of Niger Delta militants, it could also be used for the separatist leaders.\n\nThe First Lady of Ondo State, Betty Akeredolu, who was given the Most Supportive First Lady award for her advocacy against breast cancer and the many projects she has embarked on to help women in the state, expressed her gratitude to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu for his support and thanked The Sun for the award.\n\n\u201cThank you for finding me worthy of this award among all the first ladies. What we do is a lot of work to make sure that we make this world a better place than we found it. This work is not just me alone, I have a team that spurred me on. For those that follow me in doing what I have done, I want to say thank you and to also appreciate my husband because without him giving me space, I don\u2019t think I would be here. We have made sure that vulnerable women are taken care of in Ondo State even during COVID-19 and today we have an organisation that supports widows and anyone who wants to help us can go to the website and contribute,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Sun Entrepreneur of the Year award winner, Nnamdi Ezeigbo, in his response, expressed gratitude to The Sun Management for the recognition. He said: \u201cI feel so honoured.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nAmid uncertainty over the zoning of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential ticket, governors elected on the platform of the party and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar are now neck-deep in an epic tussle over the control of the structure of the opposition party.\n\nApart from Atiku, others involved in the battle for the soul of the PDP ahead of the 2023 general elections include former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. All the gladiators have their eyes on the 2023 PDP presidential ticket.\n\nAtiku, Saraki, Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto State governor), Ifeanyi Okowa ( Delta State governor), Nyesom Wike (Rivers State governor) and Bala Mohammed (Bauchi State governor), respectively are touted to be interested in the 2023 PDP presidential ticket.\n\nTherefore, for the presidential hopeful, the PDP October 30-31 is first step to determine who will gain the upper hand in the contest.\n\nThe PDP Governors Forum smarting from the face-off between suspended party National Chairman, Uche Secondus and some members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) had taken charge of the opposition party to the chagrin of some stakeholders.\n\nHowever, the governors have continued to call the shots in the opposition party.\n\nThe recent zoning formula for party offices was a fallout of the meeting of the PDP Governors Forum held in September. The governors during the meeting had voted for the chairmanship of the party to be zoned to the North.\n\nThe following day, the PDP Zoning Committee headed by Enugu State governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, zoned the national chairmanship position of the party to the North, as well as recommended a swap of party offices currently been occupied by the South and the North.\n\nIn the aftermath of the zoning, Atiku and Saraki vehemently protested the zoning of the chairmanship to the North, which they considered inimical to their presidential ambition.\n\nAfter the PDP NEC ratified the recommendation of the Ugwuanyi panel, both men worked assiduously to ensure that the national chairman does not come from their respective geo-political zones. Atiku and Saraki hail from the Northeast and North-central respectively..\n\nBaraje Kawu, Saraki\u2019s ally and former PDP chairman, had in a statement said that what the North wants is the presidential ticket and not the chairmanship position.\n\nHowever, the northern PDP leaders, after series of meeting adopted former Senate President, Iyorchia Ayu, as the North\u2019s consensus candidate for the chairmanship position. The former Senate President had earlier been adopted as the consensus candidate of the North-central for the top party job.\n\nAnalyst say the emergence of Ayu has left Saraki with the short end of the stick, and apparently strengthened Atiku\u2019s hand in the battle of supremacy in the opposition party. Ayu, a member of the defunct Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) is an ally of the former vice president, Atiku.\n\nIn the Southwest, PDP leaders are on warpath over the distribution of party offices micro-zoned to the region. On one hand, in the tussle for supremacy is the Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde and on the other is a group of party leaders consisting of former Ekiti State governor, Ayo Fayose; Senator Ademola Adeleke and Hon. Ladi Adebutu, former PDP governorship candidate in Osun and Ogun states respectively as well as Chief Deji Derhorty from Lagos State.\n\nA source told Sunday Sun that Makinde wants former governor of Osun State to become the next deputy national chairman (South), but the Fayose group are routing for former PDP National Secretary, Wale Oladipo for the coveted position.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthey are quarrelling. What the governor has done is that he has given publicity secretary to Ogun, with Segun Sowunmi; from what the governor had done, deputy national chairman is going to Osun Oyinlola. Makinde is looking for a way to placate Oyinlola over the national chairman issue\n\n\u201cThey are saying the deputy national secretary will go to Ondo. But it is not clear who the governor is proposing.\n\n\u201cBut Fayose, Ekiti; Adebutu, Ogun; Adeleke, Osun; and Deji Doherty, Lagos; they are not accepting. Instead, they are pushing for Wale Oladipo to become the next deputy national chairman.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the PDP Governors Forum is pushing for the Director General of the forum, CID Maduabum, to become the next national secretary.\n\nThe national secretary, as well as the national auditor are the two positions tentatively micro-zoned to the Southeast. However, some party leaders in the zone are working to scuttle the emergence of Maduabum.\n\n\u201cThe governors said they want Maduabum as national secretary. But some persons are objecting.That is where we are,\u201d the source said.\n\nUncertainty over zoning of presidential ticket\n\nRegardless, with the national chairmanship position seemingly settled, attention has now shifted to the zoning of the presidential ticket.\n\nOrdinarily, with the PDP chairmanship position going to the North, the presidential candidate should automatically come from the South.\n\nHowever, party leaders are singing a different tune. Several party chieftains, especially those from the North, want the ticket to be thrown open to all qualified persons.\n\nAtiku, in his speech, at the 94th NEC of the party, penultimate Thursday, had said that the party should be guided by justice, fairness and how to regain in deciding its next presidential candidate.\n\nHe noted that zoning is neither the problem nor solution to the problems of the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Peoples Democratic Party has the right to determine its rules on how the party should be governed. The people of Nigeria also have the right to determine who governs them.\n\n\u201cWhere the president comes from has never been the problem of Nigeria neither will it be the solution. There is no such thing as a president of Southern Nigeria, or a president of Northern Nigeria. There is only one president from Nigeria, for Nigeria, by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAnd Atiku seems not to be the only one that shares this sentiment.\n\nFormer governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni told Sunday Sun that the major concern of the PDP should be how to win the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nAccording to Oni, an opposition party does not have the luxury of determining where his presidential candidate would come from.\n\nThe former governor said: \u201cA party that is not in power, does not have the luxury of saying this is where I want my candidate to come from.They should be more interested in how they are going to get into power, because it is not a routine civil service matter \u2013 do it this way, conduct it this away, no.\n\n\u201cThis is a tussle for power and you must adopt your best opportunities. So, I believe that when the time comes, the party will examine every possibilities. And whatever will bring us back to power in 2023 that is what we will go for. That should be my own advice.\u201d\n\nAlso, former Minister of Transport, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, said that one cannot decide for the party where it will zone its presidential ticket, advising, however, that the PDP ensures there is justice in choosing its 2023 presidential standard bearer.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cour party, the PDP, should do everything to ensure that the person we put forward to contest election is the person who can win election. And by the grace of God, we are going to be guided by God and we will have victory. I want to advise the party to ensure that justice is done and the person selected would be the person that will represent the best interest of the party and the country.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, former PDP Deputy National Secretary, Dave Iorhemba told Sunday Sun that it would be wrong to ask anyone not to vie for the presidential ticket of the opposition party in 2023, because of where he or she comes from.\n\nIorhemba said that to do so would amount to an infringement of the person\u2019s right.\n\nHe said that \u201cyou cannot take the political party arrangements to infringe on people constitutional right. This ( presidential primary) is a free election, any person can vie for it, irrespective that the party chairmanship is zoned to any zone. The people of that zone, it is their constitutional rights, you can\u2019t infringe on it.\u201d\n\nRecall that the PDP 2019 Election Review Committee headed by the Bauchi governor, Bala Mohammed, had recommended that the presidential primary be thrown open to all interested aspirants.\n\nHowever, the opposition party is yet to take a decision on the report, which was submitted in March.\n\nIn fact, the PDP NEC only opened discussions on the Bala Mohammed Committee report on penultimate Thursday in the heat of protest over the zoning of the chairmanship position to the North.\n\nThe PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said that the party would take a decision on the zoning of the presidential ticket in subsequent NEC meetings.\n\nNevertheless, Sunday Sun gathered that the PDP may eventually throw the presidential primary open to all interested aspirants.\n\nAnd in the event that a northerner clinches the ticket, the party will re-zone party offices to accommodate the South.\n\nA reliable source in the party told Sunday Sun that the unofficial position of the PDP leaders is that the North will produce the 2023 presidential candidate so as to brighten the chances of the opposition party in the election.\n\nHe noted that the PDP Southern governors, who voted for the North to produce the next chairman, apparently did so because of the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum that the next president should be a southerner.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zoning of the chairmanship to the North is just a game. Everyone knows that the unofficial position of the party is that the presidential ticket will be given to the North. The Southern governors, who voted for the chairmanship to go to the North were just playing to the gallery. They probably did that to be seen as keeping with the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum that the next president should come from the South.\n\n\u201cWhat is likely to happen is that the presidential primary will be thrown open and a northerner will emerge. The calculation is that if the PDP wins the 2023 presidential election, the national chairman will step down and and there would be another convention where a southern will be elected as chairman.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nAmidst the hue and cry over the zoning of the 2023 presidency, a former Governor of Rivers State, Sir Celestine Omehia, has said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will make its position known in no distant time.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, Omehia declared that the chances of the PDP displacing the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023 is realizable.\n\nAmongst other issues, Omehia opened up on the rumoured planned defection of former President Goodluck Jonathan to the APC, the insecurity bedeviling the country, his relationship with his successor and current Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike. Excerpt:\n\nIn 2007, you tried to become governor of Rivers State, you got in and after few months, court scuttled your efforts for Rotimi Amaechi. Those issues that made you to vie for governor, have they been addressed by Amaechi and Governor Nyesom Wike?\n\nIssues in administration of governance depend on the leadership of the government. They could be issues conceived before vying for the position or issues arising from the circumstance of the administration and also issues that your team members are meant to implement or determine. Before I was elected as governor, I had conceived ideas for the urgent and very important needs of the people of Rivers State. This was because of my close relationship with my predecessor and mentor, Dr. Peter Odili. Therefore, when I was elected to succeed him, I had to put the ideas and issues into the administration and hit the ground running. In a similar way, the current administration of Chief Nyesom Ezenwo Wike is implementing his good plans for the development and growth of Rivers State, particularly for the economic and political wellbeing of the people of the state. I must unequivocally say that Nyesom Wike is an excellent administrator and a politician who implements the needs of the people of Rivers State as a whole.\n\nDo you have any regret not completing your tenure as governor of Rivers State?\n\nNo, no, no, I do not have any regrets for not completing my tenure because God Almighty who is all-knowing has reasons for pulling me out at the time he did. Though, I had good ideas and plans for the development of the state encapsulated in my five-point agenda with the acronym \u201cSHIRE\u201d contract. This simply means: Social Contract; Human development and Quality of Life Agenda; Infrastructural Development Agenda; Rural and Agricultural Development Agenda; and Economic Empowerment and Poverty Reduction Agenda. All these would have made a whole lot of difference, but no regrets. The administration of Chief Nyesom Wike has done better and greater things for the people of Rivers State. I have said I have no regrets on how my tenure ended and I am eternally grateful to God and the good people of Rivers State who gave me that opportunity to serve. I have received countless awards for that short period of service and would rather prefer to continue to thank God for that opportunity.\n\nWhat is your relationship with Amaechi and Wike?\n\nOh yes, I have a perfect relationship with Governor Nyesom Wike as a person and an excellent relationship with the administration which he heads. We relate as friends, brothers and political associates. In all honesty, I have learnt a lot of political ideas from him and vice versa. Nyesom is a born politician. Rotimi Amaechi is my younger brother and we relate as brothers in our family, but obviously we disagree politically and have different political ideology.\n\nHow would you compare the eight years of Amaechi and the over six years of Wike in Rivers State?\n\nI was not in Rivers State during the administration of Rotimi Amaechi, so I cannot perfectly talk of his administration. But I can say that the present administration of Nyesom Wike is excellent in all ramifications and Dr. Peter Odili has said that \u201cNyesom has done better.\u201d\n\nWe understand that you are the one frustrating reconciliation with Amaechi. Is it true?\n\nNo, no, no, you are not correct. Amaechi and I have only met once in the past 15 years. This was during the burial of our elder brother, Charles in Ubima in 2020. I believe that there is time for everything. It is not yet Uhuru.\n\nThe politics of Rivers State: PDP has been able to hold sway because of the political stature of Wike even when the state was a battle ground during the 2015 and 2019 elections. Now that Wike is leaving, do you think Rivers State will not fall to other parties, particularly the APC?\n\nPDP has always held sway in Rivers State since its inception. The administration of Rivers State has always been in the portfolio of PDP. I must say without fear of contradiction that PDP has always delivered the dividends of democracy in Rivers State. The people of Rivers State have always resisted the intrusion by other parties even when soldiers and other military personnel were deployed to thwart the people\u2019s mandate in 2019. This is always so because PDP has always presented the best candidate and the candidates have always performed in their social contract with the people of the state. As a former governor and experienced politician, I can testify that the Nyesom Wike administration has done excellently well. His performance will definitely be an edge and an added advantage in the favour of PDP in the next election of 2023. His records in infrastructural development, security, urban and rural development, human resources development, including his political prowess, is an advantage which no other party can afford. This will be only for the benefit of PDP in Rivers State. In any case, there is no serious party in Rivers State that can rival PDP. APC is at the verge of extinction in Rivers State since all her members have willingly and joyfully joined PDP. We are waiting to receive the two major leaders of the two factions in Rivers State. Therefore, 2023 election will see PDP as the winning party in Rivers.\n\nThe tussle in the PDP regarding the presidency and the chairmanship of the party which we have seen where it is going; people have said the presidency should go to the South, particularly, the Southeast and now, we are seeing the North showing interest. What is your opinion? And what is the position of PDP on zoning?\n\nTalking about zoning in PDP, it is a constitutional matter. We also know that a zoning committee was set up and a zoning arrangement was concluded except the presidency or the offices of the legislative houses. The zoning of the National Working Committee was successfully concluded and the National Executive Committee of the party has accepted the report and the zones are already implementing the NEC directive. We shall soon take a decision on the zoning of the presidency. These are the internal affairs of the party. It is a gradual process and we are progressing. The steps taken so far are further uniting the party and breeding peace and understanding within PDP. As usual, PDP leads the way in political arrangements and others follow.\n\nThe ability of the PDP coming to the centre again after losing power to APC in 2015, is it something that is realizable?\n\nOf course, yes. I must say absolute yes. Nigerians have realized the falsehood with which APC used in getting their votes. Democracy cannot triumph on falsehood. Therefore, APC has lost the confidence of reasonable Nigerians. PDP is the only hope of Nigerians for the return of democracy and the benefit therein. The implosion of APC is another factor that will keep the party permanently disunited. Selfish and egoistic interest will not allow unity in APC. So, both internally and externally, APC can no longer stand as a party. God is with us in PDP, which is why you can see the bad eggs who could not withstand the political strength of the good people in the party have left to join their colleagues in APC. \u201cBirds of same plumage flock together.\u201d I can say here and now that PDP will lead Nigeria and Nigerians to political, economic and democratic freedom in 2023.\n\nThere are rumours that former President Goodluck Jonathan will likely go to the APC to contest for the presidency. Will this not jeopardise the chances of PDP?\n\nAbout former President Goodluck Jonathan joining APC remains a rumour. He has not come out to tell the world that he is leaving PDP. My last check, the former president is still a bonafide member of PDP. He must be accorded his due respect. We should credit him with the intelligence that he will not destroy the reputation and the international image he has built in the years past as a leader and mentor in PDP. As a General in the Army, he cannot pick his gun and fire against the soldiers he is leading to war.\n\nInsecurity is escalating every day across the country. Are you not bothered that this can hamper elections in 2023?\n\nYes, insecurity is the bane in Nigeria today. It looks like Nigeria is in a state of war; from East to the West, from North to the South, nowhere is secure. This is the result of maladministration in Nigeria. I believe that these people will put down their arms of war during the election in 2023 to push out APC who is their major enemy in government.\n\nWhat method did you deploy to tackle insecurity during your stint in Rivers State that you think the Federal Government can emulate?\n\nYou mean the method we applied as government of Rivers State? We applied the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d method where we set up a Peace and Rehabilitation Committee who talked with the cult groups and made them appreciate the need to embrace peace and unite with the people of Rivers State. This method snowballed into the establishment of the Presidential Peace and Conflict Resolution Committee for the Niger Delta, a mirror version of the State Committee under the chairmanship of the late Senator David Brigidi. This committee later concluded its work and was replaced with the Presidential Amnesty Programme under the Office the Vice President with Senator Heineken Lokpobiri as secretary. This method brought in the needed peace and economic growth in Rivers State, Niger Delta and Nigeria as a whole. My conclusion is that, there should be a peaceful approach in every warring situation for Nigeria to have all other benefits.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "In a Dramatic Shift, Kingibe Says Nigeria\u2019s Unity Negotiable",
          "text": "\u2022Tambuwal: We need a detribalised leader\n\nFestus Akanbi and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nContrary to the claims by many Nigerian leaders that the unity of the country is non-negotiable, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, has declared that the unity of Nigeria is negotiable.\n\nGovernor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has however stated that what the country needs at this moment is a detribalised leader with a large heart to accommodate the diverse interests of the people.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at The Sun Newspaper Awards for 2020 held in Lagos, Kingibe however said even the union between a husband and wife is negotiable.\n\nThe accomplished diplomat further stated that any part of Nigeria that wants to pull out of the country should be advised to think about the implications of leaving Nigeria and what will happen to its landmass.\n\nHe reminded separatist agitators that the land they reside would not be carved out and taken to anywhere in the event of their leaving Nigeria, pointing out that the land would remain where it is.\n\nKingibe, who received the newspaper\u2019s \u2018Lifetime Achievement Award,\u2019 called on Nigerians to learn to respect one another.\n\nHe pointed out that he recorded all his achievements as a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cI was born in Nigeria. I was groomed in Nigeria. I believe in Nigeria. People of my generation believe in Nigeria. We have no doubt about the fact that we have no option, but Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, I think that a few of my colleagues believe that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable. Of course, it is negotiable. Even the unity of a family is negotiable. Even the constitution of husband and wife is negotiable. The moment either parties feels this union is no longer bearable, that he or she will rather go his/her way. You help them to sit down consider their condition after a careful and rational examination of the pros and cons of how to be married that they take the decision which suit them best.\n\n\u201cIt is enough just to say I do not farewell where I am. So, I am going,\u201d Kingibe explained.\n\nHe, however, added that any party that wants to pull out from the union should consider the implications.\n\n\u201cAre you sure where you are going? Are you sure of the consequence of where you are going? Do you really feel that the grass is greener on the other side? If you do, sit with your partner in respect, in mutual respect, in love if possible, but without demonising your husband or your wife because you will always remain the ex of the other person. But discuss quietly so that even if you separate in the future you can inter-relate with love and respect,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking specifically on the issue of those agitating to leave the country, Kingibe said: \u201cWhen we ever say we want to go away, I do not think they realise the going away. It is not that you carve out the piece of land, take it up and put it in other side of Ghana. The piece of land will be here. You will be here. Everybody will be here. And we all want to prosper. My appeal to everyone is, please, let us be respectful of one another. Let us not demonise one another. Let us respect the views of everybody,\u201d he noted.\n\nKingibe hailed a former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for creating a platform that would enable this dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe awardees are from everywhere. I listened carefully to the remarks made by the awardees before me. Two of them from the South-east ended their remarks by saying, I \u2018believe in one Nigeria.\u2019 I presume, it is a reflection of the fact that they achieved whatever they did because they are Nigerians. We can all achieve our goals in Nigeria. We are only part of a greater entity, be it ECOWAS. ECOWAS is one part of a greater entity called Africa and Africa exists in a globalised world.\n\n\u201cWherever you go, you will remain a Nigeria, an ECOWAS citizen, an African citizen or a global citizen. So, please, let us mind our language as we address national issues. Whatever I achieved, I stood on the shoulders of great people, many of whom have deserted us, but without them, I cannot be what I am today,\u201d Kingibe explained.\n\nTambuwal: We Need a Detribalised Leader\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Tambuwal of Sokoto State has stated that what Nigeria needs at this moment is a detribalised leader with a large heart to accommodate the diverse interests of the people.\n\nTambuwal stated this when the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Ayokunle Samson Olasupo, paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House in Sokoto.\n\nIn a statement by Tambuwal\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Muhammad Bello, the governor argued that no one or group of people, no matter their religious affiliation or tribe can arrogate the leadership of Nigeria to themselves to the exclusion of other parts of the country.\n\nTambuwal noted that the leadership of the country is mutually complementary, adding that Nigeria belongs to every Nigerian and that no one will send anyone out of the country hence the need to remain together for the betterment of the country.\n\nThe Sokoto State governor insisted that the kind of leadership the country needs will understand the issues of diversities and is inclusive in his approach to governance, without tribal or religious sentiments.\n\nPointing out that both Islam and Christianity have been coexisting even before the union of the country came into existence, Tambuwal also added: \u201cthose who know history said Christianity and Islam belong to the same root,\u201d stressing that \u201cJerusalem and Damascus\u201d were examples of places where the two religions are being practised side by side.\n\n\u201dThere is need for us to continue practising the teaching of the two religions as ordained by God,\u201d he said, emphasising that \u201cif we go by the real teachings of the two religions, there wouldn\u2019t be friction or any reason to fight one another.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and the CAN President for their efforts in preaching peace and unity in the country, stressing that Sokoto State is home to every Nigerian, irrespective of religious, tribal, or ethnic differences.\n\nHe explained that in pursuance of this objective of unity, children of other Nigerians resident in the state who attend public schools are exempted from paying fees just as the indigenes of the state enjoy free education.\n\nTambuwal also added that in the area of health too, the state government\u2019s Zakkat and Waqaf Commission pays the medical bills of indigent Nigerians resident in the stateside by side those of the less-privileged state indigenes.\n\nIn his remarks, the CAN President, Olasupo said he was in the state to interact with the Sultanate, the government, and the people of Sokoto State to find ways to overcome the security challenges being faced in the country.\n\nCalling on Muslims and Christians to live in harmony, Olasupo condoled the people of the state over the loss of lives occasioned by the unfortunate incident of bandits\u2019 attacks in some communities of the state.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the state government for its giant stride in providing security in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Scores injured as gunmen attack congress venues in Ogun, Osun\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu, Ambode, Akpabio, Udoedehe\u2019s loyalists hold parallel congresses \u2022Keyamo, Ogboru, Okorocha, Ararume boycott exercise in Delta, Imo\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe state congresses held across the country yesterday by the All Progressives Congress (APC) were characterised by crisis and formation of parallel state executives of the party in several states, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nSome of the affected states include Lagos, Ogun, Enugu, Kwara, Imo, Sokoto, Kano, Niger, Osun, Delta, Abia, and Rivers.\n\nIn Ogun State, gunmen numbering about 10 invaded the Ake Palace Ground, Abeokuta, the state capital, which was the venue of the State Congress of a faction of the party loyal to the former governor of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nThough, the Chairman of the Congress Committee, Hon. Wale Ohu, had warned that only the result of the Congress held at the MKO Abiola Stadium would be recognised, a faction loyal to Amosun, organised a parallel exercise at the palace.\n\nThe Ministers of Mines and Steel Development, Olamilekan Adegbite; the Senator representing Ogun West Senatorial District, Tolu Odebiyi and the governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement, (APM) in the 2019 election in the state, Adekunle Akinlade were among the dignitaries that fled for their dear lives, when the gunmen struck.\n\nThe trio however escaped unhurt but many others were unlucky as they sustained different degrees of injuries.\n\nSeveral vehicles parked in front of the Palace were destroyed.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that supporters of the faction later regrouped and held the congress.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, the loyalists of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio conducted their congress at the Kara Event Centre along Stadium Road, while the Senator Akpan John Udoedehe-led group elected its officials at Sheer Grace Centre, Uyo the state capital.\n\nSpeaking during the congress held at Kara Event Centre, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, said, however, that the different congresses were working for the interest of the party.\n\nAkpabio, in his remarks, called on the party faithful not to look at the disagreement among the leaders of the party, assuring that such disagreements would be settled at a roundtable.\n\nIn Kwara State, the faction loyal to the state governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has unanimously affirmed the former chairman of PDP and now a chieftain of APC, Chief Sunday Fagbemi as its state chairman of the party.\n\nThe loyalists of Information and Culture Minister, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, re-elected Hon. Bashir Omolaja Bolarinwa as its factional state chairman.\n\nThe APC in Osun State also held parallel congresses in the state.\n\nTwo members of the party were shot by thugs believed to be loyal to one of the factions.\n\nA faction of the APC, The Osun Progressives (TOP), which is loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, held a parallel congress at Ogo Oluwa, Osogbo, while the Ileri Oluwa faction backed by Governor Gboyega Oyetola, also held another state Congress at the stadium.\n\nHoodlums were said to have invaded the TOP factional congress with about eight vehicles and started shooting from the main road.\n\nBut operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) engaged the hoodlums in a gun duel.\n\nHowever, the gunmen shot two members of the APC, Adedolapo Atobatele and Ismail Akinyede.\n\nThe state chairman, the National Congress Committee of the party, Mr. Gbenga Elegbeleye, supervised the congress conducted by the Oyetola faction.\n\nThe Ilerioluwa Group held its congress at the Osogbo City Stadium, where Mr. Gboyega Famodun was re-elected as the state Chairman of the party.\n\nAlhaji Tajudeen Lawal was elected the Deputy Chairman, while Mr. Alao Olabisi was elected the Secretary.\n\nIn his remarks, Oyetola commended the congress committee for conducting a transparent and successful exercise.\n\nMeanwhile, members of TOP, at their parallel congress held at Onward area in Osogbo, elected the immediate past Secretary of the party, Alhaji Rasaq Salinsile, as its new Chairman.\n\nAlso, a former Commissioner for Information in the state, Mr. Adelani Baderinwa, was elected the Secretary of the party.\n\nIn Lagos State, the APC held three parallel congresses across the state.\n\nAt the main congress of the APC held at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Ground, Onikan which witnessed the presence of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mr. Cornelius Ojelabi emerged as the consensus chairman of the APC in the state.\n\nThe congress saw 35 other executive members elected through voice votes.\n\nThe election was conducted by the Chairman of Lagos APC Congress Committee, Mr. Bayo Adelabu.\n\nOfficials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) led by Sheu AbdulWahab were on the ground to monitor the election.\n\nLagos State Governor, Sanwo-Olu, who was on the ground for the congress, said he was not aware of any other congress in the state.\n\nAccording to him, other congresses were \u201cmere naming ceremonies.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking the national leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, the governor said: \u201cAsiwaju has called me twice while the congress is ongoing and I told him all is well.\n\n\u201cYou can see that females are well represented, almost outstripping the number of men. The team comprises men of timber and calibre. I hope the team will take Lagos to a higher level,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Baptist Academy premises, loyalists of the immediate former governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, under the aegis of Akinwunmi Ambode Campaign Organisation (AMCO), conducted their exercise with a former Chairman of the Mushin Local Government Area, Mrs. Beatrice Omotayo Tugbobo, emerging as the state APC chairman.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Tugbobo, who admitted that there were factions in Lagos APC, asserted that the exercise by her faction was being conducted in line with the party\u2019s constitution, which she said stipulated that the congress could be held by consensus arrangement or election.\n\n\u201cAccording to the constitution of APC, you can conduct your congresses whether by consensus or by voting and the agreement from the National Headquarters of APC constitutionally is that we hold our congresses in a consensus manner.\n\n\u201cOther factions can be holding their congresses elsewhere, yet we are holding our own here, which is AMCO, the group belonging to former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, the Lagos4Lagos group produced its consensus candidates at a congress held at the Airport Hotel in Ikeja.\n\nAlso, the congress held in Abia State produced two chairmen as each of the rival camps conducted its congress.\n\nMr. Enyinnaya Harbour was elected Chairman in the congress supervised by the seven-man State Congress Committee for Abia headed by Hon. Kolawole Babatunde, with Hon. Muktar Bajeh as Secretary.\n\nThe congress was held at the sprawling Chidiebere Motors Arena, Umuahia with two INEC representatives from the Abuja headquarters and Abia State office, present to observe the exercise.\n\nThe State Congress by loyalists of Chief Ikechi Emenike was organised at the Indoor Sports Hall of Umuahia Township Stadium.\n\nIn Imo State, the immediate past governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha, and the Board Chairman of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, were absent as the APC led by the state governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, conducted its state congress.\n\nAt the congress held in Owerri, the state capital, Uzodimma\u2019s aide and long-time loyalist, Macdonald Ebere emerged as the state chairman.\n\nEbere succeeded Marcon Nlemigbo who was in interim capacity shortly after Uzodimma took over power.\n\nBut Okorocha, through his media aide, Mr. Sam Onwuemeodo, said he was not aware APC held any congress in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware that there was APC congress in Imo State. What they did today was a birthday party. As long as we are concerned, Dan Nwafor is the authentic chairman of APC in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThere is an APC court judgment to that effect. It has not been vacated. You don\u2019t put something on nothing and expect it to stand.\u201d\n\nAlso amid protests by many party chieftains, who have called on the national leadership to cancel the state congress and previous congresses, the Senator Ovie Omo-Agege faction of the party in Delta State held a congress and announced a 35-man executive body to oversee the affairs of the state chapter of the party.\n\nA former political aide to ex-governor Emmanuel Uduaghan, Mr. Omeni Sobotie, emerged chairman of the new executive committee.\n\nThe exercise was conducted at the College of Education, Asaba premises by a seven-man Delta State APC Congress Committee, led by its Chairman, Senator Ajibola Bashiru, with officials of the INEC present as observers.\n\nThe factional congress was witnessed by the Deputy Senate President, Omo-Agege; Senate Committee Chairman on Niger Delta, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, founding leader of the party in the state, O\u2019tega Emerhor, among others.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the Delta State APC Leaders Council and the State Working Committee members have distanced themselves from what they described as a \u201cKangaroo State Congress organised by Deputy Senate President, Senator Omo-Agege and his cohorts.\n\nThe APC leaders stated this in a statement issued yesterday and jointly signed by its 19 members, including the Minister of State for Labour and Employment and Chairman of the Council, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN); Co-Chairman, Dr. Alex Ideh; the Secretary of the Council, Hon. Cairo Ojougboh; and 2019 APC governorship candidate in Delta State, Chief Great Ogboru, among others.\n\nThe council insisted that the national leadership of the party should correct the wrongs and anomalies in the Delta State chapter of the party by ensuring the execution of the recommendations of the John Odigie-Oyegun-led reconciliation committee, which had been submitted and accepted by the Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nThe APC leaders vowed that it would continue to uphold the sanctity of the party\u2019s change mantra.\n\nThe Niger State chapter of the party also split into two yesterday.\n\nOne of the factions of the party held its congress at a building along Bay Clinic Hospital road in Minna where Alhaji Nasiru Yussuf emerged as the chairman of the group.\n\nThey were denied the use of the Abdulsalami Abubakar Youth Centre.\n\nThe second congress attended by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello; his commissioners; and the three senators in the state, threw up a former Commissioner for Agriculture, Alhaji Haliru Zakari Jikantoro as chairman of the group.\n\nHowever, it was observed that the state Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, and the member representing Chanchaga Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Umar Mohammed Bago was absent at the congress held at the Justice Idris Legbo Kutigi Centre.\n\nIn Enugu State, the loyalists of a former Senate President, Chief Ken Nnamani, and former governor, Sullivan Chime in Enugu State, elected a former commissioner in the state, Chief Ugochukwu Agballah as the chairman of the party in the state.\n\nAt the congress supervised by the congress committee led by its chairman, Dr. Ijeomah Arodiogbu, Agballah defeated a former military governor of Gombe State, Group Captain Joe Orji (rtd), and Chief Paul Omeje to clinch the position.\n\nBoth Nnamani and Chime were said to have thrown their weight behind Orji, but more than 95 per cent of the delegates queued behind Agballah.\n\nHowever, the faction led by the former Chairman of the party in the state, Mr. Ben Nwoye also held a parallel congress at the state party secretariat.\n\nIn Kano State, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has declared that only the congress held at Sani Abacha Stadium was legal.\n\nPrince Abdullahi Abbas, who is the immediate-past caretaker chairman of the party in the state was elected as the chairman of the party.\n\nIn Sokoto State, the former acting governor and member representing Illela/ Gwadabawa Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Dr. Balarabe Salame has rejected the outcome of the congress.\n\nSalame told THISDAY that there was no congress in the state.\n\nSalame, who is of the same faction with the Speaker of Sokoto State House Assembly and other state Assembly members had planned to hold a parallel congress at DanMarna Primary School before his faction was told by the national headquarters of the APC to wait for amicable settlement of the issues.\n\nBut unknown to them, new executives emerged from the congress held by the other faction, led by the leader of the party in the state, Senator Aliyu Wamakko.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the re-elected chairman of the party in the state, Isa Sadiq Acida, promised to return the party to power in the state.\n\nIn Rivers State, the loyalists of a former Senator representing Rivers East, Senator Magnus Abe, shunned the exercise conducted by the loyalists of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nMr. Emeka Beke emerged as the Chairman of Rivers State APC, according to the results announced by the Chairman, Rivers APC Congress Screening Committee, Dr. Abubakar Idris.\n\nHowever, a member of the party, Golden Chioma, who made a last-minute pullout from the chairmanship race, described the exercise and the results as a nullity, citing \u201cfaulty process\u201d.\n\nAPC Suspends Oyo Congress\n\nMeanwhile, the party has postponed its state congress in Oyo State.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the congress was shifted following a directive from the national secretariat of the party.\n\nMembers of the party and journalists who had thronged the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium (formerly Liberty Stadium), Ibadan, venue of the congress earlier fixed for yesterday were surprised to learn about the postponement.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Dr. Abdulazeez Olatunde, who confirmed the postponement, said the postponement was necessary in order to harmonise the list of candidates for the positions.\n\n\u201cIt has been postponed. It was postponed to allow us harmonise the list,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ejiofor Alike\n\nThe United Kingdom government has warned its citizens in Nigeria against visiting 12 states in the country over possible terror attacks.\n\nThe advisory from the UK through its Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) followed concerns on the possibility of terrorists carrying out attacks in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement published on its website \u201cstill current at October 16, 2021,\u201d it expressed concern over protests and a heightened security presence in major cities due to the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe foreign government also urged its citizens to monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.\n\nThe UK listed the Nigerian states as: Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara.\n\nOther states are: Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River.\n\nThe FCDO also advised against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto and Kogi aand within 20kilometres of the border with Niger in Kebbi State, and Abia State.\n\nIt also cautioned UK citizens against travelling to the non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states.\n\nAccording to the advisory, events to mark the one year anniversary of #EndSARS protests are likely to take place nationally, week commencing October 18.\n\n\u201cThere may be protests and a heightened security presence in major cities such as Lagos and Abuja. In parallel, the high profile trial date of a separatist leader is also scheduled for 21 October in Abuja. There may be additional protests and a heightened security presence in Abuja and in the South-east for this reason. In all areas affected, you should monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings,\u201d the advisory stated.\n\nFCDO noted that from September 3, 2021, the Nigerian government had mandated for all telecommunication operators in Nigeria to stop extending services to Zamfara State.\n\nThis, according to the FCDO, includes a suspension of all mobile telecommunications, including WiFi.\n\nIt added that a number of other state governments, including Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger had also implemented a partial shutdown of telecom services.\n\n\u201cSince 9 August, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South-east region of Nigeria. Protests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, are likely during October in the South-east region. There have been reports of violence during Sit-at-Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces,\u201d the advisory explained.\n\nIt noted a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South-east and South-south regions, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi.\n\nAccording to the FCDO, some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations.\n\nIt, however, added that there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas.\n\n\u201cThere is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews.

          "text": "\u2022Seeks $55m lifeline\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that half a million women, men, and children in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states are at risk of starvation as its funding for the region dries up.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the global agency, which seeks a $55 million urgent lifeline, said it might soon be forced to cut food rations except it secures urgent funds to continue its life-saving operations in the crisis hotspot.\n\nThe region has been a mainstay of insurgency attacks for over a decade and the situation has been worsened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising high food prices, the WFP said.\n\nThe UN agency also said the number of internally displaced persons surpassed two million in September.\n\n\u201cCutting rations means choosing who gets to eat and who goes to bed hungry. We are seeing funding for our life-saving humanitarian work dry up just at the time when hunger is at its most severe,\u201d said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s Regional Director for West Africa, following a recent visit to Nigeria.\n\nThe WFP director said that current food security analyses showed that 4.4 million people in the North-east did not know where their next meal would come from, adding that more than one million children were already malnourished.\n\nHe cited continued attacks on communities by non-state armed groups, harsh and lean season conditions amid an economy dealing with the fallout from the COVID-19, as portending great danger for the people.\n\nNikoi added that high food prices and a severe reduction in household purchasing power had also contributed to a bleak outlook for the most vulnerable people in the North-east, warning that despite increasing needs, WFP may soon be unable to sustain life-saving operations in the conflict-riddled region.\n\nHe stated that the cuts would come just as severe hunger reached a five-year high in the country, in the wake of years of conflict and insecurity, noting that the situation had been worsened by the socio-economic fallout from COVID-19, high food prices, and limited food supply.\n\nHe added that the number of internally displaced surpassed two million in September 2021, reaching another grim milestone.\n\nNikoi warned that if at least $ 55 million was not received in a matter of weeks, WFP would have no choice but to cut food rations and reduce the number of people it serves, where assistance is already prioritised for the most vulnerable as early as November.\n\nThe WFP, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2020, said it required at least $55 million in a matter of weeks to avoid cutting food aid.\n\n\u201cOur food assistance is a lifeline for millions whose lives have been upended by conflict and have almost nothing to survive on. We must act now to save lives and avoid disruptions to this lifeline,\u201d Nikoi added.\n\nHe said that the number of Internally Displaced People (IDP) forced to flee their homes in search of safety in the North-east had been rising steadily, reaching a new all-time high of over two million in September 2021.\n\nThe United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said cutting food assistance \u201cwill be a painful decision for humanitarians as it will negatively affect children, women, and men uprooted from their homes due to continued violence.\n\n\u201cAs we call upon our partners to step up their support in response to the growing needs, I would like to say thank you to those who have stood with us over the years in providing the much-needed humanitarian assistance in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to its statement, the WFP said it has \u201cprovided life-saving food and nutrition assistance to severely food insecure people, displaced families in camps, and to vulnerable people living in host communities thanks to generous contributions from Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and private donors.\n\n\u201cThis year, relying on the continued generosity of donor partners, WFP ramped up its response to address rising food insecurity and the impact of COVID-19, targeting 1.9 million displaced people in Nigeria with life-saving food assistance.\n\n\u201cTo sustain humanitarian operations in the North-east Nigeria until March 2022, WFP urgently requires $197 million.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022South-west considers Arapaja for deputy national chairman\n\n\u2022How Wike, Ikpeazu, Ugwuanyi influenced the emergence of consensus national secretary\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFollowing the emergence of a former President of the Senate, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, as the consensus candidate for the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), pressure is being mounted on the suspended national chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, to withdraw the suit seeking the reaffirmation of his four-year tenure of office in line with Section 59 (3) Constitution of the PDP, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nAyu\u2019s emergence is expected to pave the way for a possible southern presidential candidate in the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a new realignment of political forces in the South-west, the party stakeholders in the region may have dumped the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former National Secretary of the party, Prof. Wale Oladipo, and asked the National Vice Chairman (South-west), Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja, to seek reelection as the Deputy National Chairman (South).\n\nFresh facts have also emerged on how Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State upstaged the former Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, and former governors of Imo State, Achike Udenwa and Emeka Ihedioha to produce a consensus candidate for the National Secretary of the PDP.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the emergence of Ayu as the northern consensus candidate for the National Chairman of the PDP, some selected leaders and stakeholders of the PDP have been reaching out to Secondus to withdraw his court case because of the implications and consequences the Court of Appeal judgment may have on the preparations for the October 31 national convention of the party.\n\nSome loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar have also called on the party to resolve all issues relating to Secondus or be ready to lose the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe High Court of Rivers State sitting in Degema had suspended Secondus as national chairman, but the suspension was set aside by a Kebbi State High Court.\n\nBut no sooner had the Kebbi court set the order aside than another High Court in Calabar, Cross River State reinforced the suspension of the embattled national chairman.\n\nSecondus has since appealed the orders of the two high courts at the Court of Appeal, where he is asking the court to reaffirm his four years tenure of office in line with Section 59 (3) Constitution of the PDP.\n\nIn the last sitting of the Court of Appeal, the court in a dramatic manner announced the transfer of the Secondus\u2019 appeal to Port Harcourt, stating that it was where the substantive suit originated.\n\nBut PDP stakeholders have wondered why the President of the Court of Appeal directed that the appeal between Senator Ugochukwu Uba and Valentine Ozigbo would be heard in Abuja, instead of Enugu.\n\nA source close to Secondus told THISDAY that the embattled national chairman has adopted a studied silence and refused to respond to the barrage of requests for him to withdraw the Court of Appeal suit against his suspension.\n\nThe Court of Appeal is expected to deliver judgment at any moment.\n\nAs the party continues preparation for the October 31 national convention, Atiku\u2019s former Special Adviser, Dr. Umar Ardo, has called on the party to resolve all issues relating to Secondus or be ready to lose the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is my assessment of the material politics on the ground that until the Secondus issue is justly and conclusively resolved, it \u2018ll be delusional to think PDP will go into the election cycle of 2023 with the faintest hope of coming out victorious,\u201d Ardo said in a statement.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe variables don\u2019t seem to add up for the simple fact that one cannot hope to win on injustice and illegitimacy because this is a logical social law!\n\n\u201cStill our latter-day PDP stakeholders, the old and new party oligarchs, seem to see that they can, forgetting that they\u2019ve always in the past failed. It\u2019s not about the individuals involved, just as of now it\u2019s not about Secondus, but that of torching the hardcore principles of justice and rule of law. Yet, they don\u2019t learn their lessons and make amends.\n\n\u201cAs one who went to court 11 times against the sheer acts of impunity of the party, I know PDP lost in 2015 and 2019 presidential elections mainly as consequences of such acts,\u201d he explained.\n\nSouth-west Considers Arapaja for Deputy National Chairman\n\nMeanwhile, in a new realignment of political forces in the South-west, the party stakeholders in the region may have dumped the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, and a former National Secretary of the party, Prof. Wale Oladipo, for the position of the Deputy National Chairman of the party for South.\n\nThe South-west PDP stakeholders have asked the National Vice Chairman, Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja, to seek re-election as the Deputy National Chairman for the South.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the development was due to the crisis in Osun PDP.\n\nIn compliance, Arapaja, at the weekend resigned as the vice national chairman for South-west and obtained a nomination form to seek election as the consensus deputy national chairman (South).\n\nBefore then, stakeholders of the PDP had scheduled Oyinlola as the deputy national chairman for South.\n\nThe most contentious of the positions, which party leaders tried but failed to reach an agreement on, is the seat of Deputy National Chairman (South), zoned to Osun State and desired by Oyinlola, and Oladipo.\n\nThe Sunday Bisi-led Osun State chapter of the party, said to be loyal to the PDP governorship candidate in the 2019 elections, Senator Ademola Adeleke, had nominated Oladipo for the position ahead of the convention.\n\nBut Arapaja, who is said to be loyal to the Oyo State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde, was told by party leaders in the South-west to resign and obtained a nomination form for the deputy national chairman.\n\nHow Wike, Ikpeazu, Ugwuanyi Influenced Emergence of Consensus National Secretary\n\nMeanwhile, fresh facts have also emerged on how Governors Wike of Rivers State; Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and Ikpeazu of Abia State upstaged the former Senate President, Senator Anyim, and former governors of Imo State, Udenwa and Ihedioha to produce the consensus candidate for the National Secretary of the PDP.\n\nThe PDP South-east Zonal Caucus of the party had on Thursday in Enugu, adopted Senator Sam Nnaemeka Anyanwu, who was backed by Wike, as the consensus candidate of the zone for the job of PDP National Secretary.\n\nBefore the adoption, former Minister of Aviation and Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Mr. Osita Chidoka believed to be sponsored by a presidential aspirant from the South-east; and the Director-General of the PDP Governors Forum, Hon. Cyril Maduabum, who was perceived to be sponsored by the Chairman of the forum, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State were the front-runners.\n\nBefore the announcement of Anyanwu as the consensus national secretary, Wike flew into Enugu, where he was believed to have held brief discussions with Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu at the airport before he left.\n\nThereafter, Governors Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu went to the meeting where the adoption of Anyanwu was announced by the National Vice Chairman of PDP in the zone, Ali Odefa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A YouTuber, Israel Balogun who runs the Wholeness Africa Initiatives channel, has alleged death threats to his life by members of the Omega Fire Ministries led by Apostle Johnson Suleman over a 'Miracle Money' scandal.\n\nIn one of his videos on YouTube, Balogun analysed and condemned a video from two of the programmes of the church, one in Atlanta, USA, titled, 'Impact 2021' which was held in July and a June 2021 programme, Holy Ghost Conference 2021 held in Auchi, Edo State Nigeria, tagged, 'Harvest of Miracle Money'.\n\nBalogun, in the video, that has generated controversies, had said there was nothing like miracle money but a planned scheme to make people believe angels were dropping money into their accounts.\n\nHe also alleged that the pastor and ministers of the church will use such tactics to take double of such amounts from church members who received the miracle money.\n\nThe video of the controversial programme shows Suleman saying, \"The Holy Ghost just whispered to me, I'm going to pray and make declarations, after that you will check your account.\u201d\n\nAnother voice said, \"Papa (a term used by church members for Suleman), there is a miracle alert here, she just got her alert of $1,000.\"\n\nSuleman said again, \"Miracle alert, as you get it, run here. Angels begin to put money in your account.\"\n\nIn his analysis that has now brought about threats, Balogun said, \"Apostle Suleman is destroying the gospel of God, why would a man begin by telling people there will be miracle money in their accounts, you are using the name of Christ to do Miracle or Magic?\n\n\u201cThis is not the gospel, this man stood in the midst of the people, in the church in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria asking people to bring out their phones and there would be miracle money in their account. You must not fold your arms and allow such a thing to continue, Nigerian Christian leaders must dissociate themselves from something like this, they must tell the world that they are never part of the gospel that this man is preaching.\n\n\u201cThis is not Christ, this is not Christianity, this is voodoo, this is magic, this is not from God and it can never be from God. God does not deposit money in people's accounts, angels do not share money. It is either this guy has some people behind the scenes who have pre-collected people's bank details, who do not even know they wanted to use it for anything.\n\n\u201cThey might have asked people to fill some particular forms and asking them to make their bank details on that form and using that form to distribute the money at the time the programme was going on. These people are going to pay more for the money they collected, time will come when they will ask them to sow the seed and pay 'dangerous tithes', they will pay double of that money back to the ministry and this man (Suleman) is using this tactic. There is nothing like angels distributing money into people's accounts.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"This video is that of a man who has an arrangement with some guys, this is what they do behind the scenes. They would have collected information of people before now and so when the man starts the programme, the guys who want to do it have already programmed it, automated payments at the time the money will be released.\n\n\u201cAnd when the time comes, those people will pay in double because that trick will make them believe it is God and henceforth whatsoever the man of God tells them has to be obeyed, that is why I said the church must stand against that kind of practice and bring sanity back to Christianity.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up video, Balogun said he was being threatened for all he had said in the video. According to him, members of the Omega Fire Ministries have reached out to him, threatening to kill him and \u2019get rid of him'.\n\nHe said, \"After the video that I made analysing how Apostle Johnson Suleman did a 'Miracle Money' in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria, this year 2021, June and July, I have received countless calls, messages from his members telling me that they are coming after me, that I will get missing, they will make sure no one hears of me, that they have the power to send me to where I belong.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, one of them said and confirmed on his platform that he will let me hear the language that I understand and I think the last time such message was mentioned in my country, Nigeria, means that anyone who carries firearms will be shot or those called bandits shot on sight and I have never been part of bandits or to carry firearms, but the guy said I will be gotten rid of.\"\n\nBalogun also played a recording from the conversation he had with one Obi-West Utchaychukwu, a purported follower of Apostle Suleman who said, \"You are suffering, you are looking for followers, you have the guts to ridicule Apostle Suleman, wait I will send my photo to you, you will see my photo on WhatsApp, I travelled to Ukraine and I interview undercover.\n\n\u201cI have Adelaja, your mentor, on my palm and for me to kill you is a small thing and I will pick you up, I am already on your case. You are looking for followers that will subscribe to your channel. You want to use the man of God, you want to use Apostle Suleman for ridicule so that you will get traffic to your page, you are lying, I will get you, go and mark it, I will get you.\"\n\nBalogun continued, \"This call comes from a man who called himself Obi-West Utchaychukwu, he lives in Finland and he called me on WhatsApp threatening me that my life is about to come to an end because I spoke against the 'Money Miracle' of Apostle Johnson Suleman in Atlanta and not only that, many of the members of Omega Fire have come to my DM to threaten me, that they will shut me up, they said they know the address of my house, that they know where my wife works and where my family resides, they said they are coming for me.\n\n\u201cI am making this video to Nigerians and to anyone watching it right now, if I get missing, if nothing is being heard of my family, if anything happens whatsoever, know that these men are the ones behind it. They will say it, they will do it and this phrase of 'you will get missing is common to Omega Fire Ministries founder, Apostle Suleman because on many occasions people had issues with him and we have heard audio messages of him talking to someone that the person will not be found anymore.\n\n\u201cI don't know when I will get missing but I am calling on Nigerians and other well-to-do individuals, please do not let my death be in vain, because these men could be dangerous and whatever it is.\n\n\u201cI, Israel Balogun, will not stop talking until the day I get missing, I will keep talking about the messages that have polluted our pulpits that have turned our Christianity to paganism, I will continue to talk until mammon is dethroned, and Christ takes over his pulpit in Nigeria, I will continue to talk until you guys stop encouraging laziness and commanding money into people's accounts.\n\n\u201cGod himself designed the earth that until we till the ground, we can never make profit. It is labour that gives profit, not a miracle when people begin to have money in their accounts just by a pastor commanding it, you have destroyed the value of labour, work, dignity, you make people believe in miracles that can change their stories overnight instead of them to pass through the process of success.\n\n\u201cApostle Johnson Suleman, you can kill me, you can get rid of me, you can call IGP (Inspector General of Police) to pick me up today but remember, there are millions of my kind that will rise up in Nigeria, that will spring forth; they will speak and demand that you stop doing this.\u201d",

These people are going to pay more for the money they collected, time will come when they will ask them to sow the seed and pay 'dangerous tithes', they will pay double of that money back to the ministry and this man (Suleman) is using this tactic. There is nothing like angels distributing money into people's accounts.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\"This video is that of a man who has an arrangement with some guys, this is what they do behind the scenes. They would have collected information of people before now and so when the man starts the programme, the guys who want to do it have already programmed it, automated payments at the time the money will be released.\n\n\u201cAnd when the time comes, those people will pay in double because that trick will make them believe it is God and henceforth whatsoever the man of God tells them has to be obeyed, that is why I said the church must stand against that kind of practice and bring sanity back to Christianity.\u201d\n\nIn a follow-up video, Balogun said he was being threatened for all he had said in the video. According to him, members of the Omega Fire Ministries have reached out to him, threatening to kill him and \u2019get rid of him'.\n\nHe said, \"After the video that I made analysing how Apostle Johnson Suleman did a 'Miracle Money' in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria, this year 2021, June and July, I have received countless calls, messages from his members telling me that they are coming after me, that I will get missing, they will make sure no one hears of me, that they have the power to send me to where I belong.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, one of them said and confirmed on his platform that he will let me hear the language that I understand and I think the last time such message was mentioned in my country, Nigeria, means that anyone who carries firearms will be shot or those called bandits shot on sight and I have never been part of bandits or to carry firearms, but the guy said I will be gotten rid of.\"\n\nBalogun also played a recording from the conversation he had with one Obi-West Utchaychukwu, a purported follower of Apostle Suleman who said, \"You are suffering, you are looking for followers, you have the guts to ridicule Apostle Suleman, wait I will send my photo to you, you will see my photo on WhatsApp, I travelled to Ukraine and I interview undercover.\n\n\u201cI have Adelaja, your mentor, on my palm and for me to kill you is a small thing and I will pick you up, I am already on your case. You are looking for followers that will subscribe to your channel. You want to use the man of God, you want to use Apostle Suleman for ridicule so that you will get traffic to your page, you are lying, I will get you, go and mark it, I will get you.\"\n\nBalogun continued, \"This call comes from a man who called himself Obi-West Utchaychukwu, he lives in Finland and he called me on WhatsApp threatening me that my life is about to come to an end because I spoke against the 'Money Miracle' of Apostle Johnson Suleman in Atlanta and not only that, many of the members of Omega Fire have come to my DM to threaten me, that they will shut me up, they said they know the address of my house, that they know where my wife works and where my family resides, they said they are coming for me.\n\n\u201cI am making this video to Nigerians and to anyone watching it right now, if I get missing, if nothing is being heard of my family, if anything happens whatsoever, know that these men are the ones behind it. They will say it, they will do it and this phrase of 'you will get missing is common to Omega Fire Ministries founder, Apostle Suleman because on many occasions people had issues with him and we have heard audio messages of him talking to someone that the person will not be found anymore.\n\n\u201cI don't know when I will get missing but I am calling on Nigerians and other well-to-do individuals, please do not let my death be in vain, because these men could be dangerous and whatever it is.\n\n\u201cI, Israel Balogun, will not stop talking until the day I get missing, I will keep talking about the messages that have polluted our pulpits that have turned our Christianity to paganism, I will continue to talk until mammon is dethroned, and Christ takes over his pulpit in Nigeria, I will continue to talk until you guys stop encouraging laziness and commanding money into people's accounts.\n\n\u201cGod himself designed the earth that until we till the ground, we can never make profit. It is labour that gives profit, not a miracle when people begin to have money in their accounts just by a pastor commanding it, you have destroyed the value of labour, work, dignity, you make people believe in miracles that can change their stories overnight instead of them to pass through the process of success.\n\n\u201cApostle Johnson Suleman, you can kill me, you can get rid of me, you can call IGP (Inspector General of Police) to pick me up today but remember, there are millions of my kind that will rise up in Nigeria, that will spring forth; they will speak and demand that you stop doing this.\u201d",
          "summary": "A YouTuber, Israel Balogun who runs the Wholeness Africa Initiatives channel, has alleged death threats to his life by members of the Omega Fire Ministries led by Apostle Johnson Suleman over a 'Miracle Money' scandal.\nBalogun, in the video, that has generated controversies, had said there was nothing like miracle money but a planned scheme to make people believe angels were dropping money into their accounts.\nHe also alleged that the pastor and ministers of the church will use such tactics to take double of such amounts from church members who received the miracle money.\nSuleman said again, \"Miracle alert, as you get it, run here.\nGod does not deposit money in people's accounts, angels do not share money.",

          "text": "The United Kingdom (UK) says Boko Haram insurgents are likely to kidnap foreign nationals, warning its citizens against travelling to twelve states in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) announced this on Friday in a travel advisory for its nationals.\n\nThe UK government said there is a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria for ideological, financial or political gain.\n\n\u201cThe groups have previously shown intent and capability to conduct kidnaps in Nigeria. Foreign nationals, including humanitarian workers, are likely targets for kidnap. Humanitarian hubs and humanitarian workers have been targeted during attacks in the North East, including Monguno, Borno State on 13 June 2020,\u201d the advisory reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria. Kidnaps can be motivated by criminality or terrorism and could be carried out for ideological, financial or political gain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk of kidnap increases after dark.\n\n\u201cThe security environment in the North East has deteriorated since 2018 and there is a heightened risk of kidnap. Kidnaps in the North East have included humanitarian and private sector workers. There are also reports that Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are continuing to actively plan to kidnap foreigners. As well as in North-East Nigeria, extremist groups operate in some northern and middle belt states including Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Niger and Adamawa states. If you\u2019re working or travelling in these States then you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe UK government also advised its citizens to be careful as events to mark the one year anniversary of #EndSARS protests may lead to additional protests in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government also said the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), scheduled for October 21 may lead to protests and heightened security presence in Abuja and in the south-east.\n\n\u201cSince 9 August, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South East region of Nigeria. Protests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, are likely during October in the South East region. There have been reports of violence during Stay at Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces,\u201d the advisory further reads.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South-east and Southsouth regions of Nigeria, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi. Some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas. There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders.\n\n\u201cA number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are the 12 states:",

Foreign nationals, including humanitarian workers, are likely targets for kidnap. Humanitarian hubs and humanitarian workers have been targeted during attacks in the North East, including Monguno, Borno State on 13 June 2020,\u201d the advisory reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a high threat of kidnap throughout Nigeria. Kidnaps can be motivated by criminality or terrorism and could be carried out for ideological, financial or political gain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk of kidnap increases after dark.\n\n\u201cThe security environment in the North East has deteriorated since 2018 and there is a heightened risk of kidnap. Kidnaps in the North East have included humanitarian and private sector workers. There are also reports that Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) are continuing to actively plan to kidnap foreigners. As well as in North-East Nigeria, extremist groups operate in some northern and middle belt states including Bauchi, Gombe, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Niger and Adamawa states. If you\u2019re working or travelling in these States then you should be aware of the risk of terrorist kidnapping.\u201d\n\nThe UK government also advised its citizens to be careful as events to mark the one year anniversary of #EndSARS protests may lead to additional protests in Lagos and Abuja.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government also said the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), scheduled for October 21 may lead to protests and heightened security presence in Abuja and in the south-east.\n\n\u201cSince 9 August, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South East region of Nigeria. Protests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, are likely during October in the South East region. There have been reports of violence during Stay at Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces,\u201d the advisory further reads.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South-east and Southsouth regions of Nigeria, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi. Some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas. There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders.\n\n\u201cA number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are the 12 states:",

          "title": "INSIGHT: Piracy hurting Nigeria\u2019s music industry \u2014 but is it a necessary evil?",
          "text": "In the late \u201990s and early 2000s, the incursion of file-sharing monsters like Napster, Limewire, and Kazaa into global music nearly brought the industry to its knees. Showbiz and its legal backings, many would argue, were largely unprepared for the shifts that accompanied the emergence of the internet and digital space. Artistes panicked. Top players and labels like Warner Brothers, Sony, Universal, Island, and Interscope were soon locked in fierce legal tussles with these platforms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHalf a decade earlier was the age of the CD boom, which would phase out the cassette era. By the year 2000, dominant genres of the \u201880s and \u201890s took the backseat in Nigeria as Afrobeats became the top choice in the clubs and street shows.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before piracy started eating into profits. Street-to-street record selling had been a norm at the time; e-distribution had yet to catch on. Makeshift city stores churning out thousands of pirated CDs and compilations of various sorts proliferated \u2014 a trend that greatly denied artistes the perquisites of their intellectual property (IP). This reality would take on a new dimension with the advent of digital streaming platforms (DSPs).\n\nIn the 2010s, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to see club owners and nightlife promoters throng commercial hubs like Lagos\u2019 Alaba market from far and near to load up flash drives with trending hits. Today, Nigeria\u2019s music industry players still struggle to knock out random blogs illegally offering songs for free, barely minutes after they debut on streamers like Apple and Spotify.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nN10.5 trillion lost/unrealised annually \u2014 how bad is e-piracy currently?\n\nA population of 210 million \u2014 where about 62% are below age 25 \u2014 should be a positive indicator for entertainment firms, making for a rather large market to milk. It should translate to increased streaming numbers enough to rake in more income and significantly drive GDP. A lot of music is created in Nigeria, with new musicians frequently coming aboard. Hundreds of albums are produced annually, covering a wide range of genres. Indigenous hitmakers have severally clinched deals with major labels and bagged prestigious awards after hitting the limelight globally.\n\nNigeria\u2019s music culture continues to grow, with Afrobeats gaining worldwide acceptance but this doesn\u2019t reflect as much as it should in revenue. The entertainment industry was valued at $3.6 billion in 2016 and was projected to hit $6.4 billion by 2021. Music revenue alone, PwC revealed, would hit $73 million in 2021, growing at 13.4% yearly. In comparison, South Africa, with 60 million in population, has its music revenue projected to hit $188 million in 2021, growing at 5.5% annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese statistics show that Nigeria\u2019s music executives face difficulties monetising musical works and exploiting the country\u2019s demographic dividends. The industry struggles with illegal uploads and downloads and this was evident when Johnny Drille, an alternative rock star, begged fans in March 2021 not to download but stream his projects. Music shouldn\u2019t be free but, for some reason, the majority of Nigerian hit songs are on blogs at no cost.\n\nIt is not exactly easy to ascertain how much Nigeria\u2019s music industry loses to piracy in its entirety but Pretty Okafor, president of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN), put it at a mindboggling N10.5 trillion annually while accounting for unclaimed royalties globally and nonpayment for the usage of Nigerian works across Africa.\n\nOutdated anti-piracy laws & how technology is saving artistes\n\nRights accruable to owners of musical works are captured in the Nigerian Copyright Act (NCA) of 2004. However, music industry executives argue that it doesn\u2019t adequately account for trends in the digital economy. Mayowa Ayilaran, the CEO of the Music Copyright Society of Nigeria (MCSN), also cited delays in the justice system, which he said often results in situations where many infringement cases drag on for long in court. He cited an example of the organisation\u2019s protracted tussle with Multichoice, which he said was in court from 2006 to 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYemi Oladapo, entertainment lawyer and ex-licensing/publishing manager at Mavin Records, said laws need to be updated to allow automatic takedowns of illegally distributed music. He said the challenge with seeking redress in court isn\u2019t so much about updated laws as it is about swift justice delivery and digitally literate judges.\n\n\u201cNCA 2004 provides for copyright protection generally, depending on how you interpret and enforce it. But in the specifics of how digital technology in music has evolved, it\u2019s important that our laws address them. You can write laws and make them very long but the big problem isn\u2019t the law; it\u2019s the enforcement part of it,\u201d Oladapo said.\n\nEdward Israel-Ayide, former marketing & business development manager at Chocolate City, said the only tool many artistes have at their disposal is to get the owners of the websites to take down the illegal content.\n\n\u201cIn established markets, you have a structure that allows DMCA takedowns. It\u2019s a service where you ask the ISP hosting the site or the service of whoever uploaded that content to take down the content from that website; online file. The good thing is a lot of artistes now have international distribution deals either directly or through third parties. These distributors protect their own investment by subscribing to DMCA service providers,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf anyone puts up that music, they can then take it down. For instance, you distribute to Apple Music through Africori, which actively looks out for illegal music uploads. They reach out and have it taken down instantly.\u201d\n\nTo stem the tide of illegal distribution, MCSN adopted a recognition technology to monitor music usage across digital and terrestrial platforms. With a dashboard, artistes access data that forecast revenue and track the usage of their works by radio, clubs, and DSPs to social media and more. The app was introduced into the market in June 2020 and rolled out in early 2021 but getting all stakeholders to adopt this system, Okafor explained, remains the challenge.\n\nOnline piracy paradox \u2014 artiste inaction & the \u2018necessary evil\u2019\n\nCampaigns have been staged to educate music stakeholders on how illegal uploads cut down revenue. Consequently, some pirate sites rebased their brands away from downloads. But a Google search on any Nigerian hitmaker still shows random blogs offering their songs for free. This pushes consumers to patronise these platforms rather than stream or buy songs from DSPs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also the self-harm by artistes who patronise pirate sites as a marketing strategy that caters to low-income audiences who can neither afford to buy songs on the licensed DSPs nor pay streaming subscriptions. World Bank estimates that 98 million Nigerians \u2014about 47.3 percent give or take \u2014 live in poverty. Nigerian artistes don\u2019t make the bulk of their earnings from streaming. They leverage brand endorsements, merchandise sales, and concerts to break even \u2014 hence, they are inclined to jump at avenues to achieve wider audience coverage.\n\nIn early 2021, Dotman, an Afropop singer, had argued that many Nigerian artistes need piracy to attain increased music circulation due to a structure he claimed is rigged against creatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, but in an industry like ours, do we need the piracy? I won\u2019t lie. Yes, we do, so this thing can circulate. Let any artiste prove me wrong they don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s crazy! If we had a proper detailed structure on how things should move or flow in an industry like ours, piracy won\u2019t even be a conversation,\u201d Dotman had told TheCable Lifestyle.\n\nCommenting on this point of view, Edward said some artistes actively encourage the e-piracy culture by giving out their songs to blogs for free upload.\n\n\u201cThey feel the streaming ecosystem is a bit limited. They want to reach more people. I don\u2019t want to mention names but some online pirates became celebrities in the music industry and a lot of artistes are friends with them,\u201d the ex-label executive said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve become allies in some way that they owe these guys for what they are. Some rebased their businesses but many still put up music for free. An artiste or label needs to make an example of these guys. But a lot of those who you would expect should be at the forefront of the fight against e-piracy see it as a necessary evil.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the effect of this shared reality and the difficulty artistes face in tackling it, Reminisce, a multi-genre hitmaker, noted: \u201cYou can release your album in Surulere, Lagos today and find a website in Romania offering it for free in a few hours. How will you get the police to go arrest them?\n\n\u201cWe often rely on technology to help us fight this menace and, while that is being done, we focus on creating the content. We still need globally enforceable IP laws.\u201d\n\nAudience reach & opportunity cost \u2014 finding the balance\n\nThe average price for legally downloading music albums in Nigeria on iTunes ranges between N1,500 and N2000 (about $3.7 to $4.9 at N411 per dollar), as against those of many foreign artistes which can cost as much as $9.9 per album download. EPs and singles are often cheaper, with Tiwa Savage\u2019s body of work \u2018Water & Garri\u2019 costing only N700, less than $2. A month\u2019s streaming subscription for Apple Music costs about N900.\n\nTo ascertain consumer behaviour, 24 randomly selected music listeners in Lagos were asked about their usage of streaming platforms. The majority \u2014 87 percent \u2014 said they had never bought music albums on DSPs or considered paying subscription fees. Probed further, they argued that a fee of N1,800 on iTunes was \u201ctoo costly\u201d while others cited the existence of free alternatives.\n\nSpeaking to this, Edward said: \u201cIllegal downloads can also be due to structure in the distribution chain. Some listeners don\u2019t understand the streaming tech. It could be that they\u2019re willing to pay but not so much as they\u2019re being billed. Maybe there\u2019s a gap someone has fill and make people pay a negligible fee for legal access to albums and singles.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, they don\u2019t patronise pirate sites because the content is free but due to user experience. People at times just want to download music and pay for data once. The idea of them having to pay through data every time they want to play that music is still strange or not cost-effective. These are gaps we need to fix. It\u2019s not the fault of artistes or the industry. It\u2019s just the reality of things. Nigeria is a poor country, whether we want to accept it or not.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerian artistes who allow their music to remain on pirate sites see it as an opportunity to get more traction. While it doesn\u2019t directly translate to revenue, it allows them to connect with audiences at the grassroots, and this helps them to recoup their losses by potentially selling out local and cross-national shows.\n\nOn how artistes can maximise coverage without using pirate blogs, Oladapo said: \u201cYou can twist it such that you\u2019re using legal platforms while creating an avenue for relatively cheap or free music via Sound Cloud, Audiomack, or Boomplay. We focus on one approach when solving [but] it has to be holistic, where we get to educate all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to analyse the driving forces of piracy. We did ourselves the disservice of looking at it one-sidedly for so long. We have to be economically realistic. If I\u2019ve not eaten this morning, I won\u2019t think about buying music. Artistes need to maintain that their songs are not going to be released on blogs for free but on certain streamers.\u201d\n\nBottom line: Pushing Nigeria\u2019s understandably frugal music listeners to adjust and see songs as commercial products that have to be purchased will cost indigenous artistes some hits and initial losses, yet, consumer behaviour changes. It only takes time and investment in developing affordable and easy-to-use solutions.\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "Why Nigerian neobank, Sparkle, preferred local investors in $3.1m funding",
          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes.

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber",
          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",
          "summary": "She decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time.\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria.\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\nAt OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari, asking the court to \u201cdeclare illegal and unconstitutional the plan by the administration to track, intercept and monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, as it severely threatens and violates the right to the preservation of privacy.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the proposal in the Supplementary Appropriation Act signed in July 2021 to spend N4.87 billion to monitor private calls and messages. The amount is part of the N895.8 billion supplementary budget approved by the National Assembly.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1240/2021 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and any other authority, persons or group of persons from unlawfully monitoring the WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201ca declaration that any monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is oppressive and draconian, as it threatens and violates sections 37 and 39 of Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended]; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that \u201cThe plan to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is an arbitrary interference by the administration into respect for family and private life, the home, and correspondence. It also fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights. Monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cThe mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.\u201d\n\nSERAP is further arguing that \u201cPrivacy and expression are intertwined in the digital age, with online privacy serving as a gateway to secure exercise of the freedom of opinion and expression. Therefore, targets of surveillance would suffer interference with their rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression whether the effort to monitor is successful or not.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondents are Abubakar Malami, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation; and Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cThe powers to conduct arbitrary, abusive or unlawful surveillance of communications may also be used to target political figures and activists, journalists and others in the discharge of their lawful activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the right to freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy and correspondence, communications and private data.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 19 of the Covenant also guarantee the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UN General Assembly has condemned unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and interception of communications as \u2018highly intrusive acts\u2019 that interfere with fundamental human rights (see General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 71/199).\u201d\n\n\u201cInterference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Surveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTargeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking the following reliefs:\n\nA DECLARATION that monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is inconsistent with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality and amounts to threat and infringement on the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press guaranteed under sections 37 and 39 of Nigeria Constitution, 1999; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights A DECLARATION that the act of the Defendants budgeting N4.87bn of public money to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is unlawful and a violation of the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press AN ORDER setting aside the budget line of N4.87bn to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people for being inconsistent and incompatible with constitutional provisions, and international human rights treaties AN ORDER mandating the 1st Respondent to redirect public funds in the sum of N4.87bn budgeted to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people to improve the working conditions of healthcare practitioners and improve public healthcare facilities across Nigeria AND FOR SUCH FURTHER ORDER OR ORDERS that this Honourable\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nPrince Gboyega Famodun and Hon. Rasaq Salinsile have emerged chairmen of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Osun State, as party members today, held parallel congresses.\n\nWhile Hon. Salinsile was elected chairman in the Congress organised by The Osun Progressives (TOP), a faction within the party loyal to former governor of the state and current minister of interior, Rauf Aregbesola, Prince Famodun was elected chairman by faction led by the incumbent governor of the state, Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe TOP Congress, which was almost disrupted by hoodlums who stormed the venue and started shooting sporadically, but were repelled by security operatives who engaged them in gun battle, equally saw the emergence a former Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Adelani Baderinwa, as State Secretary.\n\nMeanwhile, Famodun got a second term of four years as chairman of the party in the state, the Oyetola faction being the officially recognized leadership of the party in the state.\n\nMr. Tajudeen Lawal, the current state commissioner for Home Affairs also emerged as the Party\u2019s Deputy Chairman, while Alhaja Kudirat Fakokunde returned as the leader of the Women Wing.\n\nAlso 35-year old Akinwemimo Adegoke emerged as the Youth Leader of the party just as Mr. Alao Kamar Olabisi emerged as the secretary.\n\nGovernor Oyetola while speaking during the congress held at Osogbo township stadium, charged the party executives in the state to ensure a reconciliatory process that will guarantee the unity and strength that the Party is known for.\n\nAnnouncing the results of the Congress, the Chairman of the National Committee on the Osun State Congress, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye, said the Congress was done in line with the principles and guidelines of the Party.\n\nHe appealed to sympathisers who were not allowed into the venue of the Congress to demonstrate understanding, explaining that only delegates were allowed in the venue because the event was a Congress and not a rally.\n\nElegbeleye, who read out Article 20 of the Party\u2019s Constitution to the delegates, also announced that voice vote was adopted because of the population of the accredited delegates, which totalled 1,840.\n\n\u201cI wish to start by referring our delegates and party leaders to Article 20 (Elections and Appointment) of the APC Constitution. I want to read it out: \u2018All party posts prescribed or implied by this Constitution shall be filled by democratically conducted elections at the respective National Convention or Congress, subject, where possible, to Concensus, provided that where a candidate has emerged by concensus for an elective position, a vote of \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 by ballot or voice shall be called, to ensure that it was not an imposition which could breed discontent or crisis,\u201d Elegbeleye read.\n\nOyetola, while addressing Party Delegates after the Congress, reiterated his commitment to a vibrant and rock-solid All Progressives Congress in Osun, calling on all stakeholders to follow suit.\n\nHe congratulated the new executives, charging them to rise to the occasion by promptly mending broken walls and building collapsed bridges for the greater good of the Party and, by extension, the State.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the newly- elected executives of our Party. I urge you to discharge your responsibility with the fear of God and ensure you carry everyone along in the running of the affairs of the party. Let us have a vibrant party that can compete anywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cI thank the team from Abuja for accepting to serve the Party by coming down to Osun to conduct, monitor and supervise the State Congress.\n\n\u201cI thank party leaders and stakeholders for their support and understanding so far and for contributing to the hitch-free exercise.\n\n\u201cI thank members for your understanding and cooperation with the Government. I appeal to you to extend same to the newly-elected party officials. I appeal to those who lost out not to lose hope. I assure you all of a better tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThe All Progressives Congress emerged on the strength of unity and progressive ideals. We are still committed to these ideals regardless of some of narratives making the rounds out there.\n\n\u201cI urge the newly-elected executives to ensure reconciliatory process. We cannot rule out the fact that some members are aggrieved for one or more reasons, but this is nothing out of proportion. We remain one united family, and we remain focused on delivering unprecedented progress and development to Osun\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nIn his acceptance remark, the State Party Chairman-elect, Prince Famodun, lauded the Congress as impressive, well-organised and peaceful.\n\nHe called on Party members and stakeholders to channel the same energy and unity towards the primaries in February 2022 and the governorship election scheduled for July 2022.\n\n\u201cWe trust God that this Party will remain strong and indivisible. We appeal to our family members who are aggrieved and out there to return home. The Governor has extended the olive branch.\n\n\u201cIt is on this basis that I also extend an olive branch to the members of our political family who are disenchanted to bury the hatchet in order to collectively work for the re-election of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola during next year\u2019s governorship election. Let\u2019s join hands together and perform our usual political feat of ensuring the continuity of the ruling government. Time is not on our side. Let\u2019s work for the perpetuation of our government in Osun State through all- known legitimate means\u201d, Famodun said.",

          "title": "Buhari, Malami sued over 'plan to monitor WhatsApp messages'",
          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe human rights group asked the court to \u201cdeclare illegal and unconstitutional the plan by Buhari\u2019s administration to track, intercept and monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people, as it severely threatens and violates the right to the preservation of privacy.\u201d\n\nThe suit followed the proposal in the Supplementary Appropriation Act signed in July 2021 to spend N4.87bn to monitor private calls and messages. The amount is part of the N895.8bn supplementary budget approved by the National Assembly.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/1240/2021 filed last Friday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, SERAP is seeking: \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and any other authority, persons or group of persons from unlawfully monitoring the WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201ca declaration that any monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages is oppressive and draconian, as it threatens and violates sections 37 and 39 of Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended]; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that \u201cThe plan to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages is an arbitrary interference by the administration into respect for family and private life, the home, and correspondence. It also fails to meet the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe Buhari administration has legal obligations to protect Nigerians and other people against arbitrary interference and violations of their human rights. Monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages would grant free rein to government agencies to conduct mass surveillance of communications of people.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that \u201cThe mere threat of mass surveillance, even when secret, coupled with the lack of remedy, can constitute an interference with human rights, including the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association.\u201d\n\nSERAP is further arguing that \u201cPrivacy and expression are intertwined in the digital age, with online privacy serving as a gateway to secure exercise of the freedom of opinion and expression. Therefore, targets of surveillance would suffer interference with their rights to privacy and freedom of opinion and expression whether the effort to monitor is successful or not.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondents are Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation; and Mrs Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning.\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Kehinde Oyewumi, read in part: \u201cThe powers to conduct arbitrary, abusive or unlawful surveillance of communications may also be used to target political figures and activists, journalists and others in the discharge of their lawful activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny spending of public funds should stay within the limits of constitutional responsibilities, and oath of office by public officers, as well as comply with Chapter 2 of the Nigerian Constitution relating to fundamental objectives and directive principles of state policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of any safeguards against discriminatory decision-making, and access to an effective remedy shows the grave threats the purported plan poses to constitutionally and internationally recognized human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 37 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provide for the right to freedom from arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy and correspondence, communications and private data.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 39 of the Nigerian Constitution and Article 19 of the Covenant also guarantee the right of everyone to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UN General Assembly has condemned unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and interception of communications as \u2018highly intrusive acts\u2019 that interfere with fundamental human rights (see General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 71/199).\u201d\n\n\u201cInterference with privacy through targeted surveillance is designed to repress the exercise of the right to freedom of expression. Surveillance of journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics and others simply exercising their right to freedom of expression \u2013 would lead to violations of other human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cTargeted surveillance creates incentives for self-censorship and directly undermines the ability of journalists and human rights defenders to conduct investigations and build and maintain relationships with sources of information.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking the following reliefs:\n\nA DECLARATION that monitoring of WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people is inconsistent with the principles of legality, necessity, and proportionality and amounts to threat and infringement on the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press guaranteed under sections 37 and 39 of Nigeria Constitution, 1999; Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and Articles 17 and 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendants budgeting N4.87bn of public money to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, and text messages of Nigerians and other people is unlawful and a violation of the rights to private and family life, access to correspondence, and freedom of expression and the press\n\nAN ORDER setting aside the budget line of N4.87bn to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people for being inconsistent and incompatible with constitutional provisions, and international human rights treaties\n\nAN ORDER mandating the 1st Respondent to redirect public funds in the sum of N4.87bn budgeted to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls and text messages of Nigerians and other people to improve the working conditions of healthcare practitioners and improve public healthcare facilities across Nigeria\n\nAND FOR SUCH FURTHER ORDER OR ORDERS that this Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "Human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore has said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s regime mobilised armed thugs to disrupt the #EndSARS protest which was organised by young Nigerians last year.\n\nThe protest was organised to seek an end to police brutality, among other demands.\n\nHe stated this in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday.\n\nSowore condemned the hypocrisy of Nigerian leaders who have asked youths to desist from organising a protest in honour of the victims of the #EndSARS protest, citing alleged plans by hoodlums to hijack the protests.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari\u2019s regime conveyed thugs in government-registered vehicles to attack peaceful protesters, leading to the death of some of the demonstrators.\n\nHe further said the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave out air-conditioned BRT buses to the hoodlums to invade a protest venue last October.\n\nThe post reads: \u201cThroughout the #EndSARS protests in October 2020, the Muhammadu Buhari regime mobilised well-armed thugs to attack unarmed #EndSARS protesters here in Abuja, they were ferried around in Government registered vehicles, some of them mobilised through Jabi Park, they injured and even killed two peaceful protesters.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos, Gov. Sanwo-Olu gave out official air-conditioned state-owned commercial BRT buses to thugs to attack #EndSARS peaceful protesters camped at the Lagos State House of Assembly, when they didn\u2019t succeed, they mobilised the HQ Nigerian Army to shoot and murder innocent #Endsarsprotesters at #Lekkitollgate, that global terrorism carried out against innocent young Nigerian citizens by Muhammadu Buhari, Jide Sanwo-Olu and then Chief of Army Staff Yusuf Tukur Buratai led to the untimely but brutal deaths of many.\n\n\u201cNow the same government is claiming they are worried about \u2018hoodlums hijacking\u2019 the #EndSARSmemorial.\n\n\u201cMuhammadu Buhari, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and DSS (Department of State Services) men accompanying hoodlums are the real HOODLUMS! #RevolutionNow #BuhariMustGo.\u201d\n\nBuhari had in the past claimed last year\u2019s #EndSARS protest against police brutality was aimed at removing him from office.\n\nHe added that those who participated in the protest have made Nigeria unattractive to investors.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered last year when there was the #EndSARS protest. You remember the young people that wanted to march here and remove me?\n\n\u201cTell the young people to behave themselves and make the country safe, then we can attract real investors to the country,\u201d he had said during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nThe #EndSARS protest, which was held between October 8 and 20 last year, was a public outcry for an end to police brutality, extrajudicial killings, extortion and abuse of power, especially by officers of the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nThe protest, which started peacefully, led to the disbandment of SARS by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe protest was brought to a halt on October 20, 2020, when officers of the Nigerian Army shot at the protesters, killing and injuring some of them at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos.\n\nThis year, the Nigeria Police have threatened to quash any protest held in memory of the victims.",

The presidency has directed that Nigerians exposed in the reports be investigated, those with knowledge of the directive have told this paper.\n\nThe newspaper learnt that the EFCC communicated the invitation to Mr Obi during the week and he has been asked to report at the agency\u2019s Abuja headquarters on October 27 to face investigators.\n\nSources separately said the invitation is in connection with revelations in our Pandora Papers report. The report exposed how Mr Obi incorporated offshore holdings, which he did not declare to the Code of Conduct Bureau when he served as a governor and how he continued to manage his Next International UK Limited 14 months after becoming a governor. In addition, he also continued to operate a foreign account as a governor.\n\nAll these actions, which had been secret until our report, were in contravention of Nigeria\u2019s laws on code of conduct for public officers, PREMIUM TIMES reported.

          "text": "\u2026..Expands scope of nonprofit Revolving Loan Scheme to women\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation NGO, under the auspices of Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has called on government at all levels to end food insecurity through the empowerment of rural women.\n\nThe group also advocates the inclusion of indigenous women, in enhancing agricultural and rural development, and eradicating rural poverty.\n\nThe President and Founder of the NGO, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made the call in a statement on Friday as part of activities to mark 2021 International Day of Rural Women IDRW, which is marked every 15th Oct to celebrate rural women all over the world.\n\nShe said this year\u2019s International Day of Rural Women with the theme: Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All\u201d was in line with the ongoing programmes being carried out by the Helpline Foundation in recent times aimed at encouraging access to food and addressing hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\n\nDr. Ahmadu, while drawing the attention of the government at all levels to rural women\u2019s plights in Nigeria, added that providing training and empowerment for rural women was in line with Helpline Foundation\u2019s plans of cushioning hardships associated with their environment.\n\nAhmadu said: \u201cOct 15th is set aside for the marking of the IDRW, the essence of the event is to create awareness on the rural women and their plights in FCT and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that rural women and girls play essential roles in food systems in Nigeria\u2013 from production, to processing, preparation, consumption, and distribution of food \u2013 as well as in securing household and community nutrition. Yet, unequal power relations between women and men in the household and society, discriminatory gender norms and practices, prevalent violence against women and girls, and their disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, result in unequal access to food and heightened experience of hunger, malnutrition, undernutrition, and food insecurity across the country.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year being Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All , was as a result of neglect to the rural women by the policymakers, as the government does not remember them. So this awareness creation will make the government remember them, because they have a lot at hand, including problems of the upbringing of their children, among other things they are helplessly tackling.\n\n\u201cIt will surprise you to know that in some communities, they are treated unfairly and there is nobody to assist them. So for that, we are beckoning on the government at all levels to consider the widows in their policy-making. We are appealing to all the governments to consider and include them in their budgets. If this our appeals are considered, it will go a long way.\u201d\n\nOn the part of the NGO, she said \u201d We have so far embarked on periodic training and empowerment to the rural women annually across some selected communities in the six area councils of the FCT and suburbs.\n\n\u201cWhy we train and empower them is to enable them to cope with the harsh economy all over the world. Some of the rural women organisation that benefited from our empowerment programmes includes Yeyedu women, Bwari women and Kurudu women.\n\n\u201cAlso the Foundation has given out the none-profit Revolving Loan Scheme for women in our rural communities ongoing for the past 7 years respectively, where over 1000 have benefitted.\n\n\u201cAs you know, they don\u2019t have anybody to assist them, and the only way out is to train and empower them. We have trained about 1000 of them and after that, we gave them starter packs and advised them to be industrious and prudent in the management of their resources.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries of the ongoing training, Mrs Maria Afiniki, confirmed that she learned a lot through the training and was also empowered, even as she tasked the government to support genuine NGOs to assist rural women.",
          "summary": "The group also advocates the inclusion of indigenous women, in enhancing agricultural and rural development, and eradicating rural poverty.\nThe President and Founder of the NGO, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made the call in a statement on Friday as part of activities to mark 2021 International Day of Rural Women IDRW, which is marked every 15th Oct to celebrate rural women all over the world.\nShe said this year\u2019s International Day of Rural Women with the theme: Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All\u201d was in line with the ongoing programmes being carried out by the Helpline Foundation in recent times aimed at encouraging access to food and addressing hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\n\u201cThe theme for this year being Rural Women Cultivating Good Food for All , was as a result of neglect to the rural women by the policymakers, as the government does not remember them.\nSome of the rural women organisation that benefited from our empowerment programmes includes Yeyedu women, Bwari women and Kurudu women.",

          "text": "As part of renewed efforts to intensify and improve on development in the country and the Niger Delta Region, in particular, the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs has constituted a Committee to coordinate the harmonization of the various Operational Development Plans in the region into a single coherent Regional Development Strategy.\n\nMinister of Niger Delta Affairs Sen.Godswil Akpabio who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Babayo Ardo, officially inaugurated the committee recently in Abuja.\n\nDr. Babayo explained that this has become imperative considering President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s concern and interest to bridge the huge gaps between resources invested in the region vis-a-vis the infrastructural human and economic development recorded over the years in the area. The president, he said, therefore charged the Ministry on the harmonization of the development plans.\n\n\u201cThe two major plans developed with the assistance of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to support the Ministry in coordinating development and implementation some years ago include the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Regional Development Master Plan and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs (MNDA), Niger Delta Action Plan.\n\n\u201cSuccessive efforts by other stakeholders in the region also led to the initiation of other existing development plans. Therefore the multiplicity of plans, absence of standardization and failure to manage the plans led to poor delivery of those plans and their expected outcomes,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cIn actualizing the Presidential directives an initial study of the existing plans was carried out by a consultant engaged by the Ministry. This process produced a strategic document for the development of a united single plan for the region, which would be adopted as a working document for the committee,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile urging the committee to take the assignment very serious, he outlined the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the committee among others to include, reviewing the initiating framework for the Harmonization of the Development plans in the Niger Delta Region into a single coherent Regional Development Strategy.\n\nAlfred Abah, Director Planning, Research and Statistics in the Ministry, will chair the Committee, which is expected to enhance government efforts to achieve the desired development in the region. Membership of the committee is drawn from the Ministry and the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC.\n\nIn his reaction, the Chairman of the Committee while soliciting for the support of the Ministry and NDDC, assured the Permanent Secretary that the Committee does not have any reason to fail.\n\nHe said the committee would start by setting out a work plan and time line, which will produce the desired result and would not hesitate to co-opt any of the directorates when the need arises.",

Now that non-kinetic efforts are paying the dividend, how do we integrate that into the society,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou have to talk about justice for the victims, justice for even the perpetrators of the crimes. Remember that it is not everybody that is in Boko Haram that deliberately entered Boko Haram. In those days, they capture towns and coerce people into it.\n\nREAD ALSO: EFCC Grills Rabiu Kwankwaso\n\n\u201cSo the level of participation in their nefarious activities varies from one individual to another. Therefore, there should be a clear cut, system or process that will distinguish between those that committed heinous crimes and those that were coerced.\u201d\n\nNorthwest and central Nigeria have for years been plagued by heavily-armed gangs called bandits who raid villages, kidnap residents and loot and burn homes.\n\nMilitary operations are ongoing in the region, with the army saying it had \u201cneutralised\u201d scores of bandits, but attacks have continued.\n\nAuthorities suspended telecommunications last month in Zamfara, where most of the attacks take place, and parts of Katsina, Sokoto and Kaduna states, to disrupt the criminal networks.\n\nSince late last year, bandits have increasingly turned to mass kidnappings of school children.\n\nSimilarly, Boko Haram jihadists also launched an attack last month on the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) militants on the Nigerian side of Lake Chad, ISWAP\u2019s bastion, seizing a strategic island, according to fishermen and a security source.\n\nSince the death of Boko Haram\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau death in his Sambisa forest enclave, ISWAP has been fighting Boko Haram remnants who have refused to pay allegiance.\n\nHundreds of Boko Haram members have also since surrendered to the army along with families and children.\n\nMore than two million people have been displaced by Nigeria\u2019s conflict since it began in 2009, and the violence has spread over the borders to Niger, Chad and Cameroon.",

          "title": "500,000 People at Risk of Starvation in Nigeria\u2019s Northeast, UN Says",
          "text": "The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that half a million women, men, and children in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states are at risk of starvation as its funding for the region dries up.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the global agency, which seeks a $55 million urgent lifeline, said it might soon be forced to cut food rations except it secures urgent funds to continue its life-saving operations in the crisis hotspot.\n\nThe region has been a mainstay of insurgency attacks for over a decade and the situation has been worsened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising high food prices, the WFP said.\n\nThe UN agency also said the number of internally displaced persons surpassed two million in September.\n\n\u201cCutting rations means choosing who gets to eat and who goes to bed hungry. We are seeing funding for our life-saving humanitarian work dry up just at the time when hunger is at its most severe,\u201d said Chris Nikoi, WFP\u2019s Regional Director for West Africa, following a recent visit to Nigeria.\n\nThe WFP director said that current food security analyses showed that 4.4 million people in the North-east did not know where their next meal would come from, adding that more than one million children were already malnourished.\n\nHe cited continued attacks on communities by non-state armed groups, harsh and lean season conditions amid an economy dealing with the fallout from the COVID-19, as portending great danger for the people.\n\nNikoi added that high food prices and a severe reduction in household purchasing power had also contributed to a bleak outlook for the most vulnerable people in the North-east, warning that despite increasing needs, WFP may soon be unable to sustain life-saving operations in the conflict-riddled region.\n\nHe stated that the cuts would come just as severe hunger reached a five-year high in the country, in the wake of years of conflict and insecurity, noting that the situation had been worsened by the socio-economic fallout from COVID-19, high food prices, and limited food supply.\n\nHe added that the number of internally displaced surpassed two million in September 2021, reaching another grim milestone.\n\nNikoi warned that if at least $ 55 million was not received in a matter of weeks, WFP would have no choice but to cut food rations and reduce the number of people it serves, where assistance is already prioritised for the most vulnerable as early as November.\n\nThe WFP, which won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 2020, said it required at least $55 million in a matter of weeks to avoid cutting food aid.\n\n\u201cOur food assistance is a lifeline for millions whose lives have been upended by conflict and have almost nothing to survive on. We must act now to save lives and avoid disruptions to this lifeline,\u201d Nikoi added.\n\nHe said that the number of Internally Displaced People (IDP) forced to flee their homes in search of safety in the North-east had been rising steadily, reaching a new all-time high of over two million in September 2021.\n\nThe United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said cutting food assistance \u201cwill be a painful decision for humanitarians as it will negatively affect children, women, and men uprooted from their homes due to continued violence.\n\n\u201cAs we call upon our partners to step up their support in response to the growing needs, I would like to say thank you to those who have stood with us over the years in providing the much-needed humanitarian assistance in the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to its statement, the WFP said it has \u201cprovided life-saving food and nutrition assistance to severely food insecure people, displaced families in camps, and to vulnerable people living in host communities thanks to generous contributions from Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and private donors.\n\n\u201cThis year, relying on the continued generosity of donor partners, WFP ramped up its response to address rising food insecurity and the impact of COVID-19, targeting 1.9 million displaced people in Nigeria with life-saving food assistance.\n\n\u201cTo sustain humanitarian operations in the North-east Nigeria until March 2022, WFP urgently requires $197 million.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "text": "The United Kingdom government has warned its citizens in Nigeria against visiting 12 states in the country over possible terror attacks.\n\nThe advisory from the UK through its Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) followed concerns on the possibility of terrorists carrying out attacks in Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement published on its website \u201cstill current at October 16, 2021,\u201d it expressed concern over protests and a heightened security presence in major cities due to the trial of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe foreign government also urged its citizens to monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings.\n\nThe UK listed the Nigerian states as: Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara.\n\nOther states are: Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River.\n\nThe FCDO also advised against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto and Kogi aand within 20kilometres of the border with Niger in Kebbi State, and Abia State.\n\nIt also cautioned UK citizens against travelling to the non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers states.\n\nAccording to the advisory, events to mark the one year anniversary of #EndSARS protests are likely to take place nationally, week commencing October 18.\n\n\u201cThere may be protests and a heightened security presence in major cities such as Lagos and Abuja. In parallel, the high profile trial date of a separatist leader is also scheduled for 21 October in Abuja. There may be additional protests and a heightened security presence in Abuja and in the South-east for this reason. In all areas affected, you should monitor local media, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings,\u201d the advisory stated.\n\nFCDO noted that from September 3, 2021, the Nigerian government had mandated for all telecommunication operators in Nigeria to stop extending services to Zamfara State.\n\nThis, according to the FCDO, includes a suspension of all mobile telecommunications, including WiFi.\n\nIt added that a number of other state governments, including Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger had also implemented a partial shutdown of telecom services.\n\n\u201cSince 9 August, there has been an increase in protests and demonstrations in the South-east region of Nigeria. Protests, including \u201cStay at Home\u201d protests, are likely during October in the South-east region. There have been reports of violence during Sit-at-Home protests previously. You should monitor local media, avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings and follow any instructions from local police and security forces,\u201d the advisory explained.\n\nIt noted a number of attacks and targeted killings in the South-east and South-south regions, including in the states of Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Imo, Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo and Ebonyi.\n\nAccording to the FCDO, some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations.\n\nIt, however, added that there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas.\n\n\u201cThere is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews,\u201d the advisory added.\n\nEjiofor Alike",

          "text": "Melbourne, which has spent more time under COVID-19 lockdowns than any other city in the world, is set to lift its stay-at-home orders this week, officials said on Sunday.\n\nBy Friday, when some curbs will be lifted, the Australian city of 5 million people will have been under six lockdowns totalling 262 days, or nearly nine months, since March 2020.\n\nAustralian and other media say this is the longest in the world, exceeding a 234-day lockdown in Buenos Aires.\n\nWhile coronavirus cases keep rising in Victoria state, of which Melbourne is the capital, the state\u2019s double-vaccination rate is set to reach 70% this week, allowing for the ease in restrictions.\n\n\u201cToday is a great day,\u201d said Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews in announcing the lockdown. \u201cToday is a day when Victorians can be proud of what they have achieved.\u201d\n\nWhen hospitality venues and some businesses reopen, their capacity will remain heavily restricted. More easing, including the reopening of many retailers, will come once 80% of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated \u2013 estimated by Nov. 5 at the latest.\n\nOn Sunday, Victoria recorded 1,838 new coronavirus cases and seven deaths. Neighbouring New South Wales, which emerged last week from a 100-day lockdown, reported 301 cases and 10 deaths. Eighty percent of the state\u2019s people have been fully vaccinated.\n\nAustralia, once a champion of a COVID-zero strategy of managing the pandemic, has been moving towards living with the virus through extensive vaccinations, as the Delta variant has proven too transmissible to suppress.\n\nThe new strategy makes lockdowns highly unlikely once 80% of the population is fully vaccinated. As of the weekend, around 68% of eligible Australians have been fully inoculated.\n\nAustralia\u2019s health officials said on Sunday that quarantine-free travel from New Zealand\u2019s South Island, where there is no outbreak, will resume on Wednesday. The government is also in discussions with Singapore about reopening travel between the two countries for the fully vaccinated.\n\nDespite the rise in cases in recent months, Australia\u2019s coronavirus numbers are low compared to many other developed countries, with just over 143,000 cases and 1,530 deaths.\n\nNeighbouring New Zealand, which is also learning to live with COVID-19 by accelerating inoculations, reported 51 new cases on Sunday, 47 of them in the largest city Auckland, which has been in a lockdown since mid-August.\n\nOn Saturday, New Zealand vaccinated more than 2.5% of its people as part of a government-led mass vaccination drive.",

          "text": "Contrary to the claims by many Nigerian leaders that the unity of the country is non-negotiable, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, has declared that the unity of Nigeria is negotiable.\n\nGovernor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has however stated that what the country needs at this moment is a detribalised leader with a large heart to accommodate the diverse interests of the people.\n\nSpeaking Saturday at The Sun Newspaper Awards for 2020 held in Lagos, Kingibe however said even the union between a husband and wife is negotiable.\n\nThe accomplished diplomat further stated that any part of Nigeria that wants to pull out of the country should be advised to think about the implications of leaving Nigeria and what will happen to its landmass.\n\nHe reminded separatists that the land they reside would not be carved out and taken to anywhere in the event of their leaving Nigeria, pointing out that the land would remain where it is.\n\nKingibe, who received the newspaper\u2019s \u2018Lifetime Achievement Award,\u2019 called on Nigerians to learn to respect one another.\n\nHe pointed out that he recorded all his achievements as a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cI was born in Nigeria. I was groomed in Nigeria. I believe in Nigeria. People of my generation believe in Nigeria. We have no doubt about the fact that we have no option, but Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, I think that a few of my colleagues believe that the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable. Of course, it is negotiable. Even the unity of a family is negotiable. Even the constitution of husband and wife is negotiable. The moment either parties feels this union is no longer bearable, that he or she will rather go his/her way. You help them to sit down consider their condition after a careful and rational examination of the pros and cons of how to be married that they take the decision which suit them best.\n\n\u201cIt is enough just to say I do not farewell where I am. So, I am going,\u201d Kingibe explained.\n\nHe, however, added that any party that wants to pull out from the union should consider the implications.\n\n\u201cAre you sure where you are going? Are you sure of the consequence of where you are going? Do you really feel that the grass is greener on the other side? If you do, sit with your partner in respect, in mutual respect, in love if possible, but without demonising your husband or your wife because you will always remain the ex of the other person. But discuss quietly so that even if you separate in the future you can inter-relate with love and respect,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking specifically on the issue of those agitating to leave the country, Kingibe said: \u201cWhen we ever say we want to go away, I do not think they realise the going away. It is not that you carve out the piece of land, take it up and put it in other side of Ghana. The piece of land will be here. You will be here. Everybody will be here. And we all want to prosper. My appeal to everyone is, please, let us be respectful of one another. Let us not demonise one another. Let us respect the views of everybody,\u201d he noted.\n\nKingibe hailed a former Governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for creating a platform that would enable this dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe awardees are from everywhere. I listened carefully to the remarks made by the awardees before me. Two of them from the South-east ended their remarks by saying, I \u2018believe in one Nigeria.\u2019 I presume, it is a reflection of the fact that they achieved whatever they did because they are Nigerians. We can all achieve our goals in Nigeria. We are only part of a greater entity, be it ECOWAS. ECOWAS is one part of a greater entity called Africa and Africa exists in a globalised world.\n\n\u201cWherever you go, you will remain a Nigeria, an ECOWAS citizen, an African citizen or a global citizen. So, please, let us mind our language as we address national issues. Whatever I achieved, I stood on the shoulders of great people, many of whom have deserted us, but without them, I cannot be what I am today,\u201d Kingibe explained.\n\nTambuwal: We Need a Detribalised Leader\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Tambuwal of Sokoto State has stated that what Nigeria needs at this moment is a detribalised leader with a large heart to accommodate the diverse interests of the people.\n\nTambuwal stated this when the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Ayokunle Samson Olasupo, paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House in Sokoto.\n\nIn a statement by Tambuwal\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Muhammad Bello, the governor argued that no one or group of people, no matter their religious affiliation or tribe can arrogate the leadership of Nigeria to themselves to the exclusion of other parts of the country.\n\nTambuwal noted that the leadership of the country is mutually complementary, adding that Nigeria belongs to every Nigerian and that no one will send anyone out of the country hence the need to remain together for the betterment of the country.\n\nThe Sokoto State governor insisted that the kind of leadership the country needs will understand the issues of diversities and is inclusive in his approach to governance, without tribal or religious sentiments.\n\nPointing out that both Islam and Christianity have been coexisting even before the union of the country came into existence, Tambuwal also added: \u201cthose who know history said Christianity and Islam belong to the same root,\u201d stressing that \u201cJerusalem and Damascus\u201d were examples of places where the two religions are being practised side by side.\n\n\u201dThere is need for us to continue practising the teaching of the two religions as ordained by God,\u201d he said, emphasising that \u201cif we go by the real teachings of the two religions, there wouldn\u2019t be friction or any reason to fight one another.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and the CAN President for their efforts in preaching peace and unity in the country, stressing that Sokoto State is home to every Nigerian, irrespective of religious, tribal, or ethnic differences.\n\nHe explained that in pursuance of this objective of unity, children of other Nigerians resident in the state who attend public schools are exempted from paying fees just as the indigenes of the state enjoy free education.\n\nTambuwal also added that in the area of health too, the state government\u2019s Zakkat and Waqaf Commission pays the medical bills of indigent Nigerians resident in the stateside by side those of the less-privileged state indigenes.\n\nIn his remarks, the CAN President, Olasupo said he was in the state to interact with the Sultanate, the government, and the people of Sokoto State to find ways to overcome the security challenges being faced in the country.\n\nCalling on Muslims and Christians to live in harmony, Olasupo condoled the people of the state over the loss of lives occasioned by the unfortunate incident of bandits\u2019 attacks in some communities of the state.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to the state government for its giant stride in providing security in the state.\n\nFestus Akanbi and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto",
