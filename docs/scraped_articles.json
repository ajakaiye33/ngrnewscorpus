          "title": "Laughter, fun at evening of tributes for Prof Femi Soyinka",
          "text": "Prof Femi Soyinka, a professor of Dermatology and younger brother of Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, died on June 14, 2022. PM News\u2019 NEHRU ODEH reports the evening of tributes held for him in Ibadan by his friends and relatives on June 30\n\nFamily, friends and colleagues of the late Femi Soyinka, a professor of dermatology, venereology and clinical immunology, who was also the younger brother of the Nobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka gathered at Divine Grace Event Centre on New Ife-Ibadan Expressway in Ibadan on June 30 to pay a befitting tribute to the deceased. The late Femi passed on Tuesday, June 14, aged 85 years old, at his home in Kukumada village, Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nDear ones came from all walks of life, near and far gathered at the event centre to give one lasting tribute tagged \u201cEvening of Tributes in Memory of Professor Femi Soyinka,\u201d a man whose sterling qualities and interventions went beyond borders. It was indeed a full house that birthed and gave reminiscences of memories and times of the late Femi, which elicited laughter as stories about the inevitable roles his wife, Kofo, played in his life surfaced again. Femi was, as the clich\u00e9 goes, a man who carried his wife and family along.\n\nThe tribute night was one to remember. It was filled with memories, tributes, songs, music, dance, emotions, nostalgia and fun. As the tributes went on, there were interludes of drama skits as well as oscillating performances intermittently.\n\nYinka Davies, the popular Nigerian soul singer and jazz musician as well as the Ibadan City Chorale group entertained guests in attendance with their spectacular solo and group performances respectively.\n\nDistinguished guests and family members did not just pay tributes to the late icon but also revealed the unique qualities of the man they were privileged to experience and interact with in their various kinship and professional interactions in the four scores and five years he strutted the earth.\n\nProfessor Wole Soyinka, Femi\u2019s elder brother who had a fleeting but notable presence at the event spoke glowingly about him in a speech entitled, \u2018The Secret Life of Baale Kukumada (As shared by his quite complicitous brother.)\u2019\n\nSoyinka shared with the audience the late Professor\u2019s undying love for domesticating animals, a pastime which was hitherto not public knowledge.\n\n\u201cIn the extensive backyard, spread beyond a walled off section that slopes down into a stream increasingly congested by external abuse, ducks, goats, sheep, turkeys, and other domesticates of the animal kingdom jostle until reporting time in the kitchen. Once he even kept geese, their aggressive motions tended to intimidate guests taking a stroll in the garden. Another time he experimented with the foreign cousin of our own \u2018aparo\u2019 \u2013 of which the partridge is the more familiar of the imported clan.\u201d\n\nLove for animals\n\nSoyinka also said his brother\u2019s fondness for animals also had something to do with the reason he initially wanted to study veterinary medicine. \u201cI was not in the least surprised by Femi\u2019s immersion in animal husbandry. His early ambition was to be a veterinary doctor. Few people know this. In fact, again if memory serves me right, he did enroll for a veterinary course, then decided to switch. I was part of the parental consultation and I was, frankly, rather lukewarm to the idea.\u201d\n\nSoyinka\u2019s intervention was confirmed by the late Professor\u2019s son, Ayodele who also, in his speech entitled, \u201cMy Professor of Many Things,\u201d referenced his dad\u2019s uncanny love for fishing, nature and domesticating animals. \u201cWe would go for hours on fishing trips especially on Sunday mornings. It started at Opa Dam on the Ife campus with mum in town though she later escaped for reasons I never bothered to ask. But I suspect it might not be unrelated to the dinghy that deflated in the middle of Opa Dam.\n\n\u201cOn trips, we caught nothing, which in his view was because the fishes had gone to church. He convinced me that the best thing was to find other lucky fishermen, buy their catch and pass it on to mum as the result of our hours of hard labour. We rarely spoke while fishing because he said it drove the fish away.\n\n\u201cThere were some exciting experiments like when he tried to raise a baby antelope and we had to feed it with milk out of a feeding bottle. The antelope eventually died. There was the monkey he bought but Mrs Accomplice in a rare turncoat manner seemed not to be in support and it had to be returned. I think there was also a failed attempt to bring a donkey down from the north. I am not sure what led to that never happening,\u201d he said.\n\nAyodele was later filled with emotions when he spoke to his father directly, thanking him, among other things, for the way he lived his life. \u201cI honestly thought I was prepared for your death but I have just discovered that the bond between a wonderful parent and child is not easily severed,\u201d he said, making a momentary stop in his speech.\n\nFemi\u2019s wife\n\nDr Kofo Soyinka, medical practitioner and Femi\u2019s wife described her husband of 46 years as a good family man. Partly, she said, \u201cSimple but urbane. Femi is mischievously witty, kind, very hardworking, with uncommon integrity, an excellent cook and a very considerate person. He loved nature. He loved humanity and he strove to protect humanity in all its various manifestations.\u201d\n\nDr Olaokun Soyinka, Femi\u2019s nephew, former Commissioner for Health in Ogun State and son of the Nobel Laureate, described his uncle as unassuming, hardworking and a lover of humanity. \u201cI remember Uncle Femi as a smiling, jovial, hard working doctor who spent his life serving the underserved people of Africa.\u201d\n\nOlaokun also said Femi never joked with his wine. \u201cMy uncle, like his elder brother, appreciated good wine and had a well-stocked cellar. On the occasions I would visit him at home, where Aunty Kofo would feed us sumptuously. It was always a major negotiation to persuade him to release a bottle of red wine for us to accompany the meal with.\n\n\u201cThough he pretended we would have to make do with the cold beer, he would always relent as we insisted that our digestive process would be greatly enhanced by a tasty dose of wine. He would then disappear (he did not trust anyone else to enter his cellar) and reappear with a nice bottle. With his infectious grin, he would raise his glass and we would end the meal with a pleasant tipple.\u201d\n\nMrs Adenike Adeyanju-Osadolor, a publisher and Kofo\u2019s long-time friend who worked with Femi for two years when she supported him administratively to run ICASA 2005 in Abuja also spoke endearingly about the man she described as her boss and \u201cfriend-in-law.\u201d He was happy-go-lucky, humorous, a gentleman to the core and respectful to all.\n\n\u201cEven though he was much older than me, he never called me by my first name. I was always Mrs O to him as many in the office called me. He would use the respectful Yoruba \u2018e\u2019 rather than \u2018o\u2019 to address me and sometimes threw in \u2018Yes ma.\u2019 I always found it difficult to determine whether he was serious or was being his usual mischievous self. He was humility personified,\u201d Adeyanju-Osadolor recalled.\n\nLuis Armand Bodea, ICASA Director/SAA Coordinator, described Femi as a giant, a visionary leader, a true Pan-Africanist who valued African soil and its people. \u201cHe gave his all to humanity and built a legacy for generations to come. Prof. Femi, you gave me your all, you taught me how to fight with dignity and stand firm as a proud African. You were a great man with a brilliant brain and your impact and contribution towards Africa\u2019s response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic is valued all over the world.\u201d\n\nProfessor Omofolabo Ajayi-Soyinka, Femi\u2019s younger sister, entitled her tribute, \u201cMy Brother: Some Vignettes of Memories.\u201d She began her speech with a rhetorical question, \u201cHow do I begin the story of a relationship that started more than 70 years ago, long before my consciousness formed from the memories in my mind? Had iphones or smartphones been in existence then, my dear brother, you would have no doubt captured every second of the forever-to-be-cherished mundane moments that you shared with me. Nonetheless, we had quite a bit after my consciousness formed.\n\n\u201cMy brother, Femi, I would celebrate you eternally for the legacies you left behind, your love of family, your compassion for people, your love of simple, beautiful life. Above all, the unique and comfortable relationship you allowed me to have with you. I am grateful for these memories and anytime I feel low, I will roll out the memory camera of my mind and I will smile.\u201d\n\nRoll out the memory camera? Yes indeed, as speakers after speakers recounted in cinematic manner Femi\u2019s sterling, endearing qualities, qualities that will forever be etched in their memories.\n\nThe brilliant closing remarks, which Femi\u2019s son, Ayodele gave at the close of proceedings, told the knell of an unforgettable evening filled not just with vivid memories of a life well lived but also nostalgic feelings and laughter.",

          "text": "The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria on Tuesday assured all stakeholders that none of the intending pilgrims for the 2022 Hajj from Nigeria would be left stranded.\n\nThis is just as it said it has so far transported 29,128 pilgrims and 920 officials in 73 flights into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria quoted the Assistant Director, Public Affairs of NAHCON, Mrs Fatima Usara, as disclosing this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nUsara spoke at a time indication emerged that about 1,300 Kano State intending pilgrims may not perform this year\u2019s Hajj following the inability of the Azman Airline to airlift them.\n\nHowever, Usara said most of the pilgrims had been moved to Makkah in preparation for Arafat slated to take place on July 10.\n\nShe said, \u201cFrom the private tour operators, 8,620 visas have been processed and about 7,000 of the intending pilgrims are currently in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIn addition, NAHCON and leadership of Association of Hajj and Umrah Operators in Nigeria assure that all licensed tour operators pilgrims will be flown out of Nigeria before 12 midnight on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe rescue operation will be conducted in Abuja, Lagos and Kano states. FlyNas will provide three aircraft, while Kam Air, another Saudi Airline, has been contacted on standby in case there is need to deploy another aircraft.\u201d\n\nShe said the management of NAHCON and AHOUN leadership urged affected pilgrims to assemble at the agreed location for screening and consequent conveyance to Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage. NAN reports that no fewer than 43,000 Nigerian pilgrims registered through the 36 states and Federal Capital Territory and licensed tour operators are expected to partake in this year\u2019s hajj in Saudi Arabia.\n\nInvestigation by The PUNCH, however, revealed that only 1,386 out of the 2,686 intending pilgrims from Kano State had so far been transported to the Holy land for the holy pilgrimage.\n\nAccording to the investigation, out of the 1,300 stranded intending pilgrims, 86 had yet to get visa as of time of filing this story.\n\nHowever, speaking to journalists on Tuesday on the situation, the Executive Secretary of Kano State Pilgrims Welfare Board, Alhaji Abba Dambatta, said so far, Azman Air had airlifted 1,386 pilgrims while the remaining 1,300 were still on ground.\n\nHe, however, assured all that no pilgrim would be left behind.\n\nHe said the board encountered many obstacles as it initially settled for Max Air to airlift all the pilgrims from Kano only to be overruled by NAHCON, saying \u201cwe are to work with Azman Air, which we rejected at the initial stage.\u201d\n\nDambatta, however, revealed that since the resolution of the board with Azman Air to continue with the Hajj exercise, it has so far carried out five trips to the Holy land.\n\n\u201cThe first aircraft transported 399 pilgrims, the second batch was 97, the third batch was 95, while the fourth batch had 395 and the final batch had 100 pilgrims on board,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, the General Manager of Azman Air, Alhaji Suleiman Lawan, said they are on top of the situation.\n\nHe said they have since communicated to NAHCON on their inability to airlift all the Kano pilgrims to the Holy land and promised to provide two more big aircraft to help evacuate the stranded pilgrims.\n\nMeanwhile, not less than 150 intending pilgrims from Oyo State will not be performing the 2022 Hajj due to visa denial by the Saudi authority.\n\nThe Chairman, Oyo State Pilgrim Welfare Board (Muslim Wing), Prof Sayed Malik, disclosed this while addressing journalists on Monday in Ibadan.\n\nAccording to him, the denial of visa to the affected intending pilgrims by the Saudi authority at the 11th hour was based on the recommendation of NAHCON.\n\nHe explained that 629 out of 43,000 slots given to Nigeria was allocated to Oyo State to perform the 2022 Hajj despite the fact that over 1,000 Muslims had already registered to perform the hajj.",

He killed her.\u201d\n\nShe was pronounced dead later that day.\n\nMamman is said to have been born in Okene, Kogi State, and qualified as a doctor in Nigeria in 1965. But he has worked in the UK since 1991.\n\nThis is not the first time he will be coming under the cloud of controversy.\n\nThree years earlier, Mamman was said to have carried out the same procedure on a 64-year-old man who suffered a cardiac arrest the same day. Although he survived, he is left permanently disabled and suffering from mobility problems.\n\nAlso, the court heard that his \u201ctrue age\u201d is a matter of contention as his birthplace in Nigeria has no system of birth registration.\n\nDuring his medical training, Mamman was said to have given a date of birth of September 16, 1936, which meant that he was 21 years old when he began his medical training and 81 at the time of the fatal hospital incident.",

          "title": "Wike rejects one-on-one parley with Atiku over crisis The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Abuja; Emmanuel Badejo and Success Omonijo\n\nThere is no end in sight to the festering crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the choice of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate by the presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nYesterday, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike ruled out the possibility of a one-on-one meeting with the presidential flagbearer.\n\nHe said Atiku should engage his team for peace talks on the terms proposed to the party, particularly the resignation of the national chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu.\n\nAlthough the Board of Trustees (BoT) Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin, had suggested that Atiku should lead a reconciliation team to Wike, who also contested for the presidential ticket at the primary, the governor indicated that he would rely on the advisory from his \u201cStrategy Team\u201d.\n\nIt was learnt that emissaries have traced Wike to Turkey where he was on vacation while Atiku\u2019s lobbyists were said to have offered Petroleum Minister\u2019s portfolio to him, if Atiku is elected in next year\u2019s election.\n\nAlso yesterday, a BoT member, Waziri Adamu, suggested that Wike should be appointed as Director-General of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation.\n\nA source said Wike, who has returned from Turkey, has foreclosed a one-on-one meeting with Atiku, citing lack of faith in any personal agreement with the candidate, instead of reconciliation talks with Atiku by his team.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThere is no likelihood of Wike having one-on-one private discussion with Atiku. Shortly after the primary, the governor had a side meeting with Atiku in Abuja and nothing was adhered to.\n\n\u201cHe was shocked that Atiku has not told Nigerians what transpired between him and Wike after the primary and how he arrived at Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as a running mate.\n\n\u201cSince there was no full disclosure, Wike has directed that fresh talks with Atiku should be with his strategy team members, who will come up with an advisory for him.\u201d\n\nWike\u2019s strategists include Governors Seyi Makinde (Oyo) and Samuel Ortom (Benue); ex-governors Hassan Dankwambo (Gombe); Ayodele Fayose (Ekiti) and Donald Duke (Cross River), among others.\n\nOn what transpired between Atiku and Wike, the source said: \u201cYou can also crosscheck what I will tell you from the camp of the ex-VP. Following the euphoria of winning the primary, Atiku visited Wike to seek his support,\n\n\u201cHe promised to make him a vice presidential candidate. Wike said he does not want the office, but that Atiku should consider ex-Governor Donald Duke. Atiku and his supporters prevailed on Wike to be his running mate.\n\n\u201cThere was much pressure on Wike to agree to the offer. A 17-man committee was also set up by the leadership of the party and 14 of the 17 members recommended Wike as Atiku\u2019s running mate.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership later raised a kangaroo committee (with Ayu as a member), which claimed that the party can only recommend three candidates to Atiku to pick. And it was obvious to Wike and his team that there was a predetermined candidate.\n\n\u201cYou can see the lines of insincerity and lack of faith to talks. This explains why Wike shut his doors against Atiku.\n\nHowever, Atiku is still said to be hopeful about reconciliation with Wike.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that five items may dominate Atiku\u2019s interaction with Wike and the outcome of the parley may determine the fate of PDP and its chances in 2023.\n\nThe factors include the following:\n\nExplanation by Ayu and Atiku for abandoning the recommendations of a search committee for vice presidential candidate;\n\nRestructuring of the party, including the removal of the national chairman,\n\nAdherence to power rotation between the North and South,\n\nIntra-party inclusion and\n\nOffers on the table for Wike\u2019s camp if Atiku wins the presidential poll.\n\nA former governor said: \u201cThe crux of the matter is that Atiku\u2019s camp has not made significant offers to assuage Wike and his group. The only thing on the card was a proposal to make Wike the Minister of Petroleum Resources if Atiku is elected.\n\n\u201cThis infuriated Wike who said a ministerial appointment was not far-reaching. He said he had been a minister before and he is not aspiring to be a minister.\n\n\u201cInstead, Atiku and his men have been cleverly working on a winner takes all formula in a party where everyone is equal.\u201d\n\nPDP considers Wike for DG of Atiku\u2019s campaign team\n\nBoT member Adamu, who admitted PDP was battling with internal crises, assured that the party was making efforts to amicably resolve them.\n\nHe lamented that it was unfortunate that some chieftains have not transited from the position of aspiration to candidature.\n\nWaziri, a former Minister of Police Affairs said: \u201cOur party is not in disarray as the news media is making Nigerians to believe.\n\n\u201cOur party has its challenges but our party is contended. And we are living in some comforts. Why because there is no political decision you take without ripple effects.\u201d\n\nHe countered Governor Samuel Ortom, who claimed that 14 of 17 members of the committee on running mate voted for Wike.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was no total truth in the claims by Ortom. I was part of the committee and I can tell you that there was no voting whatsoever for any of the nominees.\u201d\n\nWaziri said stakeholders would do everything to broker a truce.\n\nHe suggested that the Rivers State governor should be appointed as the DG of Atiku\u2019s campaign team.\n\nHe said: \u201cGovernor Wike will be a good DG and should be offered that position. He won\u2019t refuse to work with Atiku. I know him to be a man of his word.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the candidate has the right to choose his running mate.\n\nWaziri said: \u201cThat committee recommended three people to the candidate who reserves the right to choose any one of them or none at all.\n\n\u201cThere was no voting at all, but members of the committee were allowed to express their views.\n\n\u201cThe candidate reserves the right at the end of the day to choose his running mate.\n\n\u201cThe PDP has had a history of what happened between 2003 and 2007 where there was a deep-seated crisis between the President and the Vice President and nobody wants a repeat, hence the candidate who won the election on his own merit must be given the right at the end of the day to make a choice on who will be his running mate, not the party.\u201d\n\nThe former minister said since the candidates have emerged, members of the party should put their differences behind and forge ahead.",

          "title": "VP slot: Tinubu, Obi rev up efforts to meet July 15 deadline",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPolitical parties yet to submit names of their vice presidential candidates have stepped up efforts to beat the July 15 deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe parties affected, it was learnt, have been working round the clock and putting finishing touches to their consultations to ensure names they submit would be acceptable to major stakeholders to forestal controversy after their announcement.\n\nMultiple sources told Daily Sun that stakeholders in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Labour Party (LP) were particularly being careful not to make the same mistake of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which is being threatened by implosion since the announcement of its vice presidential candidate.\n\nA highly placed member of the APC said the party was between \u2018the Devil and the deep Blue sea\u2019 over the religious faith of the running mate to its standard bearer, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nHe said even at the time of writing this report, the ruling party was yet to take a final stand on it despite speculations that Asiwaju Tinubu had settled for a Muslim/Muslim ticket.\n\nOur source said though major stakeholders around the APC presidential candidate feel that Muslim/Muslim ticket appears to be the best option, they were also scared of a backlash from Christians across the country.\n\nHe, however, confirmed to Daily Sun that the APC candidate would name his running mate on or before Friday.\n\nAPC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi,... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video APC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi, 9 others\n\nAlso, indications emerged that the LP is also digging in to conclude on the choice of running mate to its standard bearer, Peter Obi.\n\nA top member of the party also confirmed to Daily Sun that getting a suitable running mate to complement the rising profile of Obi had been a major headache to power brokers in the party.\n\nHe said the situation was compounded by the collapse of the alliance talks between the LP and New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) and the rejection of Senator Musa Kwankwaso to take the offer of a running mate to Obi.\n\nOur source, however, said the LP has already concluded on an appropriate running mate for the LP candidate and would announce his name on Friday, July 8.\n\nThe APC and the Labour Party earlier submitted pseudo names as presidential running mates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to beat the deadline issued by the INEC.\n\nWhile the presidential candidate of the APC, Tinubu, picked Kabir Ibrahim Masari, Katsina politician as a placeholder for his running mate, Obi submitted Doyin Okupe as his running mate.\n\nMeanwhile, barring last minute hitch, LP would name and unveil the substantive vice presidential candidate on Friday.\n\nSpokesman of the National Consultative Front (NCFront), Dr. Yunusa Tanko, told Daily Sun, yesterday, that the Labour Party Campaign Organisation has consulted widely and would unveil its vice presidential candidate on or before Friday July 8.\n\nThis is as he confirmed that talks with the Kwankwaso-led NNPP failed because the NNPP presidential candidate wanted Obi to serve as his vice presidential candidate, a development he described as unacceptable to LP.\n\n\u201cWe are building a big tent, we want to build a crossbreed political formation, we are doing what is called constructive consultation, and I want to put it on record that the Labour Party Campaign Organisation, which is mandated to speak on the vice-presidential candidate said that the talks on looking for a running mate has been concluded and between now and Friday the name of the vice-presidential candidate will be unveiled to the public. The issue we are going through now is discussions with those who want to join the party, but we have gone beyond an alliance with NNPP, we are now talking about unveiling the vice-presidential candidate of LP before the end of Friday by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nFormer national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Victor Umeh, has revealed that talks between LP and NNPP collapsed on June 15.\n\nThe former APGA national chairman and senatorial candidate on the LP platform, who spoke on a television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday, condemned Kwankwaso for creating the impression that talks between both parties was ongoing.\n\nHe said the LP was no longer interested in every other discussion with NNPP.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised at the recent media blaze by the members of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) to continuously suggest that they were locked in a negotiation with the Labour Party to have a partnership or arrangement where the two parties will work together in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised to continuously see this, we had this discussion precisely on the 15th of June, more than three weeks ago. What necessitated the meeting was that the NNPP and LP working together will give a better opportunity for the presidential election to be won. And the two parties set up two teams.\n\n\u201cIt was on the 15th of June that the whole talks collapsed completely. The Labour Party has averted its mind from every other discussion with the NNPP.\n\n\u201cBut these fellows have continued to give the impression that they are still in talks with the Labour Party. We couldn\u2019t agree on the knotty issue of who becomes the presidential candidate.

          "title": "Ejike Okoye: Thriving in the World of Film and Business \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "For US-based seasoned Nollywood actor, Ejike Okoye, storytelling and making a positive impact on society remain the driving factor for his desire to become an actor. In this interview with MARY NNAH, the actor, who also doubles as a businessman, shared how he has successfully balanced his passion for his first love-acting and his venture into car importation and general merchandise\n\nWhat new project are you working on presently?\n\nI\u2019m currently working on two new projects: \u201cShadow of America\u201d and \u201cChinelo\u201d. Both stories are great and life-touching. \u201cShadows of America\u201d is another Nollywood USA diaspora blockbuster advocacy film aimed at fighting the serious menace of abuse/violence against immigrant women. It is a true-life story, well-acted and directed by the best of Nollywood USA cast and crew. It is a must-watch for everyone.\n\nWe stopped working on Shadows of America due to the coronavirus pandemic but we are back on it now. You would see yourself in both movies because they depict our everyday life in the United States and Nigeria. They are movies that have never been made.\n\nThey were shot with one of the best super quality equipment in Nollywood today. They are highly intriguing and a must-watch. I want to thank the Newyork Film Academy director, Obed Joe, for allowing me to be part of these fantastic movies. I also want to thank the other cast and crews for a job well done.\n\nAside from acting, what else do for a living?\n\nI import motor vehicles and general merchandise. I thank the CEO of C TO C customs bonded terminal in Emene, Enugu for being there for me. It is a very reliable and trusted terminal. They were very supportive of my business. I ship a container load of vehicles and goods through their terminal and they always make sure that I am satisfied without cutting corners in clearing my merchandise.\n\nI am business inclined by nature. I have had the opportunity to climb different mountains with different views at a time. I started climbing the same mountain over and over thinking the view would change. There was a time in my life I was not in a great place mentally so I decided to go back to climbing different mountains and grow for a better Ejike Okoye.\n\nThat has helped me a lot. Every day is a work in progress. I am yet to get to where I want to be but I give God the whole glory for the journey thus far.\n\nWhen did you decide that you wanted to become an actor?\n\nIt came naturally. Storytelling and making a positive impact on society remain the driving factor for my desire to become an actor. When I was younger I admired legends like Arnold Schwarzeneger, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Dolph Lundgreen among others, and always thought about being like them someday.\n\nMy physical appearance and my style of dressing made me stand out among my peers whenever I attended auditions and it helped to secure roles that have to do with action and stunts. Acting those small hitman roles in movies effectively turned people, especially my peers into a captive audience.\n\nMy love for storytelling turned into a passion for acting. I have taken a few turns since then but the heart of what I do and what fuels me every day is showcasing true-life stories. A lot of inspiration came from watching action movies as a little kid. I wanted to be like those actors I watched in movies in the early 1990s.\n\nHow was it when you started?\n\nIt was a bit challenging but one thing about me is whenever I decide to do something I give it all I have without looking back. If you are offered a seat on a rocket ship, don\u2019t ask what seat, just get on.\n\nWhen I first started, the pay was not good as I envisaged. It\u2019s what we referred to as peanuts but that did not discourage me because I had a goal. I focused on doing the best I can, sharpening skill sets, building relationships, and positively impacting the industry and fans. I added value outside of my roles like extraordinary stunts to my roles which helped me to negotiate my future in the industry. I was driven by impact, not money in other words, fame before money.\n\nGrowing up, I had dreamt of becoming an actor or a model, and today I can fortunately say that I am living that dream even as I work to develop a network in the industry.\n\nWhat are some of the difficulties of the acting business?\n\nWe face a lot of difficulties that our government has turned a blind eye to. We lack good roads for easy navigation of shooting locations. An inadequate power supply such that we have to keep using generators on locations and the noise from generators affects our movie audio that the editor would work harder to clear up the background noises.\n\nThe most difficult part is the insecurity that has plagued our nation, particularly the southeast where we shot most of our movies. We can\u2019t move freely from one location to another due to fear of being kidnapped, robbed, or even killed.\n\nPiracy is another beast that needs to be tackled because it kills the industry. Also, we need to find better ways to market our movies, especially across the world.\n\nWe need government intervention in the industry. We can\u2019t tackle all these issues on our own. All these and some other factors negatively affect movie production. Be as it may, every day I\u2019m inspired to do my part to take the industry to the next level, particularly Nollywood U.S.A.\n\nHow would you rate Nollywood then and now?\n\nJerusalem was not built in one day. Nollywood progresses every day. Nollywood then was great to me in the sense that we were like families working together to achieve a common goal. There was decency, humbleness, respect, and love.\n\nWe had great stories to showcase \u2013 stories that brought families together and enemies resolve their differences after watching Nollywood movies. Parents watched Nollywood movies with their children in their family room because there wasn\u2019t that much nudity in our movies then. Families connect themselves to our stories because they were mainly based on true life events.\n\nNollywood of today is a lot different. There is too much disrespect, hate, opprobrium, disdain, scorn, ridicule, and mockery among artists. There is so much nudity that parents no longer watch our movies with their kids; too much disconnection between artists and crew members; disconnection in stories.\n\nI don\u2019t see unity like it was in Nollywood then. Nollywood of today has improved tremendously in the area of movie production and quality. We use more advanced equipment now that our movies go a long way across the world.\n\nNow you can watch our movies on Netflix, Amazon, Xfinity cable, and other U.S cable networks and special effects are superb now. Most importantly Nollywood then organised seminars and workshops where artists were trained at no cost but in Nollywood today everything costs money.\n\nHow do you unwind?\n\nThis is another important aspect of life. We should take time off from work and business to rest and relax. Most importantly, spend quality time with family. I take vacations seven to eight times every year with my family.\n\nSome are long while some are weekend getaways. I also do other things to relax like working out, swimming, taking long walks, watching movies, and more.\n\nWhat advice would you give young ones going into acting?\n\nBe prepared to take your \u201cscrappiness\u201d to a new level \u2013 The entertainment industry is built on relationships and growth can sometimes be achieved based on referrals. Expect to hustle like you never have before. Prepare your mind to give your all every day and network with as many people as possible to grow your visibility within the industry.\n\nStart with the end in mind \u2013 Your entertainment career is a marathon, not a sprint. Visualise what you want and create a list of goals and experiences you desire to have along your career path. Look at your list often to remind yourself why you want this and to stay motivated.\n\nBe open and explore career paths \u2013 There are hundreds of jobs in the industry. Do your research and take the time to explore careers that interest you by shadowing professionals, conducting informational interviews, and reading industry trade magazines & blogs daily to stay informed.\n\nThere are too many departments in the entertainment industry like location manager, production assistant, production manager, director of photography, makeup artist, and editor to name a few; so one can venture into one of those career paths as we don\u2019t know what destiny has in stock for you.\n\nJoin professional organisations and resource groups \u2013 There are amazing organisations that exist for minorities in the entertainment business. By investing in a membership, you gain access to a community of professionals who are ready and willing to help you achieve success at every level of your career.",

          "title": "Bridging the Gap for Electrical, Electronic Engineers to Thrive \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Egbin-Ikorodu branch, is bridging the gap between its members and the International Electro-technical Committee to ensure that codes and standards are set for engineers to thrive. Funmi Ogundare reports\n\nPricked by the need to proffer solutions to the many challenges confronting the country and ensure that engineers share ideas with a goal to developing codes and standards, mentorship training, career progression, among others, the Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( NIEEE), Egbin-Ikorodu branch, recently, held its inauguration and investiture ceremony, themed, \u2018Sustainable Development and Energy Generation in Nigeria\u2019.\n\nThe move is aimed at bridging the gap between its members and the International Electro-technical Committee (IEC) to ensure that codes and standards are set for electrical engineers to thrive.\n\nIt was also an opportunity for the Nigerian Society of Engineers ( NSE) of the branch to commemorate its 20th anniversary titled, \u2018The Iron and Steel Industry and Nigeria in the 21st Century.\u2019\n\nSpeaking at the inuaguration ceremony, the chapter Chairman, Sunday Oluwagbenga Akinbode, noted that the creation of the chapter, will not only foster growth, knowledge and idea dissemination, it will also ensure that electrical and electronics family waxes stronger in the country.\n\nHe said a lot of its members are poised to move the institute forward and solve some of the challenges inherent in the community, adding that with its codes and standards, it will be better positioned and purpose-driven.\n\n\u201d We must as a matter of urgency, reinvest our knowledge into revamping the thirst for engineering purpose-driven solutions and also these solutions must be channeled through the appropriate political corridors for accelerated implementation which could rescue Nigeria from its current economic abyss,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told THISDAY that though some of its members have fear of being disenfranchised because of the HND/B.Sc dichotomy, the body of electrical engineers have been able to allay the fear.\n\n\u201d We have the ideas and we want to tap into those ideas to move the institute forward and associate with other associations within the field of engineering so that the codes and standards that we emphasize, can trickle down to members for them to be better focused.\u201d\n\nAkinbode stated that there are lots of policies set on the national level and many of them will be passed during the upcoming International Conference and Exhibition on Power and Telecommunications ( ICEPT) that will be held in Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of practice and untapped resources. We are moving towards being chartered and we are not limiting it to electric, but also other offsprings of engineering. That is why we are going down to the grassroots and also sensitising students. There are a lot of people with fantastic ideas. Everything is backed by Physics, \u201cthe chairman stressed.\n\nThe National Chairman of the institute, Micheal Akan said it\u2019s cardinal focus is on the IEC standard and standardisation, adding that it also given itself a target of having a chapter in every part of the federation and will even increase it to 29.\n\nHe emphasised on the importance of research and development at the institute, saying that it has commited N10 million into it.\n\n\u201d As engineers, we need to talk with facts and figures and know what is happening in the value chain rather than trading blames.\u201d\n\nChairman, Board of Directors, Ikeja Electric PLC, Mr. Kola Adesina, called on engineers in the country to activate their intellect to produce the change in the power sector that Nigerians desire to see through innovation and scientific method.\n\nHe expressed concern that the country is not generating enough gas regularly and that our plants are not working at fullest capacity, adding that Nigeria is also making so much money in the area of oil and gas, but not in power generating.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhy are we not generating gas regularly? Why are our plants not generating at fullest capacity? Why are the distribution companies not recieving enough power. We are making so much money in oil and gas, but actually not in power. We have commited over a billion dollars into this.\u201d\n\nHe said since humanity appreciates the contribution of engineers and scientists, they should activate their value to solve the power problem confronting the nation rather than point accusing fingers on government and individuals.\n\nIn his lecture titled, \u201d Sustainable Development and Energy Generation in Nigeria\u2019, the General Manager ( Lagos Region), Transmission Company of Nigeria ( TCN), Olugbenga Ajiboye emphasised on why there had been collapse of the national grid, saying that there is no agreement between the transmission and distribution companies.\n\n\u201cThere is no concrete agreement between the sector which NEC is trying to make possible by signing an agreement. In a situation where one partner defaults, there is bound to be a system collapse especially when you cannot match the generation with the distribution consumption, there will be deficit of power or imbalance. It will result into frequency swinging or dwindling.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the generating and transmission companies must fulfill their obligations which should be binded by law, adding, \u201cby that sequence, the consumption will balance the generation and there will be minimal disruption to it. We have a legal will to it which the regulator is working on.\u201d\n\nAjiboye however, listed some of the challenges affecting electricity availablity in Nigeria to include, insufficient gas supply, inadequate infrastructure, ageing equipment, liquidity issues, overloaded transmission network, civil unrest among others.\n\nAt the 20th anniversary celebration of NSE, a special lunching of NSE Egbin-Ikorodu ultra modern secretariat building fund and bus projects, were held.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the branch, Bashiru Mohammed said in the last 20 years, inspite of numerous challenges, it has emerged as the best branch of the NSE as far as energy sector is concerned.\n\nHe acknowledged the contributions and support of past and present members towards the professional growth and development of engineers.\n\nIn his key note titled \u2018 The Iron and Steel Industry and Nigeria in the 21st Century\u2019, the Chairman, KAM Holding Limited, Dr. Kamoru Yusuf, who was represented by his Executive Director, Mr. Bola Awojobi called on the federal government to come up with a policy statement mandating each state in Nigeria including the FCT to invest in captive/ on- grid generation of a minimum of 100MW using coal or gas fuel, adding that production facilities consuming up to 30MW should also be mandated to generate its own power using coal or gas as fuel.\n\nAccording to him,\u201d Is this policy feasible? No. Let us forget it, but if yes, let us go for it. The policy will contribute towards grid stability and incessant drop in power generation.\u201d\n\nAside just locating all steel factories in Lagos and Ogun States only, he also stressed the need for the federal government to pay special attention to the critical infrastructure of gas pipeline supplies to other states.\n\nAwojobi who is also the chairman of Basic Metal, Iron and Steel and Fabricated Metal Products sectoral group of Manufacturing Association of Nigeria ( MAN), said, \u201d private investors in the iron and steel industry in Nigeria, cannot continue to use scrap metals to produce liquid steel. Our level of industrialisation cannot generate enough scraps as a major raw material to meet the national demand for liquid steel production.\n\n\u201d Nigerians must invest in exploration of solid minerals, mining and beneficiation of mined materials to meet minimum standard for further processing to secondary raw materials.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, the President of NSE, Tasiu Salad Gidari- Wudil disclosed that the society plans to open an innovation hub ( Smart office) that will impact young engineers, adding it will be done at its secretariat in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe need to support our members as part of our objectives to develop their talents. Most times, our colleagues do research work, but to actualise it, becomes a big task because they do not have the enabling environment to do that and government are not supporting in that area.\n\n\u201cSo we have decided to do that ourselves. At our headquarters in Abuja, we are dedicating a whole floor where we will have the smart office which will house an innovation centre and showroom where products produced by our members are going to be displayed for investors.\u201d\n\nAsked if Nigerian engineers are innovative enough to push out their products, he said, \u201cthe NSE is an international society. We have 86 branches and 27 divisions, out of which four are outside Nigeria. Three are in the UK. Nigerian engineers are working , are inventing and they are professors in the universities all over world and they are flying our flags.\u201d\n\nHe said the NSE will concentrate on trainings that will emphasise entrepreneurship for its members, adding that it has started incorporating it in its curriculum.\n\n\u201d The engineer is good in invention, but not good in how to sell their invention. A lawyer can come pick their products and sell it faster than the engineer, so the engineer has to be trained on the best way to market his products. So we are encouraging our members to imbibe entrepreneurship,\u201d Gidari-Wudil said.\n\nThe programme witnessed the presentation of awards to people who have impacted the society on one way and another.",

Abdulkadir Abdullahi,\n\nRepresented by the Deputy Majority Leader, Hon. Peter Akpatason, the Speaker observed that the House also mandated the Committee not to restrict its findings to the NNPC records alone, but to liaise with experts in the industry, transport workers and all other stakeholders to determine an independent finding for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\nHe cited sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) which gave the House powers to inquire into the conduct of affairs of any person, authority, ministry or government department charged, with the duty of or responsibility for executing or administering laws enacted by the National Assembly\n\nTribune reports that during the hearing, the attention of the House was drawn to the lingering cases of fuel scarcity causing significant loss of manhour and untold hardship on Nigerians; controversies and concerns generated over the huge sums of money being paid as oil subsidies and the inaccuracy of data required for effective planning, supply and distribution of the premium motor spirit (PMS), also known as petrol.\n\n\u201cOnly last week, the news was awash with the trading of blames between the NMDPRA and IPMAN over bridging the gap as a result of the rising cost of IPMAN\u2019s operations, reportedly to the tune of over N70 billion in the interim, to address the lingering fuel scarcity. See Also Sahara Reporters Tell Emefiele He Has To Come \u2013 House Speaker, Gbajabiamila Walks Out Representative Sent By Embattled Central Bank Governor\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly in the repeal and re-enactment of the Year 2022 Appropriation Act has projected the cost of subsidy for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) to be over N4 trillion.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the House of Representatives has constituted and mandated the Ad-hoc Committee on the volume of fuel consumed daily in the country, to engage the key operators in the sector, so as to leverage on your expertise and experience in the industry and come up with a solution or template required for effective planning, supply and distribution of the premium motor spirit (PMS) in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that the amount being expended on fuel subsidy as reeled out by the apex bank and NNPC on the fuel subsidy is doubtful and has been contested by concerned stakeholders, the Speaker frowned on the failure of all the accounting officers to honour the invitation of the Ad-hoc Committee.

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

Emeka Ajene co-founded Gozem alongside Raphael Dana in 2018.\n\nAmong the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria, there\u2019s a proverb that says: \u201cWhat was secret is revealed in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThanks to a variety of experiences across African markets over the last decade, I\u2019ve become privy to a number of earned insights regarding innovation-led businesses across the continent.\n\nBuilding a super app for Francophone Africa\n\nIn 2018, I moved to Lom\u00e9, Togo to bring my various experiences to bear in service of a singular opportunity: building a super app for Africa, starting in Francophone Africa.\n\nAfter four years of advancing this vision alongside an exceptional team, I am pleased to share that I have transitioned from day-to-day management & operational role to a strategic advisor role at Gozem.\n\nFrom the earliest days of traversing the streets of Lom\u00e9 in search of informal sector motorcycle taxi drivers amenable to a quick sales pitch, to our series A fundraise and our recently announced partnership with the International Finance Corporation, to bringing to market what\u2019s now truly Africa\u2019s super app \u2013 one which operates a variety of verticals across Togo, Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon, generates multi-million USD GMV, employs hundreds of team members across West & Central Africa, and positively affects the lives of many thousands of drivers, vendors, & other partners on a daily basis \u2014 the journey has certainly been personally and professionally fulfilling.\n\nSo rather than recount past successes or detail the varied contributions of Raph, Greg, Jean-Martial, Gr\u00e2ce, C\u00e9cilia, Lionel, Manfreed, Pierrick, and many others over the years, here are some useful lessons, peppered with Igbo proverbs, I learned along the way.\n\n\u201cProverbs are the oil with which words are eaten.\u201d \u2013 Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart (1994)\n\nGozem Team. Image source: Emeka Ajene\n\n1. Culture is a function of leadership\n\n\u201cWhen the mother goat chews her cud, her child watches her mouth.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOrganizational culture is a funny thing. Everyone generally agrees upon its importance, at least in theory \u2014 \u2018culture eats strategy for breakfast\u2019 and so on \u2014 but in practice, at the earliest stages of company building, there are many other pressing (and more tangible) issues that steal attention.\n\nAcross African markets where the innovation economy is still nascent and some positive aspects of Silicon Valley-style management aren\u2019t widely-adopted (yet?); it is easy for startups to fall into locally familiar paternalistic, hierarchy-driven cultures where most \u2013 or all \u2013 decision-making comes from authority.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s not uncommon to find that managers are put (or put themselves) on an unwarranted pedestal. (See, for example, the recent conversation around hostile work cultures across the Nigerian tech ecosystem spurred by Damilare\u2019s expos\u00e9 in TechCabal.)\n\nBut often, the highest and best use of authority by company leaders isn\u2019t to simply show power, but to create and empower internal leaders.\n\n2. Talent development is a differentiator\n\n\u201cKnowing but not telling is what kills old men. Hearing but not heeding is what kills young men.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAttracting talent is a challenge for all organizations, and doubly so for early-stage companies. Newer organizations often lack the prestige, ability to pay, and perception of job security (/\u2018deriskification\u2019) that more established businesses enjoy. And for startups operating in African markets, the talent challenge is compounded by the relative lack of depth within local talent pools.\n\nStartups across the African continent must intentionally and aggressively build their talent development muscle. There needs to be a real answer to this question: \u201cHow do we rapidly upskill junior staff and systematically prepare them to grow in the company and take on new challenges?\u201d\n\nOne specific and unorthodox initiative that we undertook at Gozem was to identify promising drivers on the platform and offer them salaried roles within our operational teams. While in some sense this may be cannibalistic as it often takes the best drivers off the roads, these driver ambassadors have a unique understanding of the Gozem platform and are often able to speak and lead certain driver-facing functions in more credible ways.\n\n3. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it, and it\u2019s what gets understood\n\n\u201cThe voice that\u2019s used in quarreling is not the same voice that\u2019s used in making peace.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOftentimes, when I disclose that I moved to Togo to launch Gozem despite not speaking any French, people are shocked. But it\u2019s true, and the experience taught me valuable lessons about communicating effectively.\n\nThere is great difficulty involved in leading a team of people who speak a different language\u2013 a humbling experience to say the least. For me, among other things, it served as a forcing function for trust & deferential leadership \u2013 letting junior team members make contributions in important discussions with external counterparties.\n\nIn Gozem\u2019s early days, after a few miscommunication-linked mishaps, I began sending a daily morning narrative email in French (translated via DeepL) that highlighted priorities of the day and key recent wins & opportunities for improvement.\n\nWhile oral communication certainly has its place, well-thought-out written business communication can improve comprehension, eliminate misunderstandings, and provide organization-wide clarity \u2013 it\u2019s one reason to take Amazon\u2019s business writing culture seriously.\n\nParaphrasing Jeff Bezos, \u201c[written communication] forces better thought and better understanding of what\u2019s more important than what, and how things are related.\u201c\n\n4. When you have leverage, use it\n\n\u201cIf a snake fails to show its venom, children will use it to tie firewood.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nLeverage is a dynamic thing. You have it at one moment under certain conditions, but the next moment, conditions change and you lose it.\n\nIn negotiations, potential \u2018adversaries\u2019 \u2014 employers/employees, founders/investors, business partners, etc \u2014 are often driven primarily by self-interest, so the ability to recognize where the leverage lies at a given point in time can be very valuable.\n\nTo win, one must develop a long-term and non-zero-sum viewpoint. Nonetheless, it\u2019s advisable to exploit identified leverage. While there\u2019ll likely be future consequences if a hand is overplayed, more often than not, unused leverage becomes a source of regret.\n\n5. Systems lead to success\n\n\u201cWhen a group of people expects things to be done by others, nothing is done.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBest-selling author James Clear wrote, \u201cWe don\u2019t rise to the level of our goals; we fall to the level of our systems.\u201d By this, he means that achieving successful outcomes requires consistent faithfulness to enabling processes. And while his book primarily focuses on individuals, I find the same is true for organizations.\n\nIt\u2019s why many of the world\u2019s leading innovation-led organizations use operating/management systems \u2014 the most popular tend to be EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), Scaling Up, and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)\n\nAt Gozem (thanks largely to the influence of Kevin Colas), we began implementing the Scaling Up method two and a half years or so into our journey. Since then, we\u2019ve seen significant gains in terms of accountability, clarity of expectations, and cross-functional visibility.\n\n6. Become a big fish by dominating smaller ponds\n\n\u201cDrop by drop is how the palm wine fills the container.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\n\u201cWould you rather be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?\u201d\n\nFor businesses with venture-scale ambitions, markets matter. So the only answer is to play in a big pond \u2014 one with a clear path to becoming a big fish.\n\nAt Gozem, while we\u2019ve always maintained a big fish-big pond vision since day one, our initial geographic market was Togo, a country with a population of just 8 million, and our initial focus was on the ride-hailing vertical. It\u2019s no surprise that many viewed us quizzically, with many questions about the strategy of playing small initially.\n\nA relevant French expression that I learned during my time in Togo is \u2018Petit \u00e0 petit, l\u2019oiseau fait son nid\u2018 \u2014 little by little the bird builds its nest.\n\n7. Embrace constraints & learn quickly\n\n\u201cHot soup should be sipped carefully.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAccording to Howard Stevenson, an entrepreneurship professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, \u201centrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled.\u201d And, as alluded to in point 6 above, at the early stages of new ventures, it seems there are never enough resources: not enough time, not enough talent, not enough capital, and so on.\n\nConstraints often inspire better thinking, compel creativity, and force focus and (ruthless) prioritization. In many cases, this leads to quick iteration and rapid learning of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and what truly moves the needle. And when a winning formula is found, constraints push you to fully exploit the opportunity and develop a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n\nRead: Marissa Mayer\u2019s \u201cCreativity loves constraints,\u201d \u2014 a book she penned while at Google.\n\n\u201cit is often easier to direct your energy when you start with constrained challenges\u2026or constrained possibilities. \u2026 Limited investment makes it easier to move on to something else that has a better chance of success.\u201d \u2013 Marissa Mayer.\n\n8. Resilience should be a core organizational trait\n\n\u201cA palm nut that wants to become palm oil must pass through fire.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAll businesses have to be resilient of course, but when comparing my experiences in the West to those across sub-Saharan Africa, I\u2019d say that resilience \u2014 the ability to recover quickly from sudden disturbances and adapt easily to misfortune \u2014 is much more necessary in African markets where extraneous shocks are much more common.\n\nDuring my time in Togo, Gozem experienced its share of unforeseen external bad luck, from office flooding to power outages to regular connectivity disruptions and more. Still, the exercise of planning is essential and robust processes to respond to the unplanned are recommended.\n\nWhile I love the Mike Tyson quote, \u201ceveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,\u201d getting punched in the mouth is far from uncommon in a boxing match and one should certainly be prepared to respond.\n\n9. Character, reputation, and integrity are everything\n\n\u201cNot everyone who answers to the title Chief is a legitimate chief.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOne of the most famous scenes in the critically acclaimed TV series The Wire involves ruthless crime lord Marlo Stanfield (played by Jaime Hector) exclaiming, \u201cMy name is my name!\u201d\n\nFor founders and managers of young ventures, your name is your name. Said simply, reputation matters.\n\nAs much as we\u2019d all like the freedom to be individuals, startup leaders (and business leaders in general) represent more than themselves; they represent employees, investors, and other significant stakeholders. How they\u2019re perceived among different groups \u2014 potential customers, partners, investors, etc. \u2014 can often have a real business impact, like it or not. Call it the penalty of leadership in today\u2019s connected age: \u201c[Leaders] must perpetually live in the white light of publicity.\u201d\n\nAnd in low-trust environments such as African markets, my view is that this is doubly important. Both on the individual and institutional levels, it\u2019s important to always act with integrity, deliver on promises, and avoid doubt-inducing controversies.\n\n10. As you build a business, the business builds you\n\n\u201cThe right hand washes the left hand, the left hand washes the right hand.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBuilding a business is a process of discovery. You discover who your customers are and what they need and will pay for. You discover the products and services that best meet those needs. And you discover how to sustainably and profitably meet those needs.\n\nSo there\u2019s customer and market discovery, product discovery, and business model discovery, but one thing not talked about enough is self-discovery \u2014 throughout the entire process one learns and discovers things about her/himself.\n\nIn early-stage ventures, founders and early employees, at the least, tend to be unusually invested in a company\u2019s ups and downs, its peaks and valleys, its daily mishaps and milestones, and they learn things \u2014 about markets, management, and more \u2014 that ultimately shape their worldview. The intensity of the experience often brings with it earned insights that can last well beyond the lifetime of one\u2019s involvement with the business.\n\nHere, I\u2019m reminded of two quotes that I\u2019ll let speak for themselves.\n\nThe American Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, \u201cThe mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\u201d\n\nAnd Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with the quote, \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\u2019s not the same river and he\u2019s not the same man.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The global tech company announced that it is hosting an interviewing event in Lagos for Software Engineering II from August 1 to 5. Candidates have to be open to relocating to the three countries to work in Amazon\u2019s Consumer Division.\n\n\u201cThe initiative is fundamental to Amazon\u2019s future and will provide intriguing problems in software architecture design and building highly scalable services,\u201d Amazon said on its site\u2019s job description page. \u201cWe are building extremely customer-focused software that can also serve many fast-growing businesses for decades to come. The project will have regular reviews with the company\u2019s senior leaders. The scope of the project is set to scale rapidly for the next few years post-launch.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s decision to turn its talent hunt searchlight on the Lagos tech software developer market threatens to exacerbate the talent war that has left many industries in Nigeria drained of their best workers.\n\nRead also: More Nigerian tech developers set sights on jobs abroad\n\nUnsurprisingly, Carbon\u2019s technical personnel celebration holds in the same week Amazon plans to interview the candidates. Dozie said \u201cno expense will be spared\u201d for good measure.\n\n\u201cThe management of Carbon, and we hope we speak for others, abhors this flagrant attempt to take advantage of the spirit of \u2018japa\u2019 to lure our unsuspecting youth, the future of this great nation, to lands that are devoid of heat, amala, and daily character-building challenges,\u201d Dozie said.\n\nNigeria has the third-highest number of software developers in Africa at 114,536 according to a report by Tunga.io. This means that there are 556 software developers available per million people. This is very low for a country with over 200 million people, and a 33.3 percent unemployment rate. One in every three Nigerians does not have a job.\n\nCalifornia with a population of 39 million has 628,414 software developers. South Africa has the largest number of software developers in Africa at 133,195 available for 69 million people. This represents 2,234 software developers per million people.\n\nThe talent shortage in Nigeria has become pronounced in recent years as the tech ecosystem expanded and many more companies across different industries adopt digital technology, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic that forced a new way of doing business. With the adoption of digital technology growing daily, the demand for tech talents has skyrocketed.\n\nRead also: Low investment in technical workforce slows Nollywood\u2019s growth\n\nHowever, the talent supply has not matched up to the growing demand. Local demand is also losing to rising foreign demand for local tech talents. Most tech talents have chosen to go remote due to the incentive of working for multiple clients and earning foreign currency. It, however, does seem that remote work is not working out for many tech workers largely due to the worsening Nigerian economy with its attendant inflation and a weak currency.\n\n\u201cWe thought remote work was now \u2018the thing\u2019. The way Nigeria is bleeding its tax base outside is alarming. Why not do stuff to make sure they (tech talents) remain by supporting Talent City Lagos and others; a dollar goes much further at home at N612,\u201d said Victor Asemota, board chairman of EdoInnovates.\n\nAlthough the global tech ecosystem is currently seeing a massive layoff of workers, with Meta, the parent company of Facebook, and others freezing hiring, Amazon appears not to be slowing down. However, experts say the company is being pragmatic by turning in Lagos for talents.\n\nThe tech company is not hiring senior engineers for a reason, said Gergely Orosz, a tech talent expert. By targeting junior engineers, Amazon is being sensible and not setting ambitious expectations, he added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re aware they\u2019re unlikely to find seniors, given the lack of big tech presence in Lagos just yet,\u201d Orosz said.\n\nAccording to him, Amazon\u2019s offer to relocate the software engineers it intends to hire from Nigeria is a rarity for below senior-level engineers. This could mean that Amazon is struggling to even hire junior engineers locally.\n\n\u201cRelocating from lower-cost regions with solid engineering talent at the Eng2 level could be a solid strategy for in-office companies in the future,\u201d Orosz said. \u201cAmazon won\u2019t do remote and likely struggles to hire locally. But this can be a win for those in Nigeria and for Amazon.\u201d",

          "title": "Need for CBN Intervention in ASUU Strike \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nNigerian educational system needs financial intervention including the ASUU strike. There is need for Central Bank of Nigeria intervention in ASUU strike. CBN has the financial capacity to intervene on the present ASUU\u2019s strike which has been a recurrence decimal in the Academic calendar of Nigerian students. The strike actions, mostly blamed on the government\u2019s non-implementation of agreement with the academic body, have disrupted the academic pursuits of most Nigerian students with an estimated 75 per cent graduating later than scheduled. In 2013, Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, declared a strike on December 17, 2013, which lasted 6 months over non-implementation of 2009 agreement between the union and the Federal Government. It was eventually called off after the federal government agreed to some demands of the Academic body.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has disclosed that it introduced no less than 37 intervention programmes to boost the economy of the country. There is need for CBN to include ASUU on its intervention list so that our children can go back to their various universities. It is therefore not surprising if the bank can also step in to salvage the nation\u2019s languishing education sector knowing that education is central to any development efforts.\n\nNigeria\u2019s budget for the education sector has averaged around 5.3 per cent of the budget which is in sharp contrast to the recommended target and continues to drop. From a GDP perspective, the figure paints an even more dismal picture, as the education sector accounted for 1.94 per cent of the real GDP in Q1 2021 and 1.86 per cent in 2020.\n\nAccording to data from UNESCO, about 76,338 Nigerians were studying abroad as of 2018, which is the highest recorded by an African country. From all indications, Nigeria\u2019s persistent level of underinvestment compared to global standards does not bode well for any effort towards improving the nation\u2019s human capital index, nor will it address the seemingly insatiable demands for foreign education.\n\nThe Nigerian education sector requires adequate funding as well as the willingness to build competitive value amongst its peers. CBN can intervene in ASUU strike at this critical crisis. It was perhaps in a bid to replicate the magic wand which has worked so well in transforming the Nigerian agricultural sector in the area of education, that the CBN under Emefiele delved into the education sector with different initiatives which if well implemented will place the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions among the top 100 tertiary institutions in the world.\n\nAmong these initiatives are the N63 billion Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Centres of Excellence in nine Federal Government owned universities across the country to enhance post-graduate studies in financial related courses and the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES) to train and finance entrepreneurship ideas of Nigerian university graduates.\n\nInaugurating one of the centres of excellence at Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria recently, the CBN Governor, Emefiele said that the project was part of the apex bank\u2019s intervention in education.\n\nHe explained that the centres would be delivered in phases and the first phase, which comprised the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, University of Ibadan and Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria had been completed and ready for use by the institutions.\n\nThe Director Corporate Communications Department, CBN, Mr Osita Nwanisobi has stated that currently, the bank has about 37 purpose-driven interventions that are functionally based, well-thought-out and born out of the critical issues within the economic space.\n\n\u201cWe know the issues of insurgency, insecurity, exchange pass through, issues of price adjustment in terms of power or fuel and others. All of these are parked together is what we are seeing as inflation today. That is also why CBN is doing massive intervention especially in agriculture,\u201d he said. Mr Nwanisobi who said that CBN is diversifying the economy to non-oil sectors to boost the economy of the country disclosed that CBN is intervening massively in agriculture to reduce inflation and create more jobs for our youths.\n\nIt goes without saying that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) under the leadership of Mr. Godwin Emefiele as governor, has impacted Nigeria\u2019s developmental strides more than any other in recent history of the bank. The apex bank\u2019s intervention programmes in various sectors of the economy including the creation of a N100 billion targeted credit facility; N100 billion health sector intervention facility, Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI), N1 trillion for the manufacturing sector and of course its legendary exploits in the agricultural sector through the Anchor Borrowers Programme, have all gone to show the commitment of the bank to the development of the country beyond monetary policy regulation.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, human capital development is integral to any country\u2019s sustainable development and poverty reduction goals. Critically, education and knowledge capacity building are critical drivers of human capital development.\n\nThus, investment in education is one of the bedrocks of society and helps determine the level of development recorded in an economy.\n\nThe value of education in an economy cannot be overemphasized, as it helps shape both individuals and the broader society, and forms a huge source of economic value.\n\nOver the years, Nigeria\u2019s education sector has suffered neglect of the worst order. In fact a review of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) data suggests Nigeria\u2019s educational sector has suffered massive capital flight in the last 10 years.\n\nSpecifically, using the CBN\u2019s balance of payment statistics, Nigerians have spent a hefty sum of $28.65 billion on foreign education between 2010 and 2020.\n\nNeedless to say that the high demand for dollars to pay these foreign educational institutions has affected the country\u2019s foreign reserve (which currently stands at $33.39 billion), and contributed immensely to piling pressure on the exchange rate.\n\n_______________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes via inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

          "text": "The government of Lagos State says it has since fired a customary court judge, Mr Ishola Razaki Adeyemi, who allegedly dissolved a marriage and snatched the wife of a complainant, Mr. Olayemi Ayeni.\n\nIn a viral video, Ayeni was seen narrating how Adeyemi, who allegedly had interest in his wife, dissolved their union and denied him access to his children.\n\nAyeni said when he protested, Adeyemi used police to arrest him and he was subsequently sent to Kirikiri Prison.\n\nHe said trouble started in his home when his wife started disrespecting him after he invested N5 million in her business.\n\nAccording to the complainant, the wife packed out of the house and rented an apartment close to him.\n\nHe said she had filed for divorce, which the magistrate granted and subsequently impregnated his wife.\n\n\u201cI had an issue with my wife, she moved out of the house, she rented an apartment very close to my house. I put five million naira into her business to establish a school, Greatest Kiddies Foundation. So the success of the business caused a problem in the family, I could not control her again,\u201d he said in a video currently circulating on social media.\n\n\u201cSo after ten months, I took her to court, thinking that I\u2019ll able to resolve this matter through Alternative Dispute Resolution. The judge, Dr Ishola Azakiq Adeyeni, hurriedly dissolved my marriage and got that woman impregnated three months after dissolution of the marriage.\n\n\u201cThe woman she\u2019s now carrying nine months pregnancy for that man. What really pained me is that in the ruling, this man denied me access to my children. That I can only see the children at the school premises once in a week. The same children now are under his custody, he took over the business I established for that woman, he denied me access from having access to my children, he impregnated the woman now and he still wants to send me to jail.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be under the custody of the man, instead allow my children to go and play at Sambisa Forest. I don\u2019t want my children to live in a chaotic environment that is why I\u2019m saying, I want my children back.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t care, the Lagos State Social Development can take over the responsibility of the children. I\u2019m financially okay, I can take care of my children. I can put them in boarding house, I want my children back. Fellow Nigerians, please assist me!\u201d\n\nBut reacting in a statement issued on Monday, Executive Secretary, Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, Titilola Vivour Adeniyi, said the case was investigated by the Lagos State Judicial Service Commission.\n\nAdeniyi said though the matter occurred between 2014 and 2015, the video was posted by Ayeni\u2019s friends in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the State Government has been drawn to a viral video circulating the social media space wherein one Mr. Olayemi Ayeni alleged that a former Customary Court Member, Mr. Ishola Razaki Adeyemi, abused his office by exhibiting unprofessional conduct in a customary court case involving the Complainant and his wife and proceeded to snatch his wife and children from him.\n\n\u201cThe matter which occurred between 2014/2015 was investigated by the Lagos State Judicial Service Commission. The findings of the investigation subsequently led to the termination of the appointment of the Member of the Customary Court.\n\n\u201cIt was discovered that the viral video was posted by \u201cOgbongefriends\u201d sometime in 2016. Members of the public are informed that the Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency has attempted to reach out to Ogbongefriends on their various social media accounts, but unfortunately their accounts have not been active since 2018. All efforts to reach out to the complainant have been to no avail.\n\n\u201cWe therefore use this medium to encourage anyone with useful information about the complainant to please reach out via our social media handles- @dsvrt on twitter or @dsva on instagram or on 0813-796-0048.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\nBy Abbas Bamalli\n\nTerrorists in Katsina have killed an assistant commissioner of police, ACP Aminu Umar, in an ambush in Dutsinma, Safana LGA, where a convoy of presidential advance team, going to Daura, was also attacked.\n\nIt was not clear whether the attack on Umar was the same reported by Presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu.\n\nIn an earlier statement, Shehu spoke about an ambush and a shooting incident near Dutsinma, against the Daura-bound convoy carrying President Buhari\u2019s Advance Team of security guards, protocol and media officers.\n\nThe team was expected to be in place in Daura and await Buhari\u2019s arrival on Wednesday, few days to Eid-el-Kabir.\n\n\u201cThe attackers opened fire on the convoy from ambush positions but were repelled by the military, police and DSS personnel accompanying the convoy.\n\n\u201cTwo persons in the convoy are receiving treatment for the minor injuries they suffered. All the other personnel, staff and vehicles made it safely to Daura\u201d, Shehu said.\n\nBut the spokesperson of the Police command in Katsina, SP Gambo Isah, said ACP Umar died in the ambush also in Dutsinma. .\n\nHe also said that another policeman died.\n\nIsah did not mention the President\u2019s advance convoy, but most possibly he and Garba may have been reporting the same event.\n\nIsah gave a more graphic account of the terror attack.\n\n\u201cToday, July, 5, 2022, at about 11:30 a.m, a distress call was received that terrorists numbering over 300 on motorcycles, shooting sporadically with AK 47 rifles and General Purpose Machine Guns, ambushed ACP Umar and his team.\n\n\u201cThe late Area Commander with members of his team were on clearance operation of recalcitrant bandits/terrorists, in Zakka forest, Safana LGA of the state.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Area Commander and one other, gallantly lost their lives during a cross exchange of gun fire,\u201d he added.\n\nIsah said that the Commissioner of Police, Idrisu Dabban-Dauda had expressed deep sympathy to the family of the deceased officers.\n\nHe also prayed God to grant the deceased abode in Jannatul Firdausi.\n\nThe commissioner reaffirmed the commitment of the police to the ongoing onslaught against terrorism in the state \u201cuntil it is completely routed out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Katsina State Government said bandits have burnt down two primary health centres in Batsari Local Government Area of the state.\n\nDr Shamsudeen Yahaya, the Executive Secretary, Katsina State Primary Health Care Development Agency disclosed this to newsmen on Tuesday in Katsina.\n\nAccording to him, 69 out of the over 1,800 healthcare centres in the state were also temporarily closed as a result of insecurity in some local government areas.\n\n\u201cMost of the health facilities in the area were taken over by the miscreants, and the solar refrigerators provided in such facilities have been converted to use by the bandits.\n\n\u201cThe affected primary healthcare facilities are located in different areas of Jibia, Safana, Batsari, Faskari, Sabuwa and other frontline LGAs of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nYahaya also said some of the health workers were kidnapped, but later released.\n\nThe agency\u2019s boss said the situation has increased request for redeployment by health workers in the affected areas.\n\nYahaya, however, said the government had concluded plans to renovate one health centre in each of the 361 wards across the state.\n\nHe also expressed the commitment of the government to complete the rehabilitation of dilapidated health centres in the state.\n\nYahaya said that the state government would recruit 272 health workers to tackle the problem of manpower shortage in the health sector.",

Bola Ahmed Tinubu took him seriously and reached out to those who ran with him in the Presidential Primary race. He reached out to them.\n\n\u201cWe too must act as adults if we are going to win everyone back. It\u2019s not right to keep repeating those words said in anger by our leader, Asiwaju.

We need EVERYONE OF OUR PEOPLE TO COME ON BOARD. Some are reluctant because we are still throwing those words in their faces, constantly.\n\n\u201cLike our leader, Asiwaju himself has done, reaching out to those he defeated, let\u2019s be magnanimous in victory by reaching out in a matured way to everyone we know.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing, anyway.

Central District Court in California has again postponed the sentencing of Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi, for the multi-million-dollar fraud charges.\n\nHushpuppi who pleaded guilty to the charges was arrested in Dubai, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) in June 2020, subsequently flown to the U.S., and was remanded in custody pending sentencing.\n\nJudge Otis Wright has fixed September 21 as the new sentencing date.\n\n\u201cAt the request of counsel, the Sentencing is CONTINUED to 9/21/2022 at 1:30 PM before Judge Otis D. Wright II, as to Defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas,\u201d the court\u2019s announcement made June 24 read.\n\nThe sentencing hearing was initially moved by Judge Wright from February 14 to July 11 and has now been moved to September 21 at the counsel\u2019s request.\n\nMr. Abass, in July 2021 agreed to plead guilty to the multi-million-dollar fraud charges filed against him by the United States government.\n\nHe has been in custody since his arrest in Dubai and rendition to the U. S. in June 2020.\n\nAfter initially maintaining his innocence, Mr. Abass made a volte-face, entering into a plea bargain agreement with the U.S. government in July 2021, in the hope of getting a lighter punishment.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to Count Two which is \u201cConspiracy to Engage in Money Laundering,\u201d an offense that attracts a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment among other punishments including full restitution, his plea agreement with the U.S. government states in part.\n\nDespite pleading guilty, Mr. Abass will not be exempted from paying restitution.\n\n\u201cDefendant understands that the defendant will be required to pay full restitution to the victim(s) of the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty.\n\n\u201cDefendant agrees that, in return for the USAO\u2019s compliance with its obligations under this agreement, the court may order restitution to persons other than the victim(s) of the offenses to which defendant is pleading guilty and in amounts greater than those alleged in the count to which defendant is pleading guilty,\u201d the plea agreement read.\n\nThe exact sentence to be imposed on Mr. Abass remains unknown. However, provided Mr. Abass \u201cdemonstrates an acceptance of responsibility for the offense up to and including the time of sentencing,\u201d the prosecution said it recommends \u201ca two-level reduction in the applicable Sentencing Guidelines offense level\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf necessary,\u201d the prosecution adds, it may \u201cmove for an additional one-level reduction if available under that section.\u201d\n\nNot being an American citizen, he will be deported after completing his jail term and paying up the amount to be restituted.\n\nThe maximum penalty for the offense which Mr. Abass hopes will be reduced at his sentencing includes: \u201c20 years\u2019 imprisonment; a 3-year period of supervised release; a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest; and a mandatory special assessment of $100.\u201d\n\nEarlier in June 2020, the 38-year-old known for flaunting his opulent lifestyle on social media was arrested in Dubai by special agents including the Emerati police officers and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operatives.\n\nThe FBI stated in an affidavit obtained by PREMIUM TIMES that its investigations revealed that Mr. Abbas financed this extravagant lifestyle with proceeds of crime.",

But what we don\u2019t agree on is in the area of the presidential election. Kwankwaso wants obi to become his vice presidential candidate and that is not acceptable to us. We have gone beyond an alliance with NNPP, we are unveiling our own vice presidential candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that contrary to criticisms that LP has more formidable structures than the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the major opposition, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nHe further said, \u201cIn the words of Peter Obi, the 100, 000,000 Nigerians that are abjectly in poverty and hungry are his structure, and, let me make it clear the NCFront is a conglomeration of several groups across the country, that is a structure, the National Conscience Party (NCP) and other political parties who are part of the NCFront and believe we can work together have structures, the TUC and NLC have offices in all parts of the country and they are at the grassroots. By the time you put these together, you will find out that LP has more structures than any political party in Nigeria, and it has the people backing it.\u201d\n\nNCFront, a movement of eminent Nigerians led by Prof Pat Utomi, had in the last over one year brainstormed to birth an alternative political platform that will upstage the APC and the PDP in the 2023 general election. It formally adopted LP as the 3rd Force political party in May.\n\nObi, a former presidential aspirant of the PDP joined LP on May 27 after he withdrew from the race for PDP\u2019s presidential ticket and also resigned from the party in a letter dated May 24.\n\nHe won the presidential ticket of LP at the party\u2019s convention in Asaba on May 30.\n\nDr Doyin Okupe, a former Special Assistant to former President Olusegun Obasanjo, as well as Senior Special Assistant to former President Goodluck, was named vice presidential placeholder of the party in early June.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call on the marketers to show more sense of patriotism by taking into cognisance the pains they put other Nigerians through just to make profit.\n\nWe commend the NNPC GMD for standing firm for Nigeria in this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukuma Soludo has explained why he visited the detained leader of the proscribed People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody.\n\nSpeaking with Sam Omatseye on TVC Breakfast show on Monday, the former governor of Central Bank said the move was informed by his resolve to dialogue with anyone and everyone who can help his administration to restore peace and order in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, I did make it a point that I am ready to dialogue with anybody and everybody who will bring security and order to the state. And in that, we met with transporters, traditional rulers and prepared to give amnesty to those in the bush.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that, Nnamdi Kanu is the leader of IPOB, and it has Eastern Security Network. It is important to have full coverage in such that we need to bring everybody on board. I paid him a visit and I am very impressed by what he said in the presence of Senior DSS officials that he is detested by the spilling of innocent blood by some criminals unfortunately operating under the names of IPOB or ESN. But it\u2019s evident to me that quite a number of criminal gangs have emerged because it\u2019s a lucrative criminality \u2013 kidnapping, stealing etc. It has become lucrative business for them. Every criminal gang now claims to be a liberation movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne good thing is that I am happy hearing him denounce criminality, hearing him expressing regret about how things have become, he even told me he is not the one who authorised sit at home. And I didn\u2019t quite understand that initially and severally, his own officials of IPOB have been issuing statements condemning the sit at home and different gangs issuing counter statements. He has his followers but all we want is peace, law and order so that we have the desired development in the homeland.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to question about Kanu\u2019s sincerity, governor Soludo said he cannot read Kanu\u2019s mind or judge him by what he has said in the past. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have the gift to know what\u2019s going on in his mind. Whatever anybody said yesterday, may not matter, anyone could learn from history. The substance for me is hearing him regretting how the homeland has become and consequently asking his supporters to embrace peace and that\u2019s what my take away, not whatever he had said in the past. Now I have a job to do, and my primary role is to provide security for my people.\u201d\n\nMr Soludo who decried the state of criminality in the state, said his administration is determined to return peace and security to the homeland. \u201cWe are determined to return peace to the homeland.\u2019 We are pursuing security, peace and order in all fronts using the carrot and stick approach and the Anambra people are united about this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI must commend the Federal government and the security agencies. Nigeria is facing a lot of security challenges but I must commend them for the assistance. I must say so far so far, we are in sink. By the time I came, there was total silence, nobody was read to give information but that has changed now. There are seven numbers around me and people are cooperating.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former CBN governor said his first one hundred days in office is both challenging and interesting. He however said he is not actually a fan of the 100 days in office school of thought, adding that there\u2019s nothing unusual about the days because he was fully aware of the enormous tasked ahead when he applied for the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I am not a believer in the 100days of a thing but since you guys in the media kept asking, I think I have to create time to address some of what we have been able achieved. The 100days as I said in my address is pumping, it is challenging as expected. But I must said I applied for the job and the good people of Anambra employed me and when I applied I knew the challenges ahead. So no big surprises I must say.\n\nSpeaking on what informed his low key inauguration, the governor said governance is not about the glamour and noise people think it is about, but service to the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d The inaugural reminded us what governance is about. It\u2019s not about glamour, it\u2019s about service.\n\nWe just need to constantly remind ourselves of what governance is all about. On my first day in office, I spent about 8hrs plus. The first three and half hours was an extensive meeting with the security chiefs trying to review the humongous security challenges we have. I didn\u2019t come for the job to answer \u201cyour excellency\u201d I am hired to provide security, create enabling environment for business to thrive, create economic wealth. That\u2019s why they hired me. So I get to work every morning to address governance which is service to the people.

The airline has also disclosed that operations to Israel are in the pipeline.\n\nSpokesperson of Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, who made the disclosure on Tuesday, July 5, 2022, stated that these new destinations were further testimony to the airline\u2019s determination to connect Nigerians seamlessly to other parts of the world and deepen socio-economic ties between Nigeria and both countries.\n\nThe airline will be launching its initial one weekly flight to China on July 13, 2022, and two weekly flights to India later this month, as it hopes to increase frequencies when operations garner momentum.\n\nOlisa, while stressing how Air Peace\u2019s entry into both countries would strengthen their bilateral ties, noted that China and India are not new terrains for the airline.\n\n\u201cGuangzhou and Mumbai are not new terrains for Air Peace as we have operated a number of special/evacuation flights into both cities in the past. So, we are very familiar with the airspace and plans to launch Tel Aviv, Israel, are in top gear. This is also not a new space for us as you know, we have operated flights to and from the country.\n\n\u201cAir Peace is unflinchingly committed to reducing the air travel burden of Africans, and we will continue to grow our route network as well as modernise our fleet strategically. Air Peace has accomplished so much in just seven years of operation, as we now have a network of twenty domestic routes, seven regional routes and two international destinations, including Dubai and Johannesburg, which we launched in 2019 and 2020 respectively\u201d, Olisa asserted.\n\nReiterating Air Peace\u2019s resolve to continue providing peaceful and strategic network connections, in line with its no-city-left-behind mantra, which the airline is aggressively implementing, Olisa hinted that the airline also has in the works two other African destinations \u2013 Malabo in Equatorial Guinea and Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIt can be recalled that in March 2022, Air Peace launched its Niamey route, and a few months before then, flagged off Douala operations from Lagos and PH.\n\nThe airline parades an optimal, mixed, modern fleet of over 30 aircraft, including five brand new Embraer 195-E2s, and has the largest fleet in West and Central Africa.",

          "text": "A rooftop shooter killed at least six people and wounded 24 more at a July Fourth parade in an affluent Chicago suburb on Monday, authorities said.\n\nAlso, a man arrested on suspicion of killing three people and wounding several others during a shooting at a shopping mall in Copenhagen on Sunday had been remanded in a psychiatric facility for 24 days, Danish police said yesterday.\n\nFor the Illinois killings, a rifle had been found and police are searching for a gunman who opened fire at Highland Park police, Commander Chris O\u2019Neill told reporters.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the city of Highland Park confirmed that there\u2019s \u201can active shooter incident\u201d and urged all, \u201cindividuals are advised to shelter in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies are searching for the suspect; evidence of a firearm has been recovered,\u201d the city said. \u201cNumerous law enforcement officers are responding and have secured a perimeter around downtown Highland Park.\u201d\n\nThe shooting happened \u201cin the area of the Independence Day parade route,\u201d the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\nIllinois State Police also responded to the scene, \u201cassisting Highland Park PD with an active shoot situation,\u201d according to a statement the agency tweeted.\n\nPolice were spotted scouring rooftops around Central Avenue near Green Bay Road and Second Street in the aftermath of gunfire.\n\n\u201cIt does appear that he was shooting from a roof,\u201d Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli told reporters.\n\nFourth of July events in other Chicago suburbs, Evanston and Skokie, were also called off in the wake of the Highland Park shooting.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately as you may know, we have an active shooter situation in Highland Park at their parade,\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker told reporters at the Independence Day event in nearby Evanston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still getting reports.\u201d\n\nUnited States Rep, Brad Schneider was at the Highland Park event when shots rang out.\n\n\u201cMy campaign team and I were gathering at the start of the parade when shooting started,\u201d the lawmaker said in a statement. \u201cMy team and I are safe and secure.\u201d\n\nWitness Larry Bloom said at first people thought the popping sound was part of the parade.\n\n\u201cYou heard like a \u2018pop, pop, pop,\u2019 and I think everybody kinda thought maybe it was a display on one of the floats and then it just opened up,\u201d he told NBC Chicago.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and people were screaming,\u201d Bloom added. \u201cThey were panicking and and they were just scattering and I, you know, we didn\u2019t know. You know, it was right on top of us.\u201d\n\nSuspect in Fatal Copenhagen Mall Shooting Remanded in Psychiatric Facility for 24 Days\n\nMeanwhile, a man arrested on suspicion of killing three people and wounding several others during a shooting at a shopping mall in Copenhagen is being remanded in a psychiatric facility for 24 days, Danish police said yesterday.\n\nThe 22-year-old Danish man was known to psychiatric professionals, CNN quoted to have police said earlier.\n\nThe suspect was charged with manslaughter, Copenhagen Police tweeted. The court who heard the case yesterday, put a ban on naming both the suspect and 10 victims named in the charge, the force added in a series of tweets.\n\nThe shooting unfolded on Sunday at multiple locations inside Field\u2019s, a shopping center in the Danish capital. Social media footage showed people running through the mall and heavily armed law enforcement officers on the scene.\n\nAt a press conference, Copenhagen\u2019s Head of Police Soren Thomassen said two 17-year-old Danish citizens, one male and one female, and a 47-year-old Russian national had been killed in the gunfire.\n\nTwo other Danes and two Swedish nationals had received gunshot wounds and were in hospital in critical but stable condition, while several others sustained minor injuries while leaving the mall, Thomassen said.\n\nThe man arrested in connection with the shooting is currently the only suspect. Thomassen said there was no indication the suspect was acting with others but an investigation was ongoing.\n\nEarlier, the police had said they detained the suspect 13 minutes after receiving the first emergency call, and that he was \u201ccarrying a rifle and ammunition\u201d at the time of his arrest.\n\nAt the news conference, Thomassen said there was no indication the attack was an \u201cact of terror\u201d nor motivated by gender, and police believe the victims were chosen at random. The suspect was \u201cknown to people in the psychiatric field,\u201d he said.\n\nGun violence is relatively rare in Denmark. Copenhagen\u2019s last major shooting incident was in 2015, when a gunman attacked a free speech forum featuring controversial cartoonist Lars Vilks, killing one man and wounding three others.\n\nAs investigators piece together the circumstances that lead to Sunday\u2019s deadly shooting, questions are being asked as to how the suspected gunman could have obtained the weapon and ammunition used in the attack, as Denmark is considered to have some of the most restrictive gun laws in Europe.\n\nWhereas in the United States gun ownership is conditionally guaranteed by the US Constitution, in Denmark, the right to private gun ownership is not guaranteed by law, according to GunPolicy.org, an organisation that tracks international firearm policy.\n\nThrough restrictive licensing, Danish authorities attempt to reduce firearm violence by substantially reducing the number of firearms in circulation. An applicant for a firearm license in Denmark must pass a background check which considers criminal and mental health, GunPolicy.org said.\n\nOnly licensed gun owners may lawfully acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition. Applicants for a gun owner\u2019s license in Denmark are required to establish a genuine reason to possess a firearm, for example hunting, target shooting, collection, according to GunPolicy.org.",

          "text": "Multinational oil and gas company, TotalEnergies, has said its effort to increase oil production in Nigeria would materialise this year, disclosing that it was on the verge of connecting the 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) Ikike oilfield to the 200,000bpd-capacity Egina deepwater storage facility.\n\nDeputy Managing Director, Deepwater District, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, Mr. Victor Bandele, disclosed this Monday in Abuja, at the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Local Content Seminar, with the theme, \u201cFunding the Nigerian Energy Mix for Sustainable Economic Growth.\u201d\n\nThis was just as the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) urged oil and gas companies operating in the country to ensure compliance with the Nigerian Content Insurance guidelines for the oil sector.\n\nIn his presentation at the seminar, Bandele said TotalEnergies would continue to make significant investments in Nigeria, assuring that the Ikike oilfield would soon start producing.\n\nHe said the import of that commitment was that the company was fully integrated in Nigeria, adding that TotalEnergies produces more than 20 per cent of total oil output in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are putting in another field into Egina this year. That field, the Ikike field, has the capacity to produce about 50,000 barrels per day. For that to have happened in 2022, it means the journey started some years back when it was rough.\n\n\u201cAnd that is the kind of delivery action that I talked about, that you will decide that because we believe in something, you must step into it regardless of the challenges.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we are present in the upstream, the midstream and the downstream. You cannot get away from us and we cannot get away from you.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that we are fully integrated in Nigeria. As I speak, we produce more than 20 per cent of total oil in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are the second highest producer and supplier of gas to the Nigerian population and the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited.\u201d\n\nBandele said as the world continues the transition to cleaner sources of energy, it was imperative for the government to show the direction the country should go and intensify collaboration with industry stakeholders.\n\nWhile noting that diversification to cleaner energies offers a lot of benefits, he said with the federal government of having set a target of providing electricity access to 80 per cent of the population by 2030, such action should spur industry stakeholders to work with the direction of the government.\n\nHe maintained that renewables and natural gas were positioned to lead the Africa\u2019s energy consumption growth as the continent departs from the traditional use of biomass, which currently accounts for about half of the entire energy consumption.\n\nHowever, the duo of the Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Mr. Simbi Wabote and the Chief Executive Officer of NAICOM, Mr. Sunday Thomas, formally presented the Nigerian Content Insurance Guidelines for the oil sector.\n\nWabote explained that insurance of assets and liabilities in the oil and gas industry according to Sections 49 and 50 of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act (2010) stated the requirements for players in the Nigerian oil and gas activities on the need to engage local insurance companies for insuring their assets, liabilities and so on.\n\nHe said it was in a bid to carry out its key mandate of enforcing compliance with the provisions of the NOGICD Act that the board, in collaboration with NAICOM, developed and issued the Insurance Guideline for the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe added that the guideline would contribute significantly towards promoting the development of insurance services in-country and would also drive the retention of financial spending in Nigeria, thereby contributing towards reversing capital flight.\n\nFurthermore, he noted that the guideline would also help to create a database of all insurance programmes procured by operators, project promoters, alliance partners, and Nigerian indigenous companies, to enable the board to monitor utilisation of in-country insurance capacity.\n\nWabote said, \u201cAt NCDMB, we believe that any in-county value retention realised from the insurance sector will further enhance the delivery of our 70 per cent Nigerian Content target by the year 2027.\n\n\u201cThe Implementation Framework of the Guideline highlights the specific directorates of the Board and their responsibility regarding the implementation of the insurance guideline.\n\n\u201cThe Directorates saddled with the responsibility of interpreting and enforcing the guideline will be reaching out to you shortly to provide support and clarity to bring all parties into compliance.\u201d\n\nHe clarified that the goal of the insurance guideline was not to create additional impediments for oil companies but to create job opportunities and in-country value retention to address threats to the country\u2019s socio-economic stability.\n\nWabote, who made a presentation on, \u201cStrengthening Nigerian Content Implementation with the Seven Ministerial Regulations,\u201d pointed out that one of the key lessons of the events in the last one year was the need to develop and sustain local capacities and capabilities to tackle issues of energy security, food shortages, insufficient vaccines, and other socio-economic disruptions.\n\nHe said as the global outlook tends towards prioritisation of survival at sovereign level, it was imperative for every nation to put in place strategies for local content development for its economic sustenance.\n\n\u201cWe utilise this seminar to deepen our local content practice by providing clarity, expositions, tips, and guidance to industry practitioners on provisions of the law, regulations, guidelines, tools and initiatives such as the NC Plan, NCEC, Expatriate Quota, Research and Development, NC Intervention Funds, and others,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged operators in the exploration and production segment of the oil and gas industry to familiarise themselves with the seven Ministerial Regulations and ensure compliance with them as stipulated.\n\nHe listed the seven regulations, gazetted and which became effective on February 2021 as Regulation for Training in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry 2021:l; Regulation for Further Growth of Indigenous Capacity 2021; and Registration of Oil and Gas Professionals with Nigerian Professional Bodies 2021.\n\nOthers are Regulation for the Establishment of Operations in Nigeria 2021; Regulation for Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Technology Transfer 2021; Regulation for Nigerian Oil and Gas Research and Development 2021; and Regulation for Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Enforcement and Compliance 2021.\n\nHe said the seven Ministerial Regulations were meant to strengthen the implementation of Nigerian Content and would be further discussed in the upcoming panel sessions outline for this seminar.",

          "title": "Using Capacity as Parameter for Presidency, Peter Obi Not Comparable to Kwankwaso, Says Galadima",
          "text": "A prominent member of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Buba Galadima, on Monday, said if the major prerequisite for Nigeria\u2019s presidency was capacity, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, was not comparable to the NNPP candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, by all standards.\n\nGaladima, who acknowledged the desire of the South-east to produce a Nigerian president, however, contended that Obi should exercise some more patience, because he still had a lot to learn from Kwankwaso in leadership.\n\nAs discussions around the 2023 general election continued, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Monday, berated the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Labour Party for introducing the placeholder idea into the country\u2019s electoral process. PDP urged Nigerians to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and be ready to vote out the ruling party.\n\nGaladima, a former ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, was a guest on The Morning Show, where he spoke on the electoral alliance between Obi and Kwankwaso.\n\nHe said, though Obi did well, as governor of Anambra State, primordial sentiments of where he comes from should be put aside for the unity of the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cChief Peter Obi was the governor of Anambra State, and he did his best to place Anambra on the map. But if you look at it, definitely, of all the issues that we raised, we had 20 parameters to judge the two gentlemen.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we started, the issue from Peter Obi\u2019s side was that there is a sentiment in the South-east that the president must come from that extraction, and we say, no, we belong to a party called New Nigeria. Those are primordial sentiments that have never assisted Nigeria to become one.\n\n\u201cWe are not yet one nation. And our objective is to eliminate all those primordial sentiments of tribe, where one comes from and religion. It is only us that have the capacity, if given the opportunity, to make that happen.\n\n\u201cWe want to build a new Nigeria. Do we still fall back on primordial sentiments of where our work comes from and Nigeria remains what it is? We need someone with the capacity to run this country and I can\u2019t see, using this parameter, that would place the candidate of the Labour Party above Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. But he has a lot to gain, because he is only 60 years old. Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso is 65.\u201d\n\nGaladima also addressed the notion being peddled on the social media about the presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, 77, and the APC candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, 70, being too old to rule. He said, \u201cSo, if you now make Peter Obi as the president at 60, by the time he finishes his eight years, Senator Kwankwaso would have been 74 or 75 years.\n\n\u201cSo, the young man on the social media, again, will say he\u2019s too old to run for president. But if you allow Senator Kwankwaso to become the president and Chief Peter Obi becomes his vice president, it means at the time, Senator Kwankwaso will be finishing his eight years, Chief Peter Obi would have been 67 or 68 and will be strong enough to run for the president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGaladima described the development strides and economic performance of both Kwankwaso and Obi in Kano and Anambra states, respectively, as unprecedented, saying, if Obi were made to manage the economy as vice president and Kwankwaso managed the development of the country, it would bring Nigeria together as a unified entity.\n\n\u201cIt will be a seamless transition from Kwankwaso to Peter Obi,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cI believe that Nigerians should not use sentiments and that patience is of essence in this matter. For example, Tinubu was patient enough to wait for his time and at this age he picked up the ticket of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cI think people from the south should manage this, because it is easier and simpler for somebody from the South-east extraction to become president easily and supported by a sitting national government, which we intend to do.\u201d\n\nPDP Berates APC, Labour Party over Placeholder Creation\n\nWhile addressing some students of Junior Secondary School, Alugun-Lungu Gwarimpa, Abuja, who visited the PDP national headquarters, the party\u2019s national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the concept of placeholder was alien to the 1999 Constitution, as amended, and the Electoral Act.\n\nAPC and Labour Party had submitted names of their presidential candidates and their running mates before the June 17 deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). But while the APC presidential candidate, Tinubu, submitted Kabiru Masari as his running mate, Obi submitted the name of Doyin Okupe as vice presidential candidate. They were both billed to replace the two running mates latest July 15, when the window for substitution would close.\n\nThe PDP spokesperson, said, \u201cToday, APC has introduced a new political lexicon into the political dictionary of Nigerian. They called it placeholder. There is nothing like placeholder in our law books. It is an imposition by the APC and Labour Party. It is nothing but an imposition on the political dictionary. It is an indication that they are not ready for the presidential election. It shows the level of their not being serious.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the confusion that the APC is introducing into the political system. Just last month, the APC presidential candidate said he graduated from a university in United States, but did not fill or indicate where he obtained his primary and secondary school education.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that you cannot graduate for studies without evidence of where you obtained your early education. Something is wrong and that is why Nigeria is asking that they provide such information.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba called on Nigerians to rally round the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and his vice presidential candidate, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, stating that they represent a symbol of unity that would unite Nigeria and tackle the ravaging insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to Ologunagba, \u201cAPC represents a command dictatorship that has so far offered no relief to the sufferings of the people. Rather, what the APC has done is to triple the sufferings of our people.\n\n\u201cPDP as a party believes in negotiation and manages its differences, where there is one, but the APC has a command imposition structure, which is antithetical to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe national publicity secretary told the students that Nigerians must use the opportunity of the general election to vote out APC, saying, \u201cNigerians cannot afford another four years of misrule by the APC. APC must be kicked out because we have had enough.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba described APC as a party of strange bedfellows that had nothing tangible to offer.\n\nPDP Urges Nigerians to Get PVCs, Vote Out APC\n\nIn another development, PDP said it had concluded plans to hold a roadshow on the streets of Abuja to sensitise the citizens, especially the youth, to register and be ready to vote out APC in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nAddressing a press conference to herald the roadshow, acting National Chairman of the party, Aliyu Damagun, and the Youth Leader, Mohammad Suleiman Kadede, charged the youth to arm themselves with their voter cards to vote out APC next year.\n\nDamagun said, \u201cAs you can see in this country, most of our youths today are idle. What is the cause? Bad governance? How do we change that? Go get your PVC. Go out there and sensitise people; let them come out en masse. All these ASUU strikes that we see, unemployment, banditry and what have you, are all due to bad governance. How do you change bad governance? It is to use your votes and act now.\n\n\u201cYou have to go out there, get people informed, let them come out and get their PVCs so that we vote out this senseless government that has no direction. If you look at them, they don\u2019t even have the mind to initiate this kind of thing. What they are thinking about is that come 2023, they will come and buy you off and continue to labour you, leave you at home, close down your schools and allow you to enter banditry. It\u2019s up to you now to go out there and get your PVC.\u201d\n\nKedede, on his part, said, \u201cWe can no longer deny or pretend that we are now at the lowest point in our national life. The youth of our country have become weary of the future. It is on this note that we call on all Nigerians to go out and get their PVCs, because this is the only tool to unseat them \u2013 these monsters at the corridors of power.\n\n\u201cThe rate of insecurity is alarming and calls for urgent national attention. Ladies and gentleman, the Nigerian students have been out of school for over five months, with no solution in sight. The APC-led federal government has paid deaf ear to the plight of the Nigerian student, thereby, forcing them to roam about the street and become vulnerable to negative tendencies. It is, therefore, imperative for the Nigerian youth to go out and get their permanent voter cards in order to use their votes to unseat the wicked APC-led federal government.\n\n\u201cThe persistent insecurity that has plagued the nation now for a while with no solution in sight is another manifestation of the complete incompetence and abandonment of government by the All Progressives Congress-led federal government. We call on all well-meaning Nigerians to take up their destinies in their hands and activate the office of the citizen by going all out to get their permanent voter cards.\n\n\u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party is, no doubt, the last hope for the common Nigeria on the street. And so, we encourage you all to get your PVC ready for a brighter future. Your PVC is your power. Your PVC is your strength. Your PVC is your equipment to shape the future of your country.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, National Women Leader of PDP, Professor Stella Atoe, said, \u201cEvery eligible Nigerian electorate has the constitutional right to determine who governs the country in which they are citizens. They have the power to change a bad and non-performing government through the use of their votes at the polling units during elections, and install a good one. The power through which this can be done is the acquisition of the Permanent Voter Card (PVC).\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Funmi Ogundare",
