He had also served as chair of the Board of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; as chair of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership Board; and as co-chair of the Board of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health,\u2019\u2019 the agency noted.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has said career politicians were recycling themselves and running Nigeria aground.\n\nAccording to a statement on Tuesday, Hayatu-deen, who spoke at an interactive session with the media, however, said his venture into the country\u2019s politics was to change its character.\n\nHe expressed the optimism that he can clinch the PDP presidential ticket while citing examples of people who rose to leadership positions without holding any political position in the past.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn 1920, Warren Hardy was a publisher; people said the guy was not a politician. He came and claimed the American presidency. There was another oil magnate who was not given a chance but also became the President. The others were the two Bushs, the senior and junior, who were not politicians. In fact, they were better than Trump who had never run for any office before winning the presidency of the United States too.\n\n\u201cThe most recent example is Emmanuel Macron of France. He came from nowhere as an investment banker. There is also the Ukrainian President, Selensky, who was a comedian.\n\n\u201cCareer politicians are recycling themselves and running the country into the ground.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to change the character and complexion of our politics. Is it difficult? It is but it is doable and we are encouraged by the strength of our conviction that we can do it and pick the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nWhile lamenting the level of corruption in the country, the presidential aspirant said the government and elite have failed millions of youths.\n\nHe added, \u201cI have never seen the kind of corruption we are witnessing in my entire life. The Accountant-General of the Federation was alleged to have embezzled N83bn. I say alleged. That is the entire federal allocation of Oyo State for two years. If you multiply this by 10 thousand across other government appointees, you will see why the economy is actually melting.\n\n\u201cNone of those guys carrying AK-47 or Improvised Explosive Devices has anything else to do. Essentially, part of the problem is economic in nature. There are millions of youths who wake up with nothing to do. They have no jobs. These youths have nothing to lose. We, the elites and the government have completely failed them.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Perpetual Onyia is one of the pioneer female crane operators in Nigerian ports industry. A staff of APM Terminals Apapa, started as a reach stacker operator, moved on to empty container handler, rubber tyred gantry crane (RTG), and presently a mobile harbour crane operator.\n\nIn this interview, she spoke with Godwin Oritse on her experience in a male dominated industry.\n\nWhat does diversity and inclusion in the workplace mean to you?\n\nInclusion and diversity mean involving the two genders in the workplace; giving both equal rights and opportunities. It also means not being biased towards a particular gender and not having this assumption that one gender is better or more productive than the other.\n\nAs a female employee at APM Terminals, I am happy to note that my opinions are respected. I have had instances where I made suggestions towards certain areas of the frontline and they were implemented. If you have a good and informed idea, which would have a positive impact, APM Terminals definitely looks into it.\n\nCan you share some of your ideas that were implemented?\n\nWhen I was operating the reach stacker and I noticed that the area where we were working had poor lighting; there was no proper visibility and I had a talk with my shift manager. I told him that this could result in an accident, he said he was going to look into it. In less than a month, I saw them coming towards the area to install a light mast. Basically, the lighting was improved.\n\nAnother idea that was implemented had to do with the cafeteria; food. Yes I am a foodie. I love food. I suggested something cafeteria-related on food being served and timing, and it was implemented. Finally, we had challenges in our locker room, I brought it up and it was worked on.\n\nHow does it feel working in a traditionally male-dominated industry?\n\nAt first it was daunting but now it is exciting. It was initially daunting for me because the biggest thing I have ever driven prior was an SUV. Then I came here and behold this big equipment. I doubted myself at first. Could I do this? But with time, it became exciting. I got used to it and I felt I could even do more. It is really fun! It is this kind of feeling that oh, what these guys are doing, I am also doing the same. It is fulfilling, career-wise I am happy I took up and I am proud of myself.\n\nDo you feel psychologically safe and included?\n\nNot everybody from the opposite gender has come to accept the female gender in this traditionally male-dominated field. Some have welcomed us, some have been receptive enough but there are still others who believe you are not supposed to be here; you\u2019re supposed to be in the kitchen\u2026\n\nDo you have the opportunities and resources to succeed in your job as your male counterparts?\n\nYes, most definitely. I am 101 percent positive that I have the same opportunities and resources that the other gender has to succeed. From day one of stepping into APM Terminals, it has always been a fair and equal chance. Nobody is saying you\u2019re a female, you can\u2019t do this.\n\nThey even want to see you do it and dare you to do it, which is the thing that would have been done to my male counterparts. If you meet your KPI (key performance indicator) for a particular level, and you are ready for the next level, the same opportunities will be given to take a shot at it. Here at APM Terminals Apapa, that is the narrative.\n\nThe theme of the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day is break the bias. How is this important in the workplace?\n\nIt is important to break the bias to reduce any unintentional discrimination and it would also help create an equal opportunity for women in terms of selection and progression to a high level in management and leadership roles. In the frontline, it is important to break the bias to enable us, women, get to the peak in our careers. It also shows that women are included and welcomed.\n\nWomen are currently assuming more challenging roles at APM Terminals. What are your reflections on this?\n\nIt alludes to the popular saying that what a man can do a woman can do better. It shows that there is nothing you could give a woman or challenge a woman to do; and when she puts her mind to it, it would come through. Taking myself as an example, who would have thought that I would get to where I am today! But it is because APM Terminals gave me the opportunity to do it.\n\nThere are some places you go to and they leave you at the entry-level and say they have included women. That is not the idea at all here. APM Terminals gives you the opportunities to take more challenging roles and if I am given that opportunity, why would I waste it? I would take it and maximize it.\n\nIt is good that women are being allowed to take up more challenging roles. It gives room to broader perspectives, soft touches feminine point of view. Where the male masculinity might overlook, the female would see it. A woman always brings a different approach to the table!\n\nWhat progress have you witnessed in APM Terminals in terms of the continuous strive for a diverse and more inclusive environment?\n\nA whole lot of progress has been made. As of 2018 APM Terminals didn\u2019t have any female operators but in 2019 they gave it a shot. They brought some of us in and I am one of the pioneer female crane operators. In 2019, the game changed, we proved that women can also do this. There is basically no department here where you will not find at least two or three females. There has been a lot of progress in APM Terminals Nigeria.\n\nWhen you talk of remuneration, disciplinary actions, benefits, compensation, and promotion, it has been a fair deal since I started here. For my field specifically, it has been fair. It has been equal opportunities, equal progression, equal rights, equal playing field. The playing field has been level for both genders, with everybody moving at the same pace.",
          "summary": "As a female employee at APM Terminals, I am happy to note that my opinions are respected.\nIf you have a good and informed idea, which would have a positive impact, APM Terminals definitely looks into it.\nNot everybody from the opposite gender has come to accept the female gender in this traditionally male-dominated field.\nWhat progress have you witnessed in APM Terminals in terms of the continuous strive for a diverse and more inclusive environment?\nIt has been equal opportunities, equal progression, equal rights, equal playing field.",

          "text": "Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, on Tuesday, officially inaugurated the 3km Panseke-Adigbe-Opako Road within the Abeokuta metropolis.\n\nThe road which traverses Abekouta South, Obafemi-Owode and Ewekoro LG, was one one the roads started but abandoned by the immediate past administration in the state.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony at the popular Panseke Junction, Abiodun described the event as symbolic, as the road was one of the inherited road projects from his predecessor\u2019s administration.\n\nHe further described the project as fulfilment of his administration\u2019s promise to the people of Ogun state.\n\n\u201cThis road has a history. It was started on December, 2018. That makes it one of the inherited projects from the immediate past administration. At the inception of our Administration, and, in our usual methodical, strategic and inclusive approach, we inaugurated a committee to consider the status and viability of these inherited projects. Then, I made a promise to the good people of Ogun State that we will complete all inherited projects that have direct bearing on the development of our dear State. Here we are! We are fulfilling our promises.\n\n\u201cSince 29th May, 2019, our dear State has witnessed a new vista in infrastructural development. We thank God that we are here gathered today not only to commission this road, but to fulfil the promise made. This is to show that our words are our bond with the people of Ogun State\u201d, the governor noted.\n\nAbiodun explained that the 3km road is particularly of economic importance as it traverses three Local Government Areas and also provides a viable bye pass to the busy Ita-Oshin-Lafenwa end of the Abeokuta-Ifo-Sango-Lagos expressway through Obada Oko.\n\nHe added that, \u201con the micro level, this road is an added infrastructure and adds to the aesthetics of this area. It has a reinforced concrete median, a carriage width of 8m in each direction, and reinforced concrete drain and walkway.\n\n\u201cMore than that, its benefits on the macro level are far greater. It is no doubt an added advantage to the successful implementation of our Transport Master Plan, especially the road transportation aspect of our multi-modal transport agenda.\n\nThis road will all boost our transportation development plan for Abeokuta as one of our fastest growing cities. As we look forward to expanding the scope of coverage of the Bus Mass Transit Scheme, the kinds of this road will make the plan easier\u201d, Abiodun stated.\n\nThe governor noted that the people have been enjoying the benefits of the road before the official commissioning, pointing out such underlined the fact that his government is more committed to the provision of amenities that make life easier to the people than the pomp and pegeantry.\n\nWhile expressing elation that \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda of his administration for the continued development of Ogun has continued to receive both state and nation-wide acknowledgement, Abiodun reiterated that he would not make any promise he never wished to fulfill, said efforts were being intensified towards ensuring reconstruction of other major roads, just as new ones were being constructed for a wholesome development of Ogun State.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we are still looking forward to how to handle some major roads such as Sagamu/Ogijo/Ikorodu road; Abeokuta/Ifo/Sango/Lagos road and other Federal roads across our major cities. In fact, we cannot take full advantage of this particular road without having the Abeokuta/Ifo/Sango/Lagos in good condition.\n\n\u201cLet me also take this opportunity to plead that the Federal Government to consider the plea of our two states of Ogun and Lagos that the Federal Government should consider the release and prompt approval for the reconstruction of those roads. The fact is that the argument that some roads are Federal Road, as valid as it is, offers little comfort because there are no Federal citizens. Our people hardly make distinctions on the ownership of road infrastructure. In fact, they often associate States with the particular roads they ply. And, they situate their pains on particular roads with geo-space. All they want and deserve is good governance.\n\n\u201cOn this, our administration will continue to do more for the individual prosperity of our people and development of our dear State. Let me reassure that our Administration is irrevocably committed to a continuous provision of infrastructure and security in all parts of our dear State. In this regard, the roads leading to our farm settlements, rural areas and township roads, in general, will continue to receive utmost attention to facilitate even socio-economic development of all parts of our dear State. All these will enhance our job creation, poverty alleviation and food security programme\u201d, the governor said.\n\nAbiodun, therefore, charged the people in Ogun State, especially the residents of Panseke-Adigbe-Opako axis, to take ownership of the road and other projects that his administration has continued to provide across the state.\n\n\u201cYou are to protect them as they are truly yours. By doing this, you will not only partner in the successful implementation of our Administration\u2019s \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda, but also in creating a viable economy for our dear state\u201d, he noted.\n\nWhile acknowledging the dedication and cooperation of all those behind the successful completion of the project, the governor sought the people\u2019s continued support for his administration in the drive to provide more infrastructure to the benefits of all by paying their taxes and other levies regularly as and when due.",

And during the last exam, we called a stakeholders meeting and invited managers of these organs and we asked some questions.\n\n\u201cWe also collaborated with other security services to spread our net across the country to see what is happening and lo and behold more than 47 proprietors, lecturers and teachers and people conniving with them in perpetrating malpractices are arrested all over the country. Arising from that, the Minister of Education has graciously approved the establishment of A Level data bank. So for example, in a particular university, 90 per cent of those who presented their A level results for admission were found to be fake,\u201d he said.\n\nJAMB\u2019s Head of Media and Protocol, Dr Fabian Benjamin, who commended Oloyede for his massive support for the workshop, called on the board\u2019s public relations staff to leverage on the training to do more in the discharge of their duties amid surge in citizen journalism.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s media has changed the dynamics of influence and put power in the hand of the ordinary people.

It wasn\u2019t envisaged that we should do it in pockets. But you can see that police has been done.\n\n\u201cYou can also see university teachers saying that their own should be done immediately, since we have done police. So, something is being done.

They will bring up something for government to see.\n\n\u201cThere are other people. The doctors are complaining about brain-drain, this and that. Their hazard allowance has to be touched and it was touched by close to 300 per cent.From N5, 000 paid across board for each person, the least person in the health sector is getting N15, 000, while the big ones are getting N45, 000.

          "text": "\u2022Records total operating income of N100.8bn\n\n\u2022Posts N153.6bn profit, mulls dividend payment to shareholders subject to NEC approval\n\n\u2022Warns inflation will make 2022 toughest for investors\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\n\n\nIn spite of the volatility and headwinds in the global economy, the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), yesterday said it delivered impressive financial results, underscoring the resilience of its investment strategy.\n\nWhile it recorded 19 per cent growth in Net Asset to N919.73 billion in 2021, compared to N772.75 billion in 2020, the authority also posted a profit after tax of N153.6 billion, which was slightly down by 1.9 per cent from the N156.5 billion recorded the previous year.\n\nAddressing journalists during the virtual earnings\u2019 report presentation, the Managing Director/Chief Executive, NSIA, Mr. Uche Orji, said it was the ninth consecutive year the NSIA has consistently remained profitable, adding that all the three funds closed the year positive, beating their individual benchmarks.\n\nAccording to him, it posted core income of N100.8 billion in 2021, down eight per cent compared to N109.6 billion in 2020. The core income excluded forex gains of N45.8 billion in 2021 and N51.2 billion in 2020.\n\nProviding further breakdown of its performances in the review period, Orji said total comprehensive income declined marginally in 2021 by 8.2 per cent to close the year at N147.0 billion compared to N160.1 billion in 2020.\n\nNotwithstanding, he described the performance as a, \u201cvery solid result,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019re very pleased with the way we navigated 2021 as an authority.\u201d\n\nThe NSIA boss however noted that global inflation remained a significant disincentive to investments adding that it has continued to distort the global economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cReactions to the raging global inflation may lead to recessions in certain economies as central banks have announced varying measures of rate hikes and halt to balance sheet expansion.\n\n\u201cThe human and economic costs of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have continued to escalate resulting in heightened geopolitical tension, disruption of the global supply chain, inflation, and potential impact on food security.\u201d\n\nOrji added that: \u201cThe growth prospect in China will be undermined by its zero-tolerance stance on the emergence of COVID-19 leading to lockdown in different regions and cities.\u201d\n\nHowever, in view of the positive performances over the years, the NSIA MD said it was considering the idea of paying dividend to the shareholders of the fund including the federal and state governments. But he pointed out that the gesture was subject to the approval of the National Executive Council (NEC).\n\nOrji, said a decision would have to be made as to whether it was necessary for pay dividends now or plough back the proceeds into additional investment for greater returns, given that the NSIA returned $150 million in October 2020, to the government from the Stabilisation Fund in line with the provisions of the NSIA Act 2011.\n\nHe also hinted that the work on the Second Niger Bridge would be completed by December.\n\nAccording to him however, the single biggest risk for global capital market was complicated by the Russia- Ukraine war, as well as supply chain issues in China as it struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that, \u201cthese are all factors that create headwinds into 2022.\u201d\n\nOrji said, \u201cIn Nigeria, these global headwinds are exacerbated by challenges in the local environment. The World Bank, CBN, and Fitch have projected the Nigerian economy will grow by 2.5 per cent, 3.1 per cent, and 2.8 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the outcomes, the growth range will have minimal impact on the per-capita given the population growth rate at 2.5 per cent.\u201d\n\nOrji warned that financial performance of the NSIA in 2022 will be impacted by developments in the global and local environment given its exposure across the three funds namely the Stabilisation Fund, Future Generation Fund and Infrastructure Fund.\n\nBut he assured that the authority will take steps to strengthen the resilience of its strategy through diversification, portfolio selection, and other options to enhance the risk/ return profile and liquidity.\n\nHe said the ESG and assets transfer will be critical to the overall long-term strategy of the NSIA to expand access to third-party capital and support the global effort toward building a climate-resilient economy.\n\nOrji also said that the fund would make significant footprint in agriculture in 2022, stressing that \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to show the abilities in some areas and we\u2019re now going to roll out funding even more aggressively.\u201d\n\nHe insisted inflation remained major constraints to reasonable projections going forward.\n\nHe said, \u201cI did say, that there was just too much money pumped into the market globally and that there will be inflationary concerns. But I remember very smart economists dismissed it and said it was going to be a short-term thing; even some central bank governors, even the Federal Reserve, thought it was going to be short-term.\n\n\u201cWe did say at the time that it will not be and we say that purely as market participants who have seen what it is going to take to untangle the supply chain that has become an issue.\n\n\u201cBear in mind inflation is a big problem for investors. And when it is globalised and synchronised at the same time in the US, Europe, and across Africa, this will continue to challenge and affect returns in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that 2022 would be the toughest year of investing over the last 15 years. Since between 2008 and now this will be the toughest year for investing because navigating inflation and controlling it without triggering a recession is the biggest challenge that central bank governors all over the world have to deal with. And that is always not a good time for investment.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cSo I need you to understand that the outlook in 2022 and beyond will be affected by inflation and numbers may not be anywhere near as close to what they\u2019ve been historically. I think the world is now in a new phase of investment cycles, and we all should be prepared.\u201d\n\nHe further predicted a risk of recession in 2022 as central banks intensify efforts to curtail inflation.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge and the navigation of what many of you are already seeing across most asset prices, particularly technology companies that have been highly valued over the last 2-3-4 years and now feeling the heat as interest rates start to rise in the efforts to contain inflation,\u201d Orji said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is also something that is affecting emerging market debt. Also, this issue of rising interest rates as we curtail inflation I think will continue to affect, emerging market debt, particularly the Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cSo the first half of 2022 maybe up until the third quarter would remain challenging, but I\u2019m very optimistic that into the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, things will look a little bit better.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

However, after weeks of traveling round the country, it is beginning to get crystal clearer how the states may ultimately vote in this all-important pre-election exercise.\n\nAlthough it is public knowledge that there are 15 aspirants in all, angling to fly the opposition party\u2019s flag (after two were disqualified from the initial 17), this analysis is done with four leading presidential hopefuls in focus. They are former vice-president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki; former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi and the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike.\n\nThe chances of the four contestants indicate that while three of the four major contenders will emerge tops having made friends in all the states, the fourth, Obi, well liked across the country and may have the national spread, but that will not translate to enough votes to win him the candidacy of his party, the PDP.\n\nAlso worthy of mention is a former banker and businessman, Mr Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, who although will garner some votes in specific states, especially in the north-east, may not make much impact. In addition, while Governor Aminu Tambuwal will readily win in Sokoto and share votes in a few other states, he will not have the national spread to win the primaries. The same goes for Governor Emmanuel Udom, who is expected to pick a single state and votes in a few others.\n\nWhile extrapolations based on the actual number of delegates might have become nearly impossible following the refusal by the president, Muhammadu Buhari, to sign the latest amendment to the Electoral Act, the current state of play, ironically, has given a more distinct picture of where the states each stand in terms of delegates voting, ultimately. Olawale Olaleye writes\n\nAbia State\n\nA Southeast state under the leadership of Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia would not mind a candidate from the southern zone, in this case Peter Obi. But with the governor recently openly declaring support for Wike, votes here would be shared between the Rivers State governor and Obi, although Wike stands a better chance with Ikpeazu. Abia is for Wike.\n\nAdamawa State\n\nGovernor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, is for Atiku and being his home state, the Adamawa delegates will naturally vote Atiku 100 per cent, both on personal recognition and the governor\u2019s influence. Adamawa Goes to Atiku\n\nAkwa Ibom State\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, is also in the race for the PDP presidential ticket and since governors are in natural control of their delegates, there\u2019s no debating where the delegates in Akwa Ibom would vote. Emmanuel Gets It\n\nAnambra State\n\nAs their governor for eight years, the period of which was believed to have accounted for their best, at least, as the narrative has remained, Anambra State would have been considered a 100 per cent deal for Obi, factoring the home zone advantage, but it is not. While he is going to have a significant edge, he is definitely sharing some of the votes with Atiku, at least, some percentage yanked off his stake. Anambra Goes to Obi\n\nBauchi State\n\nGovernor Bala Mohammed of Bauch State, is also a presidential hopeful, but might have been caught between returning to office as governor and trying his luck at the presidential primary. But in the event he chooses to back any of his co-aspirants and enters into any form of negotiations, Mohammed might direct the Bauchi delegates to vote for Saraki. Until then, Bauchi is standing with its Governor.\n\nBayelsa State\n\nBayelsa is one of the fishing ponds for all the aspirants and they are all likely to battle for votes here, depending on how well they each stand. On the one hand, former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s influence is presumed could help Wike wield some influence, but his bitter relationship with former governor Seriake Dickson, on the other hand, could also work against him, since the incumbent, Diri Diouye, is Dickson\u2019s governor. Yet, Diouye too is friend to both Saraki and Tambuwal, given the National Assembly connection. Thus, Bayelsa is too close to call.\n\nBenue State\n\nAlthough Governor Samuel Ortom of the state would rather a southern president, naturally, he is a friend of Saraki and coming from North Central, there\u2019s zone advantage for the former Kwara governor. Yet, Benue would be shared between Saraki and Wike, while the Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, would get some votes too, because of the Gabriel Suswam factor. Suswam is close to Emmanuel. Benue would be shared between Saraki and Wike\n\nBorno State\n\nBorno is home to Mohammed Hayatu-Deen and zone to Atiku. But Atiku does not currently boast any visible influence in the state, therefore, it is for the taking for Hayatu-Deen. But Saraki and Wike are likely to steal from the votes here, especially, because the governorship candidate in the state, Mohammed Imam, is a factor and ally of Wike. Borno will Ultimately Go Hayatu-Deen\u2019s Way\n\nCross River State\n\nCross River State is between Udom Emmanuel and Wike with some votes going for Saraki and Atiku.\n\nDelta State\n\nDespite the differences between Okowa and Ibori, the state remains for Atiku with some votes going to Saraki.\n\nEbonyi State\n\nEbonyi is definitely rooting for its own, former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim. It\u2019s a no contest zone and another waste of votes as the former senate president is unlikely to make any impact. It\u2019s in the bag for Anyim\n\nEdo State\n\nThe scenarios in Edo come in two folds. First, the case over the leadership of the party in the state is in court. However, If the choice of delegates would be based on the list with Governor Godwin Obaseki, then, the Edo votes are largely for Saraki and partly for Atiku. But If the list by Dan Orbih is the accepted one then the balance changes. Edo is disputed\n\nEkiti State\n\nEkiti State is technically in the hands of former governor Ayodele Fayose, who in turn, is loyal to Wike, the man believed to have bought him the presidential forms. Except for the likelihood that there could be some deviant delegates, who might rail against Fayose, Ekiti might have signed up for Wike 80 per cent, conservatively. Ekiti goes Wike\u2019s way\n\nEnugu State\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State is unrepentantly an advocate of southern president, but is also stuck between Wike and Obi. However, from the current reading of the equation, it is more of Wike than Obi. Enugu is also for Wike.\n\nGombe State\n\nGombe, a North East state, is standing between Wike and Hayatu-Deen and some . One, for zone advantage and the other for friendship and influence leveraging. Looks 50 percent for Atiku and the rest for Wike and Hayattu- Deen\n\nImo State\n\nImo ordinarily offers Wike and Tambuwal near-equal chances of vote-grabbing. This is because of their connections to both Emeka Ihedioha, Tambuwal\u2019s deputy as speaker of the House of Representatives and Sam Anyanwu, the party\u2019s secretary and Wike\u2019s ally. But Obi is also making inroads probably from the votes, riding on the Southeast sentiment. So, Imo is between, Wike, Tambuwal and Obi\n\nJigawa State\n\nJigawa State looks good for Saraki and Atiku, based on the current political extrapolations in the state. The state, which is in the hands of former governor Sule Lamido, ordinarily looks good for Saraki and Atiku\n\nKaduna State\n\nThe North West state is likely to play some tricks on the aspirants. While Saraki may good with votes from southern Kaduna, It\u2019s for Atiku, Wike and Hayatu-Deen\n\nKano State\n\nThe soul of Kano PDP is still in the hands of a former governor of the state, Rabiu Kwankwaso, who still nurses the pain of the 2015 APC presidential primaries against Atiku and co. Kano has the largest chunk of delegate votes on offer. This will be shared between Atiku and Wike\n\nKatsina State\n\nKatsina State is shared former governor of the state, Ibrahim Shema, who is with shared between Saraki and Wike with some Atiku\n\nKebbi State\n\nKebbi is Tambuwal and Atiku\n\nKogi State\n\nAlthough Kogi State shared by Saraki and Atiku\n\nKwara State\n\nKwara is not in contention. Home-zone advantage for Saraki is 100 per cent. It\u2019s a no contest state, its for Saraki\n\nLagos State\n\nLagos State is going to provide the four a good time to battle, however, with Saraki getting the upper hand up to 50 per cent, while Atiku, Wike Obi share the rest.\n\nNasarawa State\n\nNasarawa State is totally committed to Saraki and Atiku\n\nNiger State\n\nNiger State will be shared between Saraki and Atiku\n\nOgun State\n\nOgun State is doing a tripartite deal with Saraki, Atiku and Wike. So Ogun will be shared between Saraki, Atiku and Wike\n\nOndo State\n\nOndo is giving a sizeable number of its votes to Saraki. The state is sympathetic to him because his mum hails from Owo. Saraki will get the bulk of the votes while Atiku and Wike will also get share\n\nOsun State\n\nIn Osun, Saraki has an amazing relationship with the PDP candidate in the state, Ademola Adeleke, who has the delegates in his pockets. Osun is shared between Saraki and Atiku\n\nOyo State\n\nOyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, is though for a southern president, he is also a friend of Wike and sometimes, defers to him. But he also has sentiments for Saraki. Thus, while Oyo may vote Wike considerably, Saraki stands to share some parts of the votes, although paltry. Goes to Wike\n\nPlateau State\n\nPlateau, a North Central state, is playing host to Saraki, Atiku both will share the votes\n\nRivers State\n\nRivers is one hundred per cent for the owner of the state. Wike will take his state, even though it would not change the overall result. Goes to Wike\n\nSokoto State\n\nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, is a presidential hopeful and will definitely take his state. Sokoto is, however, marked a waste of votes as Tambuwal is believed not to stand any chance in the race.\n\nTaraba State\n\nTaraba, a North East state, has always been in the bag for Atiku but that has changed with the current state of play. Atiku mainly with some votes to others\n\nYobe State\n\nYobe State is waiting to share its votes between Atiku and Hayatu-Deen. This is likely to turn out a 50/50 run for Atiku and Hayatu-Deen\n\nZamfara State\n\nZamfara delegates are going to vote for Tambuwal and Atiku.\n\nFederal Capital Territory\n\nDelegates in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) will be shared by Atiku, Saraki, Wike and Obi\n\nIn the final analysis, the PDP primary appears an interesting one that is likely to defy some bookmarking.\n\nIt\u2019s a four horse race given, however given that Hayatu-Deen is new in the race, he may not make much impact. But at the end of it all, it\u2019s a matter of cash because delegates are poor need cash. But when all delegates get cash from all the aspirants, the power of cash is neutralised. Other factors, such as sentiments and conscience may play a role to swing the votes. However, for PDP, it\u2019s too close to call as at today, May 24, 2022.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says \u2018we are never on the losing side\n\n\u2022Inaugurates state governorship campaign council\n\n\u2022Urges INEC to be fair\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\n\n\nWith 26 days to the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State, National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has vowed to ensure that his party emerges victorious in the poll, which he called his first litmus test. Adamu stated this yesterday in Abuja at the inauguration of the Ekiti State Gubernatorial Campaign Council.\n\nThe APC national chairman appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be impartial during the election.\n\nAdamu stated, \u201cWith this inauguration today, we are giving a marching order to the campaign council and our great people of Ekiti State on the platform of our great party, the APC.\n\n\u201cEkiti is the first election that we will be having in this dispensation of APC. God has blessed our lives; God has blessed my life and my political career. Once there\u2019s a contest, there will be a winner and a loser; we are never on the losing side.\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t take that for granted. We are going to work as hard as we can to ensure that we deliver our gubernatorial candidate as the next governor of Ekiti State.\u201d\n\nThe chairman stressed that President Muhammadu Buhari was on his way out of the presidential villa, saying the president has stated clearly that he seeks no extension.\n\nAdamu stated, \u201cThe Nigerian constitution has given him two terms of four years each. He has started his second term and at the end of it, he doesn\u2019t intend to and doesn\u2019t ask for anybody to ask for a third term or any elongation of tenure.\n\n\u201cRecently, he made the same pronouncement sometime earlier this year. So we are on a bond like him to see that he has soft landing and that is to deliver this party to victory and Ekiti State is the first test.\n\n\u201cSo he takes this election very seriously. We will try to do as much as possible, we will be guided by the rules of engagement for elections. We will observe every rule, every guideline and we do hope that those who will be responsible for overseeing the compliance will be fair arbiters, will be fair referees, will be fair umpires.\u201d\n\nNational Organising Secretary of APC, Sulaiman Argungu, said with the inauguration of the committee, the party had commenced the last-mile journey to retaining the government of Ekiti State. Argungu recalled that the party conducted a rancour-free governorship primary election, where Mr. Biodun Oyebanji emerged as the party\u2019s candidate without any of the aspirants sustaining any sort of action against his triumph at any court of law.\n\nArgungu said that was indicative of the cherished democratic ethos of APC and suggestive of its determination to go into the Ekiti State governorship election and any other elections with a united front that would ensure victory at the poll.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn addition to our party\u2019s commitment to respecting constitutionally defined internal processes in our primary elections, we are also determined, and have, indeed, triggered a deliberate policy of mainstreaming the inclusion of our women and youth membership in whatever democratic undertakings we are to embark upon as a party.\u201d\n\nArgungu noted that the inclusion policy was exemplified in the composition of the Ekiti State governorship campaign council. He said apart from the general membership of the council, six more women had been added to specially represent the women\u2019s wing.\n\nHe said the party also added more youths to the campaign council as a reflection of its philosophy of accomplishing the party\u2019s objectives through the contributions and energies of all identifiable stakeholders within the party.\n\nArgungu said, \u201cOur confidence is further reinforced by the legacy of service and delivery of quality projects the outgoing governor of Ekiti State has imprinted on the process and environment of governance in the state.\n\n\u201cWe know that the good people of Ekiti State will pay back the impressive accomplishments of Dr. Kayode Fayemi by voting massively for APC so as to continue enjoying the dividends of democracy being facilitated by the ruling APC in the state.\u201d\n\nChairman of the campaign council and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, however, expressed concern that some members of the council did not appreciate the importance attached to the assignment.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cThis assignment should be acknowledged by all party members because we are only important when we are in power.\u201d\n\nHe said when members \u201ctake the election elsewhere as unimportant or serving the party outside our normal abode as unimportant, then we are dooming the party.\u201d\n\nBagudu assured the APC national chairman of excellent service by the campaign council, and victory in the end.\n\n\u201cYou have said it already that this is the first under your able leadership and because it is a first, it will form a memory of what happened in the last four years, because four years ago, we also had gubernatorial election in Ekiti State and I was privileged and honored to serve as chairman,\u201d the Kebbi State governor said.\n\nBagudu said going into the election would be easier for APC considering Fayemi\u2019s achievements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has disclosed that it will spend N999 million daily to feed approximately 10 million pupils in the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) across the country.\n\nThis was revealed on Tuesday by Aishatu Digil, the team lead of NHGSFP at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on disbursement modalities for the review cost of feeding in the programme in Abuja.\n\nNigerian Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq.\n\nMs Digil said Sadiya Umar Farouq, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, has authorised spending N100 per person daily on feeding in the programme and that 9,990,862 pupils from primary one to three in the programme will now be fed with N100 daily for 20 days in a month, which would amount to N999,086,200 daily.\n\n\u201cPrior to this, we were feeding school children with N70 per child, per meal. This was since 2016, but the president has approved N100 upward review.\n\n\u201cThe breakdown of the N100 is as follows; N70 is for the cost of all food items except egg, N14 for the cost of egg to be implemented through the state structures in partnership with Poultry Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are planning on having \u2018Egg Wednesday\u2019, where each child in the programme will be given one egg every Wednesday.\n\n\u201cN10 stipends for cooks, N5 and N6 for micronutrient fortification, payable to cooks and one naira for quality assurance, payable to supervisors, which is optional,\u201d she told the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nMrs Digil said the programme would eliminate poor implementation practices, adding that the ministry was looking out for reforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Umar Bindir, the National Resource Person of the National Social Investment Programme, said that the programme was not the responsibility of the federal government alone.\n\nMusa Abubakar, the programme manager of NHGSFP in Sokoto State, said pupils and their parents were happy with the initial N70 per meal per child.\n\n\n\nKingsley Anikwe from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development suggested that the formation of school gardens should be encouraged in schools to handle the production of agricultural produce.\n\nThe programme is part of the N500 billion Social Investment Programme initiated by the Buhari\u2019s government to tackle poverty and improve the health and education of children and other vulnerable groups.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been allegations of massive corruption in the programme, allegations that the organisers have vehemently denied.\n\nFor instance, in May 2020, the National Parents Teachers Association, (NAPTAN) described the government\u2019s decision to feed school children during the COVID-19 lockdown as creating avenues to enrich some people through corruption.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has disclosed that it will spend N999 million daily to feed approximately 10 million pupils in the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) across the country.\n\nThis was revealed on Tuesday by Aishatu Digil, the team lead of NHGSFP at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on disbursement modalities for the review cost of feeding in the programme in Abuja.\n\nNigerian Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq.\n\nMs Digil said Sadiya Umar Farouq, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, has authorised spending N100 per person daily on feeding in the programme and that 9,990,862 pupils from primary one to three in the programme will now be fed with N100 daily for 20 days in a month, which would amount to N999,086,200 daily.\n\n\u201cPrior to this, we were feeding school children with N70 per child, per meal. This was since 2016, but the president has approved N100 upward review.\n\n\u201cThe breakdown of the N100 is as follows; N70 is for the cost of all food items except egg, N14 for the cost of egg to be implemented through the state structures in partnership with Poultry Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are planning on having \u2018Egg Wednesday\u2019, where each child in the programme will be given one egg every Wednesday.\n\n\u201cN10 stipends for cooks, N5 and N6 for micronutrient fortification, payable to cooks and one naira for quality assurance, payable to supervisors, which is optional,\u201d she told the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nMrs Digil said the programme would eliminate poor implementation practices, adding that the ministry was looking out for reforms.\n\nMeanwhile, Umar Bindir, the National Resource Person of the National Social Investment Programme, said that the programme was not the responsibility of the federal government alone.\n\nMusa Abubakar, the programme manager of NHGSFP in Sokoto State, said pupils and their parents were happy with the initial N70 per meal per child.\n\n\n\nKingsley Anikwe from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development suggested that the formation of school gardens should be encouraged in schools to handle the production of agricultural produce.\n\nThe programme is part of the N500 billion Social Investment Programme initiated by the Buhari\u2019s government to tackle poverty and improve the health and education of children and other vulnerable groups.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been allegations of massive corruption in the programme, allegations that the organisers have vehemently denied.\n\nFor instance, in May 2020, the National Parents Teachers Association, (NAPTAN) described the government\u2019s decision to feed school children during the COVID-19 lockdown as creating avenues to enrich some people through corruption.",

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami has asked the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele to release $418 million to Linas International Ltd, a company belonging to Prince Ned Nwoko, a former House of Representatives member and other consultants over the Paris Club refund.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed how President Muhammadu Buhari re-approved the payment of the controversial millions of dollars in Paris Club refund to some creditors after being manipulated by Malami.\n\nEmefiele had in a letter dated 29th March 2022 with reference No. GVD/GOV/CON/DGC/210/071 and addressed to Malami said the apex bank was willing to pay millions of dollars to the creditors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe, hereby humbly seek the direction of the HAGF, as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation confirming that there are no impediments against honouring the payment of the promissory notes at their maturity dates, or permitting the rediscounting as may be requested by the beneficiaries in line with the President\u2019s approval so that the CBN may proceed to act accordingly,\u201d the letter personally signed by the apex bank boss had read.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe HAGF would recall a presidential approval for the settlement of Paris Club related judgement debts of states and local governments totalling the sum of USD418.95 million through the issuance of promissory notes to six judgments creditors.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis letter to the AGF came a few months after the apex bank in a letter to some banks said the promissory notes \u201care not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe letter signed by CBN\u2019s Director of Banking Service, Josephine Ajala and addressed to one of the financial institutions, Keystone Bank had read, \u201cWe are in receipt of two letters dated November 17, 2021, from your office, requesting for dematerialization of various FGN promissory notes for Prince Orji Nwafor-Orizu totalling $1,219,440:00 and Barrister Olaitan Bello totalling $215,195:00.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we are unable to accede to your request because currently, Foreign Currency Denominated Promissory Notes are not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system (54) and as such, only Promissory Notes issued in Naira are registered and dematerialized on 54.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponding to Emefiele\u2019s letter, Malami claimed ignorance of various court cases on the payment and asked the CBN to release the money.\n\n\n\nAccording to the chief law officer, Nigeria shouldn\u2019t be seen dishonouring financial instruments issued in her full faith.\n\nEXCLUSIVE_ Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General Malami Writes Emefiele, Asks Central Bank Gov to Release $418m to Ned... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, you are kindly invited to note as follows: That I align with the position expressed by both DMO and CBN in their respective letters under the reference to the pertinent need for the FGN to honour the Promissory Notes in view of the need to sustain Nigeria\u2019s rating and protect her capacity/image in the global financial circle,\u201d Malami said in the letter addressed to the CBN and dated May 17.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria, in good faith cannot be seen to be dishonouring financial instruments issued on her full faith.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat in line with Para D(ii) of the CBN letter, there are no legal impediments against honouring the PN or permitting their rediscounting as May be requested by the beneficiaries. This is important in order to safeguard the general assets of FGN from attachment or any other adverse action that may be triggered by the beneficiaries of the PN.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat in view of the foregoing, any of the beneficiaries who is favourably disposed to be settled through naira equivalent of the Promissory Notes should be obliged.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\n\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General's Office, accused him of making an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned on Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact, took a swipe at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the motion ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that 'let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?'\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement between Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon. Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdwards was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edwards in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edwards through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by the Magu-led EFCC (which) suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edwards and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari saved his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed in 2018.\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General Malami Writes Emefiele, Asks Central Bank Gov To Release $418m To Ned Nwoko, 5 Other Controversial Paris Club Consultants",
          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami has asked the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele to release $418 million to Linas International Ltd, a company belonging to Prince Ned Nwoko, a former House of Representatives member and other consultants over the Paris Club refund.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed how President Muhammadu Buhari re-approved the payment of the controversial millions of dollars in Paris Club refund to some creditors after being manipulated by Malami.\n\nEmefiele had in a letter dated 29th March 2022 with reference No. GVD/GOV/CON/DGC/210/071 and addressed to Malami said the apex bank was willing to pay millions of dollars to the creditors.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe, hereby humbly seek the direction of the HAGF, as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation confirming that there are no impediments against honouring the payment of the promissory notes at their maturity dates, or permitting the rediscounting as may be requested by the beneficiaries in line with the President\u2019s approval so that the CBN may proceed to act accordingly,\u201d the letter personally signed by the apex bank boss had read.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe HAGF would recall a presidential approval for the settlement of Paris Club related judgement debts of states and local governments totalling the sum of USD418.95 million through the issuance of promissory notes to six judgments creditors.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis letter to the AGF came a few months after the apex bank in a letter to some banks said the promissory notes \u201care not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe letter signed by CBN\u2019s Director of Banking Service, Josephine Ajala and addressed to one of the financial institutions, Keystone Bank had read, \u201cWe are in receipt of two letters dated November 17, 2021, from your office, requesting for dematerialization of various FGN promissory notes for Prince Orji Nwafor-Orizu totalling $1,219,440:00 and Barrister Olaitan Bello totalling $215,195:00.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we are unable to accede to your request because currently, Foreign Currency Denominated Promissory Notes are not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system (54) and as such, only Promissory Notes issued in Naira are registered and dematerialized on 54.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponding to Emefiele\u2019s letter, Malami claimed ignorance of various court cases on the payment and asked the CBN to release the money.\n\n\n\nAccording to the chief law officer, Nigeria shouldn\u2019t be seen dishonouring financial instruments issued in her full faith.\n\nEXCLUSIVE_ Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General Malami Writes Emefiele, Asks Central Bank Gov to Release $418m to Ned... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, you are kindly invited to note as follows: That I align with the position expressed by both DMO and CBN in their respective letters under the reference to the pertinent need for the FGN to honour the Promissory Notes in view of the need to sustain Nigeria\u2019s rating and protect her capacity/image in the global financial circle,\u201d Malami said in the letter addressed to the CBN and dated May 17.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria, in good faith cannot be seen to be dishonouring financial instruments issued on her full faith.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat in line with Para D(ii) of the CBN letter, there are no legal impediments against honouring the PN or permitting their rediscounting as May be requested by the beneficiaries. This is important in order to safeguard the general assets of FGN from attachment or any other adverse action that may be triggered by the beneficiaries of the PN.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat in view of the foregoing, any of the beneficiaries who is favourably disposed to be settled through naira equivalent of the Promissory Notes should be obliged.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\n\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General's Office, accused him of making an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned on Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact, took a swipe at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the motion ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that 'let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?'\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement between Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon. Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdwards was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edwards in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edwards through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by the Magu-led EFCC (which) suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edwards and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari saved his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed in 2018.\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can proptech solve Nigeria\u2019s urbanisation crisis?",
          "text": "\u201cNearly 75% of Nigerians living in major cities are tenants, and that says a lot about the need for houses,\u201d begins Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, who is moderating a Live session on property technology\u2014proptech\u2014in Nigeria. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing concern, especially as Nigeria is growing at the rate of 2.5% per annum. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is: where will these people live, and can they afford it?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the United Nations projected that Nigeria\u2019s population will double by 2050; that\u2019s over 400 million people living in Africa\u2019s 14th-largest country by land mass.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Nigeria doesn\u2019t have the land mass to accommodate these people; it is the second-largest West African country with 923,768 km2 (356,669 sq mi) surface area. The problem is that 51.96% of Nigeria\u2019s population\u2014the seventh-largest population globally\u2014is situated in densely-populated urban areas while the rest are scattered across rural communities. At the current growth rate of about 2.8%\u20133% a year, Nigeria\u2019s urban population is expected to double in the next 2 decades.\n\nUrbanisation, especially one as rapid as Nigeria\u2019s, comes with challenges, most notably the insufficiency of basic infrastructures. Some studies suggest that rapid urbanisation has caused most cities in Nigeria to undergo urban decay because of a lack of or breakdown in basic services, potable water supply, electricity, efficient city transport services, affordable housing, and waste disposal systems.\n\nAll these challenges have made house-hunting in urban areas a living hell, with searchers reporting problems like extortive rent prices, high agency inspection fees, duplicity of sales, and misrepresentation. In fact, between December 2020 and April 2021, Nairametrics estimates that rent across urban areas like Lagos and its environs increased by 30%.\n\nIn solving this problem, many have turned to tech. If tech can push financial inclusion in Nigeria from 21.6% in 2010 to 64.1% in 2020, then surely it can do the same for housing.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s proptech industry raising $2 million in investments in 2021 alone, TechCabal sought to answer these questions in a Live session. On May 6, 3 startup founders\u2014Naomi Olaghere, co-founder and VP/Operations, RentSmallSmall; Kanyinsade Ademuson, founder, CEO and Principal Architect of Seventh Space; and Dapo Eludire, COO of PropertyPro.ng\u2014sat with TechCabal Senior Reporter Daniel Adeyemi to discuss the prospects of proptech in Nigeria.\n\nIn small small instalments\n\nNaomi Olaghere kicks off the session by explaining what her startup, RentSmallSmall\u2014a Lagos-based on-demand service offering instalment rent payment options\u2014is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset thing,\u201d Olaghere says. \u201cPeople often think they have to have all their money together before they can buy something or even rent a house, but RentSmallSmall is changing that. We\u2019ve been in existence for 3 years now, and we\u2019re letting people know that they can pay their rent like monthly, quarterly, monthly, or annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how does that benefit the landlord,\u201d Adeyemi asks. In Nigeria, annual rent is a practice vigorously upheld by most landlords with some requiring 2 years\u2019 advance from new tenants.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was a herculean task to get landlords to agree to collect monthly rent,\u201d Olaghere explains. \u201cIt\u2019s still an uphill battle, but we\u2019ve been able to show them the benefits of RentSmallSmall. For example, we can assure landlords that defaulting tenants will be out within a week because of our licensing agreements with the tenants. We\u2019re also very concerned with long-term preservation of assets, and that helps us build trust with landlords.\u201d\n\nDesign for your users\n\nAt Seventh Space, Kanyinsade Ademuson and his team believe in developing houses for the average upwardly-mobile Nigerian.\n\n\u201cLast year, I was in the market for an apartment for 6 months, and I have to tell you, I\u2019ve seen houses,\u201d Daniel Adeyemi exclaims. \u201cSome \u2018affordable\u2019 houses with 2 feet kitchens, and some houses overpriced because of POP ceilings. What kind of solutions are there for affordable and habitable housing?\u201d\n\nAdemuson believes the answer is simple: \u201cStop developing houses that your target market can\u2019t afford.\u201d \u201cIf you look at the property trends today, builders are developing for people who genuinely can\u2019t afford them. However, I think that one of the major solutions we can provide is actually getting designs that are centred around average Nigerians who are genuinely poor.\u201d\n\nThe way to do that, Ademuson says, is by taking advantage of underutilised properties and increasing the speed of production. \u201cThere are a lot of lands that are owned but unused. Part of the solution is to create policies that ensure the usage of underutilised lands. We also have to consider our environment, and build for the environment we are in. We need to look at different technologies or building technology methods, using different materials and materials that we can research and create here, within Nigeria, and which are suitable for our environment.\u201d\n\nFinally, Ademuson says, the next step is to produce quickly and in large quantities. \u201cWe need to figure out a way to produce more, and this means factory-assembled production or linear production that caters to the needs of people while driving the prices of houses down.\u201d\n\nNo space for data or trust\n\nFor Dapo Eludire whose startup, PropertyPro.ng, is one of Nigeria\u2019s leading real-estate search platforms, the solution lies in finding and housing data.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have centralised data,\u201d Eludire laments. \u201cThe data we have is collated by individuals, not by the government so you can\u2019t depend on it. We don\u2019t know the market trends or its movements, and so we are forced to move blindly.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust is the next step, as Eludire believes. \u201cLiquidity in the real estate sector is not enough, so everyone is careful of whom they buy from. A lot of scrutiny goes into deals, and this elongates timelines. But building trust will allow deals to flow accordingly so everyone can manage their time well.\u201d\n\nCollaboration breeds growth\n\nProptech deals across Africa are gradually growing, projected to increase by 6.4% between 2019 and 2024. All 3 founders agree that a large contributor to the growth is collaboration.\n\n\u201cProptech has sub-sectors,\u201d Olaghere explains. \u201cThere\u2019s the financial part, the construction segment, the user segment etc. And a lot of proptech companies have begun to understand the importance of collaborating with stakeholders in the different sectors. This is what has helped with growth and development.\u201d\n\nAdemuson believes that most of the growth has been on the service or software end at the expense of the hardware end which has been left out. \u201cWe\u2019re lagging on the production end of things, and we need to figure out how to build better and faster for our end users.\u201d\n\nBuilding ahead\n\nIn search of better growth, Eludire believes that the next step in proptech development is for the private financing sector to provide more liquidity for users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always an expensive venture whenever you\u2019re buying or renting a property. People use over 40% of their annual earnings for rent alone. We have to create and enable more liquidity in Nigeria, just like what Naomi and RentSmallSmall is doing. Because of solutions like that, more Nigerians are able to afford housing.\u201d\n\nEludire also calls on the government to enforce licensing of trained real estate agents. \u201cEverybody is a real estate agent in Nigeria, and most are untrained. There are no rules, no guidelines or etiquette that they learn; they\u2019re all just there for the commission. We don\u2019t even know how many agents we have because everyone is in it, and that\u2019s why agents misbehave, extort renters, and misrepresent property owners.\u201d\n\nNigeria has no federal law mandating the registration of real estate agents, but it does it have state laws or policies regulating their activities like the Lagos State Property Protection Law of 2016. However, none of these laws mandates registration for agents, so there is no recourse for tracking the activities of wayward agents.\n\nSolving this problem, as Eludire explains, will help ease renters\u2019 experiences in the sector.\n\nIn closing, Olaghere reiterates the importance of collaboration between the government, the proptech sector, and more importantly, the end users.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share to your network on WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has created a new tax on phone calls in the bid to fund free healthcare for Nigerian citizens who cannot afford healthcare\u2014the vulnerable group. The law defines the \u201cvulnerable group\u201d in society as \u201cChildren under five, pregnant women, aged, physically and mentally challenged persons, and indigent people as may be defined from time to time\u201d.\n\nThis new law is stated in the new National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari last week.\n\nThe provisions of Section 26 sub-section 1c of the Act states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes \u201ctelecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\u201d\n\nOther sources of income for the Vulnerable Group Fund include the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, health insurance levies, grants, donations, gifts, and any other voluntary contributions. The law also requires that all persons resident in Nigeria are expected to obtain health insurance.\n\nWith average call rates of 11 Kobo per second, this new act implies that there will be a tax of at least 9% on every second of all phone calls made in Nigeria.\n\nNigerians made 150.83 billion minutes of calls in 2020 according to a report by the Nigerian Communications Commission. This translates to 9.05 trillion seconds of calls, meaning the new tax will generate at least 9.05 trillion Kobo, which converts to \u20a690.49 billion ($18.09 million), annually.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when this new tax will take effect and how much it\u2019ll be but it hints that there\u2019ll be an increase in call-tariffs in Nigeria, as it\u2019s unlikely that the telecom companies will absorb the cost.\n\nLast month, telecom companies under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria proposed a 40% increase in the cost of calls, SMS, and data as a result of the rising cost of operating in the country. This new tax creates a more compelling case for the telcos to hike their prices.\n\nShare this article",

The training designed for 3000 young entrepreneurs between 18-35 years who own or manage a Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) for at least two years, had participants from Kogi, Adamawa, Jigawa, Anambra, Cross River, and Lagos States.\n\nThe training session began with Google, and after a two-week-long intensive training on the virtual platform, Oluwatumise Ife-Abidakun led the concluding training session on Friday, May 6, 2022. Participants were taught how to use digital marketing tools and social media to grow their business online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Google training had three learning agendas. The first focused on how business owners can set up and optimise their Google My Business (GMB) listing. The second schedule was to show the trainees how to plan their digital marketing strategy, and the third learning agenda focused on how the participants can leverage social media channels and email marketing in their business.\n\nSpeaking with Techpoint Africa, Oluwatumise said that she believes the event has been very rewarding to the participants. \u201cThe participants already had a basic knowledge of the things taught; an example was setting Google My Business listing. However, most of the participants were just hearing them for the first time. Therefore, it created an opportunity for the participants to learn something new during the training\u201d she said.\n\nThe second training session was in partnership with Microsoft, and the training ran for a period of one week. The final training led by John Oparaji from Tech4dev and Promise Ederagobor, held on Friday, May 13.\n\nThe training focused on Microsoft tools, especially PowerPoint. Participants were taught the different uses of Microsoft PowerPoint, and how to efficiently make use of the tool to advance their respective businesses.\n\nSpeaking on the training, John said that the feedback received from the participants has been positive, as participants are well invested in the program and many of them appreciate the efforts of the MTN Foundation. \u201cThe participants ask questions, work on what they have learned, give feedback, and ask more questions for clarity,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the presentation by the training instructors, some participants used the same medium to commend the MTN Foundation and the partners, Google and Microsoft, for the training opportunity and provision during the training.\n\nThe ICT and Business Skills training by the MTN Foundation is aimed at improving the entrepreneurial and employability abilities of young Nigerian entrepreneurs. The training will run for a period of four weeks in partnership with other ecosystem partners, including Meta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "title": "How companies can shape the narrative for tech-enabled mobility in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Nigerian mobility companies were high-flying. Moving around major cities like Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt, or travelling between different cities became so easy with the tap of a few buttons on the smartphone.\n\nIn the period in question, companies like GIG Mobility, Max.ng, Gokada, and OPay\u2019s ORide took the mobility space by storm, and soon after Pan-African players like Safeboda came into the mix. Before the infamous Lagos Okada ban, venture capital funding in Nigeria seemingly showed a healthy appetite for the new kids on the block.\n\nSince then, funding for mobility companies ($147m in 2021) have largely gone to companies on the vanguard of innovation and sustainability in Africa\u2019s mobility space.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s mobility companies have witnessed varying fortunes, there are important factors that are currently not being addressed in the sector. Cracks that are currently being papered over with technology.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent developments suggest that this might be about to change.\n\nLed by mobility giant, GIG Mobility, major players in Africa\u2019s mobility space are gearing up to have important conversations at the inaugural Africa Mobility Conference taking place on June 2, 2021 with theme: Pathways to the future of mobility in Africa.\n\n\u201cJust stepping into the mobility space, I realised the players in the space are not trying to shape the narrative,\u201d says Enahoro Okhae, newly appointed CEO of GIG mobility. \u201cWe need to have several important discourses across different spheres for the industry to be stabilised.\u201d\n\nTaking a glance across the globe, you\u2019d realise that Okhae\u2019s assertion holds true. Big tech companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla, have mastered storytelling to shape the narrative around their industry.\n\nWhat to solve in Africa\u2019s mobility sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you read our 2020 article on the deep challenges of mobility and logistics in Nigeria, by now you should realise that the challenges run even deeper. No matter what wind blows in the universe, people will always need to move.\n\nHowever, Okhae points out that several people are still not aware of the impact that insecurity is having on people traveling in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen you see physical evidence of insecurity in our roads, you\u2019re only seeing it after hundreds of issues have been dealt with. If 1 person is flying, maybe another 1000 is travelling by road.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, the tabloids have been filled with news of insecurity in Nigerian roads. For context, look no further than the hijacking of the Abuja-Kaduna train by armed gunmen, which led to the loss of lives and property. With such chilling stories flying around, some Nigerians have preferred flight over road trips, but given the cost of plane tickets, only a minute percentage of Nigerians have that luxury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), transportation contributes up to 3% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. When you consider that Road transportation accounts for 90% of this GDP contribution, Okhae\u2019s argument really shines through. While Water and Rail transport show decent numbers, the NBS describes Air transport\u2019s contribution as negligible.\n\n\u201cWe need to have very necessary conversations about the issue of insecurity and present these findings to the relevant policy makers in government to have the necessary change.\u201d\n\nWith the heavy reliance on road transport for travel and logistics, Okhae also highlights the impact it would have on our environment.\n\n\u201cWe live in a society where people don\u2019t really care about stuff like sustainability. As a company actively playing in the mobility sector, we need to saddle ourselves with the responsibility of having such conversations early enough.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okhae, the vehicles going out everyday negatively affect the environment, and we need to start taking alternatives like electric vehicles very seriously.\n\nA 2018 World Bank study reveals that air pollution cost Lagos, Africa\u2019s largest city, up to $2.1 billion and 11,200 premature deaths. Road transportation, the report says, was the primary source of air pollution.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve seen innovations in the clean tech space with the likes of Jet Motor company for electric vans, then Max mobility, and Siltech for electric scooters and bikes.\n\n\u201cRather than buy diesel for several vehicles, I\u2019d rather buy just one generator and use that to charge several vehicles before going on a trip,\u201d Okhae adds.\n\nHow to innovate for mobility in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nICU monitoring hub\n\nIn other parts of the world, mobility is witnessing defining moments with technology in the mobility sector, but Africa is seemingly being left behind.\n\nJude Odum, COO of GIGM reveals that the rest of the world are making advances with self-driving vehicles and other mouth watering features and Africa needs to get there sooner than later.\n\n\u201cBefore we even start talking of those, we need to overcome the systemic barriers like security and the local economy itself. 4 years ago, we could spend $16,000 to bring in a brand new Toyota Hiace bus into the country. Today, you spend almost three to four times that amount to bring in the same vehicle.\u201d\n\nSadly, Odum reveals that due to the current economic terrain, mobility operators have not been able to increase prices commensurate with the overall market conditions.\n\nAt the mobility conference, Odum hopes the conversation goes beyond just the regular road, rail and air transport.\n\n\u201cCould we have something else that could help mobility in Africa given our current challenges? How is the government developing policies that will create an enabling environment for mobility operators?\u201d\n\nOn some level, Odum\u2019s discourse reminds us of the current rave with the metaverse and how it could upend our lives and move. But in the realm of current reality, the possibilities remain endless and current players need to take action.\n\nThis platform, according to both executives, would be perfect for automotive manufacturers with a huge market in Nigeria.\n\nNames like Toyota, Volkswagen, and Mercedes readily come to mind. Considering the current state of vehicle manufacturing in Nigeria, there\u2019s a lot to be done.\n\nPer Okhae, the conference floor will be open to innovative young minds who are developing solutions for Africa\u2019s mobility sector. He also maintains that the security conversations would be relevant for anyone travelling in Nigeria.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to get into the thick of the conversation, register here on the Mobility Platform website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and narrator of technology, business and policies in Africa .

According to the data company, Ibis World, the rise in renting cars short-term is driven by a combination of factors including an increase in tourism, a rise in environmental awareness and wanting a flexible option when it comes to vehicles.\n\nLike many other industries benefitting from digitalization, the automotive is one that has seen significant growth online, with consumers conducting more research than ever before online before renting or buying a car. With a drastic increase in leasing cars and a move to digitalize the industry, one entrepreneur has combined the popularity of car rentals with the instant-booking ease of the online holiday site, Airbnb.\n\nOffering a range of services from chauffeur-driven, self-drive car rental and luxury transfer services, Founder Ikenna Ordor has created an Airbnb-style service for clients looking for reliable transport options at short notice.\n\nThe key focus is on providing the best possible service from the moment a user visits Starr Luxury\u2019s website, empowering users with a quick online booking process that connects them to the largest supercar fleet in the UK, including names such as Ferrari, Aston Martin and Bentley.\n\nSince launching, Starr Luxury Cars has proved the demand for luxury car hire in the UK is very much alive and kicking, having doubled their online growth by 100% year on year. The easy-to-use online journey allows users to pick a car by brand or type, delivering it to an address the next day.\n\nGrowing up in Nigeria, Ordor was inspired by his tenacious, hard-working mother and describes how he fell into entrepreneurship whilst studying at Birmingham University. Speaking to Forbes Magazine, Ordor shared \u201cI ended up in entrepreneurship almost mistakenly when I decided to host an event one night with just a few friends. I liked the idea that we\u2019d be able to create so much profit in one night from doing something we loved.\u201d Shortly after graduating, Ordor had set up his own entertainment company and quickly started to spot demand for car hire amongst clients as more people asked him to organize luxury transport options. Boasting a seamless end-to-end service for premium clients, Ordor wanted to create an experience where someone could book a supercar at 9 pm and have it delivered the next morning.\n\nHaving identified a gap in the market almost by accident, Ordor has demonstrated a clear understanding of what makes a reliable and trustworthy service. As a direct result of this, Ordor has also seen his company grow to new heights online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClients using Starr Luxury Cars include corporate professionals, families on holiday in the UK, film industry professionals and couples on their wedding day. The rapid success Starr Luxury Cars has enjoyed so far is an indication that more people are choosing to adapt to the changing fiscal landscape, ditching the traditional ideas of ownership for one high-end asset for the choice of many instead.\n\nOffering a wide choice of electric luxury car hire options too, the prestigious car hire company also recognise the need to respond to climate change as an industry. Starr Luxury Cars respond by actively encouraging their fleet partners to promote electric vehicles, stocking only the best-performing electric cars available on the market such as Tesla, Jaguar and Audi.\n\nAlthough the business has focused on car hire and chauffeur experiences so far, the sky\u2019s quite literally the limit for Starr Luxury Car which has plans to expand into offering private helicopter flights as well as an app which would propel the business into international territory. Ordor has visions of being able to supply users with their favourite car in other cities around the world and has already hinted at expanding his premium car hire service in Nigeria.\n\nFor now, ensuring every customer who engages with Starr Luxury Cars has the best possible experience is Ordor\u2019s number one focus and one that has kept his ever-expanding business from enjoying success at every point. With Starr Luxury Cars\u2019 presence now in LA, Atlanta and Miami to name a few new spots, it\u2019s impossible not to see continued growth for this enthusiastic entrepreneur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nTraditional rulers led by the Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe and the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun, have said the modest achievements of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has earned him second term.\n\nThis is even as the Governor maintained that his campaign strategy would continue to be issue based and development driven, as he plans to consolidate on the gains recorded so far in order to set the state to the path of socioeconomic rejuvenation.\n\nSpeaking in his palace where other traditional rulers across the Council assembled, Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe, said the indelible footprints of the governor would speak for his re-election as, according to him, the governor has performed creditably well.\n\nOba Fadipe who described the administration of Governor Oyetola as unprecedented, said he has been tested and trusted and is therefore qualified for a second term.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlease continue with your good work. We are satisfied with what God has made you to do within three and a half years. You have convinced us beyond reasonable doubt and done so much beyond expectations.\n\n\u201cYour style of governance is unique. You have been running an all-inclusive and people-oriented governance.\n\n\u201cYou are a calm, cool, collected and calculative man who has been silently achieving great things and squeezing water out of solid rocks.\n\n\u201cWe know what is accruable to the State in terms of resources but despite this obvious reality, your government has not disappointed us or left anyone in doubt of your capacity to achieve great with little.\n\n\u201cYou have proved that it is only an empty barrel that makes noise. Your campaign slogan is speaking for you already. That is why your achievement knows no bounds.\n\n\u201cAs traditional rulers, we are good assessors. We have assessed your achievements and we are satisfied with all you have done.\n\n\u201cWe have seen integrity personified in you. We have seen Omoluabi ethos par excellence in you, and your calmness and integrity have endeared you to many.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to you all to support him wholeheartedly because he deserves to be re-elected\u201d.\n\nCorroborating, the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun, lauded the Governor for being faithful to his electoral promises made to the people of the State, saying he has justified the people\u2019s mandate.\n\nOba Adeseun said the good work of the Governor are clear testimonies to the fact that he merits second term, noting that seeking an alternative to him is suicidal to the future of the State.\n\n\u201cYou have demonstrated good intentions in all you do, and you have been tested, trusted and you are worthy of re-election for second term. Just ride on, we have confidence in you and firm belief that you will win and get re-elected. To us, you have done excellently well, and as traditional rulers, what you have done particularly for traditional rulers in Osun, no one or no Governor has done it in the history of this State.\n\n\u201cYour achievement has surpassed what we have experienced in the past. We don\u2019t know where you have been getting money to run the affairs of the State. You have proved to us that you are a financial wizard and an economy expert. You have done beyond expectations.

I am appealing to the people to remain calm and unperturbed as we are doing everything possible to maintain peace and order.\n\n\u201cWe have charged the security agencies to go after the perpetrators. Osun is known for peace and we will continue to maintain that status no matter what. Violence will not help any one or take anyone anywhere. I have been tested and trusted. We are sure of victory, and in a free and fair contest, I will win by the grace of God\u201d, Oyetola added.",

It is a must that you consolidate the good works you\u2019ve done, and that is why another four years is necessary.\n\n\u201cWe know your desire to govern Osun is not for selfish gains or interest and that is why your reelection is our collective project here in Gbongan\u201d, Oba Oyeniyi said.\n\nThe Alayegun of Ode Omu, Oba James Bolanrinwa Alabi Oladipupo, on his part, described Governor Oyetola as a fulfilment of God\u2019s promise to Osun, adding that his performance in three-and-a-half years showed that he was raised to fix Osun.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cGod made a promise to Osun and fulfilled it with the emergence of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. Those who are observant will know that there have been tremendous and significant changes in Osun since he became governor, and he will do even better if trusted with the mandate again.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you all not to work against the fulfilment of God\u2019s promise. Rather, let us join hands with the man who has been ordained for this great task. I believe that come July 16, he will emerge victorious\u201d, Alayegun said.\n\nThe President of Ode-Omu Descendant Association and a retired civil servant of the state, Akin Olaniyi, who described Oyetola as a \u201cprivate sector administrator and financial wizard\u201d, lauded him specifically for looking into the plight of workers in the state, among other things.\n\nHe expressed optimism on the success of the campaign and election, saying that \u201cyour outstanding performances across the state have gone ahead of you\u201d.\n\nIn Orile-Owu, the Olowu of Orile-Owu, Oba Daud Ajolola Akinfalabi, also pledged the readiness of the Owu community to support Oyetola\u2019s reelection on the strength of his performance.\n\nOba Akinfalabi who commended the governor for running a clearly defined, participatory and an all-inclusive government, registered his community\u2019s confidence in Oyetola\u2019s ability to consolidate on the works he had done in his first term.\n\nWhile addressing a mammoth crowd at the campaign venues, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola said his performance in the last three-and-a-half years is proof of his depth in progressive ideology.\n\nOyetola, who reiterated that he is in government to serve, called on citizens to support his drive and aspiration to collectively fix Osun.\n\n\u201cYou handed me the mandate as your governor four years ago, and through the help of God, I did not disappoint you. I trust that you are not going to deviate this time around.\n\n\u201cOur works have shown that we are not neophyte in politics. In 1983, I had the privilege of sitting and interacting with Baba Awolowo, and that attests to the fact that I understand the concept of progressive governance. We are not in government to struggle for relevance, we came to serve, we came to fix Osun.\n\n\u201cWe have taken note of other concerns, and we will attend to all in due time. But we must also remind you that this is an effort that requires collaboration. That is why we are appealing for your support, before, during and after the election, to enable us fix the state.\n\n\u201cOsun is at a very delicate phase in history, let us entrust its leadership to hands that have been tested, not gamblers or jesters, or those who think Osun is for sale\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nEarlier, the Director-General of the Campaign Council and Senate spokesperson, Senator Ajibola Basiru, appealed to citizens to turn out in large numbers to cast their votes for Oyetola, who he described as a worthy candidate.\n\nBasiru said the financial situation in Osun requires serious engineering, and Oyetola has shown capacity to creatively manage the lean purse of the state without further plunging it into liabilities.\n\n\u201cLet us all come out in our large numbers to vote, but let us also not be tired of propagating the good works of Governor Oyetola. Whoever must be governor must know his right from his left. Politics in Osun has gone beyond promoting mediocrity. No one can paddle the boat of Osun like Oyetola. The financial situation requires so much calculation, and Oyetola is that calculated leader we need\u201d, Basiru said.",

elimination of the culture of political investigations and prosecutions; strong will in reforming the oil and gas sector; sustainable reforms in the maritime sector; treasury single account; recoveries of the proceeds of crime and forensic audit of revenue generating and big spending agencies.\u201d\n\nThe chairman, Governing Council CIFCFEN Board of Trustees added that sustenance of best practices such as open government partnership, as well as the open contracting regime and beneficial ownership disclosure would have the significant potential of increasing the nation\u2019s revenue by N10 trillion in the short term.",

elimination of the culture of political investigations and prosecutions; strong will in reforming the oil and gas sector; sustainable reforms in the maritime sector; treasury single account; recoveries of the proceeds of crime and forensic audit of revenue generating and big spending agencies.\u201d\n\nThe chairman, Governing Council CIFCFEN Board of Trustees added that sustenance of best practices such as open government partnership, as well as the open contracting regime and beneficial ownership disclosure would have the significant potential of increasing the nation\u2019s revenue by N10 trillion in the short term.",

There are policemen and EFCC operatives all over my compound and my gate has been blocked with their cars.\n\n\u201cAnd all I am asking is for them to please allow me to go for my screening which is going on right now with all the presidential aspirants and the primary election is on Sunday and if I am not allowed to go out for the screening I might miss it. I am not an unknown person. I have address and all it takes is for EFCC to send me invitation and I will oblige.\n\n\u201cAs I speak now, I have requested for an arrest warrant arrest, any court order but none seems to be available. Any invitation? There is none known. I have not been invited and I refused to go. My lawyer has addressed then and they are saying they have instruction from above to come and get me.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know if it is an arrest or invitation, and if it is invitation it would only take a letter or a phone call and I will be there but the issue of creating trauma to members of my family is not the best way to go.\n\n\u201cI want to kindly appeal to the EFCC to allow me to give for my screening and do my election. EFCC had said they were taking me to court but I have not been served. I have series of court orders and judgements.\u201d\n\nEFCC\n\nHowever, EFCC Head, Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, in a press statement, later in the day, said: \u201cOperatives of the EFCC, Tuesday, May 24, 2022, arrived at the Maitama, Abuja home of a former Governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha, to effect his arrest.\n\n\u201cThe move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission.\n\n\u201cEFCC had on January 24, 2022, filed a 17-count criminal charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9billion against Okorocha.\n\n\u201cThe case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja but attempts to arraign Senator Okorocha were twice stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes.\n\n\u201cAt the last adjourned date, March 28, 2022, Justice Ekwo before adjourning until May 30, 2022, had warned that it was \u201cthe last adjournment I shall grant in this matter\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances, the Commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "title": "Alleged killing of northerners: Anambra government cautions on reportage\u2026 CNG, CAN warn on conspiracy of silence",
          "text": "The Anambra state government has said contrary to insinuations making the rounds, there is no religious or ethnic killing in the state.\n\nThe government said the clarification became necessary because of what it described as a \u201cmisleading\u201d media report.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday in Awka, the state government, through the Press Secretary to the governor, Christian Aburime, said the clarification became necessary to avoid plunging the nation into further security challenge.\n\nAburime stated that Governor Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s administration has not only demonstrated commitment to tackling insecurity, but continuously reassured both indigenes and non-indigenes in the state of their protection and safety.\n\nWhile acknowledging there is general insecurity across the country, the state government said there is no targeted religious or ethnic killings in the state, adding that Anambra indigenes suffered more casualties as a result of the unfortunate killings.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cThis release has become necessary to set the records straight about a misleading publication\u201d on the cover of a major national daily where the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) reportedly killed a woman and her four kids, as well as six other northerners.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that there is general insecurity across the country, there is no targeted religious or ethnic killings in Anambra State. As a matter of fact, Anambra indigenes have suffered more casualties as a result of the unfortunate killings,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhile saying the \u201creport has the tendency to stir anger and disaffection in other parts of the country,\u201d Aburime said the story was \u201cinimical to the unity and progress of the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government of Anambra State hereby states that the report is not only sensational but misleading and should be immediately retracted to reflect the real situation on the ground.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that Ndi Anambra and people of the North and other parts of the country, who live and do business in the state, not only share common values, but have always lived at peace with one another other in the state.\n\n\u201cGovernor Soludo\u2019s administration has not only demonstrated commitment in tackling insecurity, but has continuously reassured both indigenes and non-indigenes in the state of their protection and safety,\u201d the statement further added.\n\nCNG\n\nNotwithstanding the clarifications, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) insisted there were \u201cunrelenting attacks and killings of northerners passing through or residing among Igbo communities as minorities.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Tuesday by the group\u2019s spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, the CNG said: \u201cWe note that hate campaigns and propaganda being conducted by created by certain interest groups in the South-east in the form of regional and ethnic agitators have emboldened the outlawed terrorist IPOB/ESN to carry out these unprovoked evictions, attacks, killings, destructions of properties and other forms of violations against northerners in various parts of the South East.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly disturbed by the reports of the brutal murder of a mother and her four children for the only sin of being northerners. This followed other reports that some trucks conveying goods to the South were also set ablaze in Anambra at the weekend and the drivers and other occupants were killed, injured or disappeared without a trace.\n\n\u201cIn sets of gory video clips trending online and seen by CNG, the victims were seen lying in the pool of their blood with bullets spread around and a narrator speaking in Igbo saying, \u201cEverybody should look at this video that they have shot a woman and her four children. They are from the North. And they are shooting everybody they see on the street; so people should be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we also note the manifestation of a dangerous conspiracy of silence when days after the Sunday\u2019s killing of the northerners without any provocation, the story has not been told by any of the national print and broadcast media despite wide coverage by the social media with graphic photos of the mayhem and condemnation by security operatives, groups and individuals.\n\n\u201cWe have watched and studied these events carefully and with considerable restraint and maturity, to the point of condoning and accommodating several unreasonable and unacceptable actions that have been perpetrated against Nigerians collectively, and northerners in particular.\n\n\u201cThe intrinsic bias of the media and the double standards, hypocrisy and cowardice of regional, traditional, cultural, political and religious leaders from both the South and the North have become more glaring when they condemned the Deborah incident in Sokoto but conspiratorially and deliberately decline comments on the murderous activities of IPOB/ESN terrorists including the slaughter of a legislator.\n\n\u201cWe note also the deliberate attempt by the media and southern leaders to conceal the true identity of the murderous IPOB/ESN terrorists by concealing it as \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 while in actual sense they are known.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the activities of the IPOB/ESN terror groups are supported morally and politically by the vast majority of the pliant Igbo elites, politicians, traditional rulers, business persons, and the larger population of this ethnic group. It is also a situation that feeds on the docility of the affrighted section of those who pose as Northern leaders today.\n\n\u201cThe recent attacks have pushed matters to a point whereby silence has become complicity and inaction is no longer an option, making it impossible for us to remain indifferent or silent in the face of such extreme provocations.\n\n\u201cAs the representatives of various interest groups from Northern Nigeria, the CNG today declares enough is enough. The North will no longer remain passive under such deliberate and sustained attacks on its people and interests, and will henceforth be forced to react to every provocation and unwarranted violation,\u201d the statement said.\n\nCAN hits IPOB\n\nSimilarly, the Kaduna state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the alleged killing of the northerners in Anambra state.\n\n\u201cThis unfortunate act is getting out of hand. IPOB members are murderers, cowards and sub-humans who oppress the innocent and kills children. FG should treat them same way as Boko Haram,\u201d said CAN in statement by its state chairman, Rev Joseph John Hayab.\n\nWhile praying for the repose of the soul of those killed, CAN said: \u201cWe have read the story of the Killing of Fatima, her unborn child, and four children in Anambra with sadness and disappointment about how evil activities have expanded in our country while good people are divided and silent.\u201d\n\n\u2018Life in our country has become so cheap with the raising of many evil criminal groups in every part of the country. Killings of human beings are no longer a serious matter because the people have been divided by tribe, region, and religion which have made it impossible for us to collectively condemn the evil around us or fight the evil we are seeing as a united force.\u201d\n\n\u201cCAN sees the massacre of Fatima, her unborn child, and four children by criminals and terrorists in Anambra as bad for Nigeria\u2019s peace and unity.\n\n\u201cCAN cannot keep quiet when evil is destroying the land. We all must know that when there is an injury to one then that injury is to all and evil only triumph when good people keep quiet and look the other way,\u201d the statement further said.\n\nHayab further said: \u201cCAN therefore is urging the federal government to go after Fatima murderers and all others who have killed any Nigeria from any region or of any identity.\n\n\u201cUntil our Government and our law enforcement agencies go after all criminals and murderers and justice is seen to have been done on all murderers this evil will not stop and the murderers will not see their crime as evil but instead, they will smartly make us fight amongst ourselves and pay less attention to their crime.\n\n\u201cCAN Kaduna state commiserates with Fatima\u2019s family and pray to God for comfort. CAN will also continue to preach peace, pray for peace, and speak truth to power and against every wrongdoing in Kaduna state and Nigeria as a whole. Because we believe that an injury to one is an injury to all. May God deliver Nigeria from bloodthirsty criminals.\u201d\n\nCSO reacts\n\nIn a reaction, Executive Director, OJA Development Consult, author, columnist and public affairs analyst, Jide Ojo, said \u201cour authorities have made the country ungovernable and unsafe for us.\n\n\u201cThese criminality should have been dealt with. Even in the South-east, their own citizens such as Chike Akuyili, the two soldiers and also a lawmaker, amongst others, were all murdered in cold blood.\n\n\u201cThey are not just targeting the northerners but the authorities should live up to its expectations, according to Sec 14, Sub section 2B of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which talks about security and welfare of citizens being the primary purpose of Government, then we will not have the problem on our hands because an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth will have everybody blind and toothless.\n\n\u201cIf the country goes on a vengeance mission, we will just create an additional problem for this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlready, Nigeria is the Third most terrorised country in the world .The government needs to do the needful, they have the instruments of cohesion, they should go after all those criminal elements in the South-east and all over the country.\n\n\u201cLook at the recent Dei-Dei issue; it is snowballing and worrisome that these pockets of violence may escalate as we approach 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIt lies with the people in authority to do the right thing and deploy intelligence gathering. They need to be more proactive before some of these things get out of hand. When there is ethnic profiling, it has a spiral effect anywhere it happens.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why there are a lot of suspicions between the two major ethnic groups and it is affecting our politics. These are things that could change if we dealt with criminality not minding where the person is from. We need to know that it is not only the northerners that are targeted,\u201d he further said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "title": "Border Demarcation, A Big Challenge In The Curbing Of Petrol Smuggling \u2013 Customs",
          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "World basketball body FIBA has threatened to sanction Nigeria over its decision to withdraw from international competitions for two years.\n\nFIBA in a letter signed by its Head of Legal, Jaime Lamboy, and dated May 18, 2022, the body said Nigeria\u2019s decision was in breach of Article 9.7 of FIBA\u2019s General Statutes.\n\n\u201cNational member federations shall manage their affairs independently and with no influence from third parties,\u201d the letter addressed to Nigeria Basketball Federation President, Musa Ahmadu-Kida, read in part.\n\nArticle 10.2 of the FIBA Statutes stated that on the initiative of the Secretary-General, FIBA Central Board may suspend a national member federation for the breach of Article 9.7.\n\nREAD ALSO: Ex-Minister Bolaji Abdullahi, Others Emerge As PDP Senatorial Candidates In Kwara\n\nThe implication of the sanction would mean that Nigeria will miss out on the 2024 Olympic Games, as well as the 2025 World Championships for the male and female teams.\n\nFIBA also reacted to a letter earlier written to them by the Ahmadu-Kida-led NBBF board.\n\n\u201cIn such letter, you pre-emptively informed FIBA of the apparent decision by the Nigerian Government (Federal Ministry of Youth & Sports Development) intending to have Nigeria take a break from all international engagements for two years and enabling an Interim Management Committee to run the affairs of the basketball in Nigeria,\u201d the letter read.\n\n\u201cAs you already are aware, Nigeria is due to participate in the following FIBA competitions in the upcoming months: FIBA 2023 Basketball World Cup Qualifiers (FBWC23 Qualifiers) FIBA 2022 Women\u2019s Basketball World Cup (FWBWC22).\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, any withdrawal of Nigeria from the abovementioned competitions will trigger potential disciplinary sanctions as per the FIBA Internal Regulations. Furthermore, if the absence of Nigeria from international competitions for the next two years materialises, the consequences may spread out well past such a two-year period.\n\n\u201cFor example, please note that the withdrawal from the FBWC23 Qualifiers is also a withdrawal from the Paris 2024 Olympic qualification process. Similarly, depending on third-party results, the same situation could apply with respect to FIBA AfroBasket 2025.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we request from the NBBF to immediately inform FIBA whether its participation in the abovementioned competitions is or not ratified.\n\n\u201cWe take the opportunity to remind the NBBF of its obligations to manage its affairs with no influence from third parties, as per Article 9.6 of FIBA General Statutes.\u201d\n\nThis is coming a week after President Muhammadu Buhari approved with immediate effect, Nigeria\u2019s withdrawal from all international basketball competitions for two years, following a lingering leadership rift in the NBBF.\n\nSports Minister, Sunday Dare, had explained that the withdrawal would help the country revamp the sport from the grassroots, as well as put an end to the basketball crises.",

          "title": "Jim Nwobodo backs Peter Mbah to succeed Gov Ugwuanyi",
          "text": "Former Governor of old Anambra State and Senator, Jim Ifeanyichukwu Nwobodo, has endorsed the candidature of Peter Mbah as the governorship candidate of the PDP in Enugu State.\n\nIn his statement Senator Nwobodo described Peter Mbah as a quintessential technocrat with a calm disposition to cope with the rigours of governance.\n\nNwobodo who is easily the one of the oldest experienced politician of his era observed that Peter Mbah\u2019s candour and upwardly mobile experience fits the cap of a personality to galvanize the entities of the State and improve on the economic potentials of the State.\n\nThis came after months of speculations on who will take over from Governor Ugwuanyi in 2023.\n\nBut in less than 24 hours to the governorship primary election, Nwobodo has now revealed that Mbah is the chosen one.\n\nHe broke the news during a press conference at his Amaechi country home, where he also disclosed that another aspirant, Senator Ike Ekweremadu has accepted to support Mba.\n\nHe said he held a meeting with a number of the aspirants from Enugu East for a conversation on how to develop Enugu State.\n\n\u201cThe former governor said, \u201cI don\u2019t usually call for this kind of press conference, but when something when something very important happens, I\u2019d be forced to do so. I jotted a few things down and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll take questions eventually. Ladies and gentlemen I know I\u2019ve addressed you a couple of times about my strong belief that the Governor of Enugu State should come from Nkanu East.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not from Nkanu East but I\u2019m from Nkanu and I know before I come to the main issue, I had invited a number of young men from Enugu East Senatorial Zone for a conversation on how to develop Enugu State. I did that bcos I know there is an understanding among the people of Enugu state that governorship should rotate amongst the three Senatorial zones.\n\n\u201cThat there should be a rotation of ownership among the three Senatorial zones. From my interaction with all of them, I looked at a number of them, and many of them I\u2019ve spoken to and talked to them privately and we\u2019ve held meetings and I was looking for somebody whom I think should re develop enugu state the way it was when I left it. I found a young man whom I never met before but we met briefly and he took me to his office and his business and that young man is Peter Mbah. Peter Mbah is not talkative, it\u2019s not being heard here in Enugu state.\n\n\u201cAs far back as October 2019 to be specific, I invited Peter Mbah to my house. When he came I told him young man I told him young men should consider running for a position in Enugu state in particular the governorship of Enugu state. And I also said, you don\u2019t dwell in the private sector, u have no experience in the government and your from the neglected backward area of Nkanu why not take up this challenge.\n\n\u201cThis was one one of the things that challenged me as a Wawa man to run as governor of old Anambra state when I was 39. I was invited by Zik, the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe to run for the governorship of old Amanda state. And he gave me the reasons. (I\u2019ll come back to that later) Peter Mbah did not say yes or no but said he would give it a thought and came back to me few weeks after and said that he will consider running. So, I said he should go on.\n\n\u201cSince then he has been quietly consulting widely and seeking advice from every important key stakeholder and myself. And based on my experience as the oldest, I repeat, as the oldest politician in Enugu state today and I\u2019m Jim Nwobodo and I don\u2019t know of any politician who is living today who is older than myself both in terms of experience and age. Politicians are very interesting people and they can twist and untwist.\n\n\u201cBut because I\u2019m used to it, I accept when people start claiming what they have not done or what they did. Tomorrow you should be asking why am I keeping quiet?. Tomorrow is the governorship primaries of the PDP and I believe that anybody who wins the primaries of the PDP in Enugu State will be the governor of enugu state. Because this is in fact the only party in Enugu state. PDP is the only part in Enugu state.\n\n\u201cI too have had discussions with people. Those of you who were around last year must have seen the meeting the rally we held organized by Enugu East Senatorial Zone. Enugu East comprises Enugu North LGA, Nkanu East LGA, Nkanu West LGA and Isi-Uzo. Taking about six LGs that make up Enugu East Senatorial Zone. I have also been speaking with the governor of the state, very peaceful man; and I told him, and I believe he heard me, that anybody that will succeed Gburugburu must bring peace, continue with the peace he has set up in Enugu state. We are not going to any war, or into any rascality, or into vandalism and going to handle the government of enugu state peacefully.\n\n\u201cAnd Ugwuanyi has set the pace, comes out\u2026 He looks for nothing but a government job, make me SA, make me SPA\u2026 Make me this or that. But nobody has done anything about working for himself. And any LG or any state of the federation or any country that depends on government will never do well. So we need somebody who will develop the private sector where people can go to do their own work, create\u2026 This is the era of innovation. Start something yourself, run it, make yourself feel proud, don\u2019t depend on government. And this is what I think of very important.\n\n\u201cWhen people say. I don\u2019t know. When people say that I succeeded as Governor, it was because of my experience in the private sector. I had my own company, I built it up. I had branches in London, in Zurich, in USA ask over on my own and it helped me to run the state. If you have no experience in the private sector you would be unable to run a state properly because you\u2019d depend on what you are told by the civil servants. I have heard all kinds of rumors about people claiming they brought\u2026ot I\u2019m sponsoring Peter Mbah.\n\n\u201cI am not going to talk about it because it is unnecessary but I know Peter Mbah also know that. I brought him into this place 2ce in the sense that I started speaking to him about this. I kept quiet because as an elder statesman I don\u2019t need to dangle words with everybody. I know that there will be time to speak. And this is the time to speak. Time to speak because tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow is the D-Day for the primaries. And I plead with all of them that have bought their forms and put their hopes in this thing to get ready for tomorrow. All the delegates who are going, my plea is that you\u2019ll bring a good candidate that you\u2019ll build up Enugu State.\n\n\u201cI speak to the delegates. Since the past one or two weeks I\u2019ve been making peace all over. Ike Ekweremmadu had been here to see me and over been discussing with him about peace. Sang I told him; how can you Ike Ekweremmadu fight against your own party? And I think this is working. I\u2019ve asked him, if they\u2019re is any case in court please withdraw it from the court. Let\u2019s talk peace. Because with peace, you\u2019ll succeed.\n\n\u201cYou see, of you are running a state or any thing, a home if there is no leave you\u2019ll not enjoy it. If in your home you have no peace, you will not enjoy it. So we need peace in Enugu. And that is the legacy the governor of Enugu state Gburugburu has left for us. It is a tall order. So I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m succeeding. For the past five days I have been meeting with Ekweremmadu and I have asked him please collapse your team, you pool, let them join the rest in making enugu state a peaceful state.\n\n\u201cThere are many other people whom I have called\u2026 And I said please, please do not break Enugu State. It is important for you to know that if there is no peace here you pressmen would not be able to practice. If there is no peace in Enugu you would be unable to practice. You be so scared coming out. But outside be to Good that we have a man who has taken the issue of security and peace seriously and who ever is coming out should take peace as important but in\n\naddition build the private sector. I also want to plead with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a plea coming from me, the social media should be kind enough but to abuse and castigate other people, all those people who are older that themselves. I hate to see in the social media all sorts of abuse people who have suffered for enugu state. The social media people should give this people a chance because fantastic lies are written.\n\n\u201cYou could read them and enjoy but because as an old man, I don\u2019t think I would enjoy lies. Perhaps I\u2019m the oldest surviving member of the founders of the PDP, not only in Nigeria but in Enugu state. I\u2019m one of the oldest surviving members. The rest have gone. Since God has kept me alive my job is to talk about peace and unity within the PDP and in Enugu state. Ekweremmadu has been very magnanimous to listen to me and I asked him go and withdraw your cased from court. Go and tell your people; collapse the people\u2026 Let them join the PDP\u2026 I think I\u2019m succeeding. Ekweremmadu also is a major stakeholder in Enugu state, in PDP.\n\n\u201cHe had called down and he is supporting. Two of them have met. Ekweremmadu had met with Peter Mbah and he is supporting Peter Mbah now. As I say this, there may be those who have come to me who also want to be governor of Enugu state but I have not made any thing completely to them because I am looking for somebody who will come in and bring peace. The worst thing that can happen to a state is instability and insecurity.\u201d\n\nOn Ekweremadu\u2019s ambition, Nwobodo said the former Deputy Senate President \u201chas come to see me many times and I told him about the need for peace, I have asked him to withdraw all cases in court so that we talk peace.\n\n\u201cWe need peace in Enugu and that\u2019s the legacy Ugwuanyi is leaving behind.\n\n\u201cI have asked Ekweremadu to collapse his team, let them join the rest in making Enugu to work.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Governor of the State for the way he has piloted the affairs of the State,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "Boris Johnson is facing fresh questions after photos showing the prime minister drinking at an event during a Covid lockdown were published.\n\nThe pictures, released by ITV News, are believed to show the prime minister at a leaving party on 13 November 2020.\n\nThe BBC has been told that at least one person who attended the event was fined, but the PM was not.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police are facing calls to explain why Mr Johnson did not receive a fine.\n\nA government source told BBC News the photos may have been taken by the official No 10 photographer and proved Mr Johnson was there in a work capacity.\n\nThe police investigated two events in Downing Street on 13 November. Asked in Parliament by a Labour MP whether a party had taken place on that date, Mr Johnson said \u201cno\u201d, adding that \u201cI\u2019m sure\u2026all the rules were followed\u201d.\n\nThe Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held\n\nWhat did Boris Johnson tell Parliament about parties?\n\nMeanwhile, a government source has also told the BBC that civil servant Sue Gray may hand her report on parties to Downing Street on Wednesday, followed by a statement in Parliament and a press conference by the prime minister.\n\nResponding to the leaks, Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth said it would be difficult for the PM to reconcile his statement to Parliament that no party had taken place with the pictures and called on Tory MPs to remove him from office.\n\nThe peer and former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, said the prime minister had lied to Parliament and his position was now untenable.\n\nSenior Conservative Tom Tugendhat was also critical telling the BBC that: \u201cSeriousness in government matters. It costs us all. And I\u2019m afraid this just doesn\u2019t look serious.\u201d\n\nFormer justice secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Radio Wiltshire that: \u201cIf there\u2019s a deliberate lie, I can\u2019t see how anybody, including this prime minister, can continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are things we say honestly and genuinely at the time that we believe to be true\u2026 now that\u2019s one thing. Going and deliberately saying X is Y knowing that is the case is, of course, beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nBut Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that while he found the picture \u201cdifficult to look at\u201d, he suggested the presence of the PM\u2019s ministerial red box \u201csuggests he was probably on his way through\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s popped down there to raise a glass and say thank you to a long term member of staff who is leaving,\u201d he said, adding that the police would have \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d the event.\n\nHe also said the prime minister was \u201cmortified\u201d.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman said the prime minister would address Parliament \u201cin full\u201d after senior civil servant Sue Gray published her report into the gatherings \u201cin the coming days\u201d.\n\nThere was support for the PM from Conservative backbench MP Sir Desmond Swayne, who said he believed it was a \u201cwork do\u201d, adding \u201cthat\u2019s what people do at work\u201d.\n\nHe told BBC Newsnight: \u201cNow I understand entirely the public anguish at a time when they were locked down and they were not supposed to be together, but there clearly was a distinction between the workplace \u2013 where people work together and are effectively in a bubble \u2013 and what was taking place outside.\n\nThe prime minister and the Met are under fresh scrutiny after ITV News published four new photographs on Monday which it says were taken at the leaving do for Mr Johnson\u2019s communications chief, Lee Cain on 13 November 2020.\n\nMr Johnson is pictured toasting colleagues while standing by a table laden with wine bottles, wine glasses, food and other drinks.\n\nA second coronavirus lockdown was in place in England at the time the photographs were taken, with indoor gatherings of two or more people banned, except if \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for work purposes.\n\nAllegations about gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall throughout the pandemic led to a Metropolitan Police investigation into 12 events.\n\nThe inquiry concluded last week, with a total of 126 fixed penalty notices being issued to 83 individuals for parties held over eight separate dates.\n\nMr Johnson, his wife Carrie, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak all received one fine each for attending a birthday party thrown in the PM\u2019s honour in June 2020.\n\nBut No 10 confirmed the PM was not facing any additional fines from the police.\n\nThe emergence of the photographs has sparked fresh claims from opposition MPs and others that Mr Johnson knowingly misled Parliament when he previously told them no Covid rules had been broken in Downing Street.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, Labour MP Catherine West asked Mr Johnson in the Commons if a party had taken place in Downing Street on 13 November 2020 \u2013 though it is not clear if she was referring to the event photographed.\n\nThe PM replied: \u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure whatever happened the guidance was followed and all the rules were followed at all times.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister faces a probe by the Commons\u2019 Privileges Committee about whether he lied to MPs. Under government guidelines, ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament are expected to resign.\n\nMPs are also awaiting the outcome of an investigation by Durham Police into a gathering in the city on 30 April 2021 attended by Labour leader Keir Starmer and his deputy Ms Rayner.\n\nSir Keir has said he will resign if he is fined for attending the event.\n\nMeanwhile, questioned about its decision making, the Met has declined to explain why the prime minister was not fined over the leaving party.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats have written to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, urging it to investigate the Met\u2019s probe into events in No 10 and Whitehall during lockdown.\n\nThe party\u2019s deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cIf anyone else had been pictured at a party like this during lockdown, surely this would have been enough evidence for them to be fined.\u201d\n\nThe Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he though the police should \u201cexplain why they have reached their conclusions and provide that clarity\u201d.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman said the Cabinet Office and the police had been given access to information, including photographs.\n\nBBC",
