          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Saturday inaugurated a poultry farm established by the Federal Government in Yobe State and declared that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), committed more resources to develop agriculture than past administrations.\n\nThis is contained in a statement on Sunday by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, titled, \u201cAPC government committed more resources to diversify economy than past govts \u2013 Lawan\u201d\n\nThe Senate President said no past government had invested as much resources particularly in agriculture as the Buhari regime had done.\n\nHe spoke on Saturday at the inauguration of a poultry farm which the National Agricultural Land Development Authority, established at Gasamu, in the Jakusko Local Government Area of Yobe State.\n\nThe Senate President said: \u201cWe have promised to diversify the economy of this country. For more than 50 years, our economy had been dependent on one single commodity and that is oil.\n\n\u201cOil does not provide so much employment opportunities. There could be revenues but definitely not the mainstream opportunities in terms of employment. But when you diversify into agriculture, you would have much more people engaged, especially our youths who today are largely unemployed or under employed.\n\n\u201cSo we are diversifying the economy of Nigeria through agriculture and we have done so much as a country, as a government, in the last six years or so.\n\n\u201cNo previous administration in Nigeria has committed as much fund, resources in agriculture than this administration. And I stand to be contradicted, that if not because of resources that we have put in agriculture sector, Nigeria would still have been importing the food that we eat.\n\n\u201cBut everyone knows that the rice import bill had gone so low, almost to nothing today. We used to spend billions of dollars every year to import rice but we have been producing the rice that we eat.\n\n\u201cOf course we still have to work to stop smuggling of rice into Nigeria. But I want to assure you that the APC administration at all levels of government, from the local government, to the state and federal government, will continue to work for diversification of Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cOnly last month, the National Bureau of Statistics released the report that our economy has grown by 5.01 percent in GDP. That is to show that we are making progress. We are not yet there but we will be there by the Grace of God and all indications are there that we will be there.\u201d\n\nLawan commended Buhar for the approval to establish the farm.\n\nThis, he said, was in fulfilment of the promise made by the President on behalf of APC in 2015, to provide employment opportunities for the youths.\n\n\u201cThis is one way of doing that and this is a very practical way of doing it. We have our youths who will be engaged. Presently, 30 youths will be engaged to manage the farm.\n\n\u201cThis is only the direct employment on this farm. When you look at the indirect opportunities, when you establish poultry farms across this zone, you would have brought in many youths to manage the poultry farms.\n\n\u201cGasamu, because of this project, is now going to be prominent in the Nigerian map. And this is something that is very important for us as a community here.\n\n\u201cIf someone will come from Kano. If someone will come from Imo. If someone will come from Akwa Ibom to buy chicks here, to go and grow them and sell them to make money, why can\u2019t we in this community do the same.\n\n\u201cThat means we should be able to have poultry farms coming up across this zone particularly in Jakusko Local Government.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the immediate benefits and I will urge our people not lose the opportunity and I want to seize this opportunity also to appeal to NALDA that we want the capacity to go beyond 250,000 per annum. I want to assure you that our people will exhaust the 250,000 and they will need more,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NALDA, Paul Ikonne said the farm was established on the mandate of Buhari in order to empower the youths and get the country closer towards achieving food security.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr President has directed NALDA to make agriculture attractive for our youths and for NALDA to produce what we are to eat and for Nigerians to eat what we produce.\n\n\u201cSo we are here today for the commissioning of this 30,000-bird capacity which is specially made to produce Noiler.\n\n\u201cThis centre is like a reproduction centre that will be producing our locally improved birds that will be distributed across the country,\u201d Ikonne said.\n\nHe said the farm had the capacity of generating 850 eggs daily and N1.1 million daily from the sales of birds only.\n\nIkonne said the birds also had incubator centre in order to produce day old that would be used to establish or sent to other poultry houses across the country.\n\nHe said the revenue projection is that the farm center which entire capacity is to have 250,000 birds would generate not less than N400 million annually.\n\n\u201cNALDA Integrated farm estates are meant to empower the community, to develop the land within the community, empower the youths, create employment and reduce hunger in our land.\n\n\u201cSo communities within the country are expected to donate land. Mr President has directed NALDA to establish Integrated Farm Estates in all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria. So these lands are developed for the immediate communities and for the empowerment of the communities,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Yemisi Suleiman\n\nThe recently concluded 3-day hybrid Regional Business Forum organized by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), through its Subregional Office for West Africa (SRO-WA), in collaboration with Compass Global Consulting, marked a significant turning point for the global agenda for Women and Youth\u2019s empowerments in Africa.\n\nThemed \u201cEmpowering Women Youths to Spur Africa\u2019s Transformation Agenda\u201d, the event which kicked off on 21st September at the Lagos Continental Hotel Victoria Island Lagos, brought together sector champions in various industries, who partook in the Regional Business Forum structured around high-level meetings, consultations with Business Champions, the youth, and women in the West African business ecosystems.\n\nThe Forum which is in partnership with more than 350 coalition partners witnessed an immense turnover of positive feedback from the opening ceremony. It started with opening remarks by Dr. Vera Songwe, Under-Secretary-General and ECA Executive Secretary who explained that the purpose of the conversation was how to bring the West African woman to leverage the knowledge, the innovation that exists, leverage the vibrancy they have, and ensure they can take their businesses one notch higher to the global sub-region and take advantage of markets that are further beyond in the east and the west.\n\n\n\nDr. Vera Songwe said \u201cIn a crisis, the first thing we want to do is ensure we prevent good businesses from falling below and focus a lot on retention. Africa, in particular, the West African region, has the population dynamics working for it. The African population is estimated at 1.3 million in 2020 of which over 250 million are the youth and it is estimated that 10 million to 12 million are entering the workforce every year but only 3.1 million of them find jobs\u201d.\n\n\n\nSongwe added that the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) stands to grow Africa\u2019s GDP by an additional one trillion dollars to deliver on what is needed: \u201cfirst unlocking our borders, building value chains, and making sure the African women all work together to create the supply chain for textile, fashion, the agro-industry and essentially grow the value of the products, thereby earning more from that. They can become sub-regional and wider continental and international businesses and not limited to the geographies in which we exist today.\u201d\n\nThe Honorable Minister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed during her session, emphasized why it\u2019s imperative for society to empower youth and women. \u201cWe are hopeful, that this will be an effective avenue for empowering youths and women entrepreneurs and address the unemployment challenges we have in Africa, as well as address the need to create jobs\u201d, speaking on the AfCFTA leverage.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the major gaps in the African educational systems and their effects on productivity, Mrs. Ngone Diop, Sub Regional Director, West Africa Office \u2013 UNECA, said \u201cthe region capacity of innovation remains weak mainly because of the deficiencies in the education systems\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe representative of ECOWAS said that his organization will always be mindful of the roles women and youths play in economic development\u201d. This is to reinstate ECOWAS\u2019 commitment to women and youth empowerment.\n\nThe 3-day event was fully packed with high-level delegates and insightful sessions and speeches that are bound to create major mind shifts to aid women and youth inclusion and advancement in Africa and the world at large.",

The AGM noted that bench fee for outside postings by Resident Doctors has been abolished, however some chief medical directors are yet to fully implement it.\n\n\u201cThe AGM bemoaned the delay in payment of death in service insurance benefit to the next of kin of our fallen heroes despite their sacrifices to the country.\n\n\u201cThey observed with concerns the conditions of our members under different state governments\u2019 employs, especially Abia, Imo, Ekiti and Ondo state governments who currently owe our members twenty (20) months, six (6) months, four (4) months and four (4) months\u2019 salary arrears respectively.\u201d\n\nEnumerating its minimum demands, he added: \u201cafter critical appraisal of the performances of both federal and state governments on all the issues that led to the ongoing strike as stated above, the AGM unanimously resolved by vote to continue the total and indefinite strike action until our minimum demands are met.\n\n\u201cThe AGM in particular demanded that the federal government should ensure the following urgently for the purpose of restoring normalcy to the health sector: Payment of the Medical Residency Training within 72 hours, since the money meant for it is available and verification of the list for payment has been completed; Payment of the arrears of salaries of our members on GIFMIS platform within 72 hours while the migration process continues; Withdrawal of the case against us in court in the interest of peace; Payment of our withheld August and September salaries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should prevail on various state governments to urgently pay arrears of salaries and allowances owed our members in the state tertiary health institutions as stated above.\n\n\u201cThe AGM also urged the federal government to consider universal implementation of the MRTA in all training institutions in the country including those in the states. The AGM reiterated unequivocally especially to the members of the public that we are committed to the smooth running of the health sector, however we can only do so when our welfare is given the desired attention.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on all well-meaning Nigerians to prevail on the government to set aside all technicalities as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari and resolve the aforementioned demands in the interest of the masses and our members who are currently suffering because of the ongoing strike action.\u201d",

          "title": "Chairmanship: More cracks in South West PDP",
          "text": "Ahead the national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) tentatively scheduled to hold next month, there are strong indications that a fresh crisis may rock the South-West zone of the party over who should be the next national chairman of the troubled party. \u2018 Dare Odufowokan , Assistant Editor, reports.\n\nWith leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) holding series of meeting during the week to put finishing touches to plans for the party\u2019s national convention expected to hold either next month or later in the year, stakeholders in the southwest zone of the party are now holding divergent opinion over who, among the aspirants from the zone, should be supported for the national chairmanship position. This is just as another school of thought within the zone is of the opinion that the southwest should jettison the chairmanship slot for the 2023 Vice Presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\nThe Nation gathered that the current situation within the party in the zone is gradually generating a lot of bad that observers fear may lead to another round of confrontations among leaders and chieftains of the party in the southwest. According to very reliable party sources, external interferences from PDP leaders and chieftains outside the southwest is not helping matters as the various chairmanship hopefuls from the southwest intensify their struggle for both local and external endorsements ahead of the 2021 national convention.\n\nAmidst insinuations that it may zone the national chairmanship slot to the southwest, the PDP zoning committee, presided over by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, met on Thursday. The party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) had at its 93rd meeting constituted the 45-member committee to decide on the zoning of all offices of the NWC. While it appears the opposition party is set to compensate the southwest for the alleged ill-treatment it received in 2017 in its quest for the national chairmanship seat, renewed wrangling and intrigues within the party signal a zone that is not in agreement over the matter.\n\nStill a divided house\n\nThe Nation gathered that all efforts by various stakeholders to get the PDP in the zone to adopt a consensus candidate ahead of the convention have failed as the aspirants and their supporters refused to budge. \u201cAll of them are claiming to have the backings and supports of some party bigwigs outside the southwest. Most of them are unwilling to subsume their ambition under the general interest of the party in the zone. It is not true that no effort is being made to address the worrisome disunity with which we are approaching the contest,\u201d a party leader from Oyo state told our correspondent.\n\nFindings also revealed that party leaders like Chief Ebenezer Babatope had called on PDP chieftains in the zone to avoid a repeat of what befell them in 2017 by uniting behind a formidable candidate instead of presenting multiple candidates for the position of national chairmanship at the convention. \u201cChief Babatope specifically warned that the slot my not at the end of the day, be zoned exclusively to the southwest. He suggested an arrangement that will enable party chieftains in the zone to decide on who should be the candidate ahead of the convention,\u2019 our source, who is a zonal party official, said.\n\nAnother PDP chieftain, who spoke in confidence, told The Nation that the Southwest caucus is working hard to put its house in order so as to ensure a victorious outing. He however laments that the reconciliation efforts embarked upon by the Taofeek Arapaja-led zonal leadership appear to have suffered some setbacks since the scramble for the national chairmanship position by some eminent PDP chieftains in the zone started. \u201cI am saying it is not true that we are not working on reconciliation. Immediately we were sworn in, we started reaching out to those aggrieved. We worked hard and we were seeing results.\n\n\u201cBut since this struggle for national chairmanship or Vice Presidential ticket started, the party has been thrown into a fresh, more complicated confusion. I can tell you for free that you cannot even say for sure who is with who, or who is where. The camps have further been broken down and there have been a lot of realignments. A good example is the current situation between Governor Seyi Makinde and Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola. They are currently not on the same page as far as the national chairmanship position is concerned. Don\u2019t forget that they were in the same camp all along before now,\u201d our source added.\n\nFresh cracks\n\nJust as indications emerged that Governor Makinde may have joined the camp promoting the chairmanship aspiration of the former governorship candidate of the party in Ondo State, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede (SAN), some of his well-known political allies within the southwest zone are rooting for some other candidates. Party sources claimed during the week that the Oyo state governor has agreed to join the likes of Vice President Atiku Abubakar to see to the emergence of Jegede as PDP\u2019s national chairman at the convention. The Nation gathered that the development is the outcome of a series of negotiations.\n\nBut former Ekiti State governor, Segun Oni, said PDP leaders and chieftains in the southwest zone were solidly behind Oyinlola in his quest for the PDP national chairmanship position. \u201cThe person that all of us are setting our eyes on is Prince Oyinlola, and he has not yet told us that he\u2019s not going to do it. That\u2019s the man we all want to support for the position of national chairman,\u201d Oni said. Checks by The Nation revealed that the leadership of the party is now divided over the candidacies of Jegede and Oyinlola. Similarly, the state chapter chairmen in the zone are also said to be in disagreement over the same issue.\n\n\u201cAs we speak today, the zonal leadership is unable to speak with one voice on the matter because both Jegede and Oyinlola boast of supporters among us. We are waiting for our leaders in the zone to wade in and resolve the issue amicably so that we all can line up behind one person at the convention. Though Governor Makinde remains the leader of the PDP in the southwest, both Oyinlola and Jegede are not politicians you can push over. So, it is understandable that the situation is as it is. Even in the various states, the state chairmen are hoping to be able to speak in one accord very soon,\u201d our source said.\n\nIntroducing another dimension to the looming crisis, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, immediate past PDP national vice chairman, said the zone is divided into three political zones, which are Ekiti/Ondo Zone, Oyo/Osun Zone and Lagos/Ogun Zone. \u201cOyo/Osun zone cannot contest for the national chairmanship because it has already picked one of the three positions of theNWC that is the national vice chairman, which I contested for, but lost to the former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Taofik Arapaja. So, Osun and Oyo states are out of the picture. If the chairmanship is coming to the South West, it would be contested by Lagos/Ogun.\u201d\n\nSimply put, Olafeso, an ally of former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose, is saying Oyinlola cannot be the candidate of the zone for the national chairmanship. \u201cIf we must go by the principles of equity and justice, Ondo/Ekiti and Lagos/Ogun should present candidates for the position if it is eventually zoned to the South West,\u201d he added.\n\nAside Jegede and Oyinlola, others being named in the struggle for the national chairmanship position of the PDP from the southwest include former Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, immediate past governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, and two-time Lagos Governorship Candidate, Mr. Jimi Agbaje. \u201cI understand there are other people interested in the position. They are also eligible and competent. But wherever the South-West goes is where I will go. I will follow the South-West. \u201cWherever the Yoruba go when the chairmanship position of our party is zoned to the South-West is where I will go. It will not be a do-or-die affair. That\u2019s all I can say for now,\u201d Fayose had said while responding to a question about his rumoured ambition.\n\nAnother dimension\n\nBut as the countdown to the October 2021 National Convention for the election of new members of the National Working Committee (NWC) continues, some stalwarts within the party are said to be insisting that the zone should forget about the national chairmanship and show serious interest in producing either the presidential candidate or the running mate. A source told The Nation that ex-governor Fayose is one of those promoting the agitation for the zone to reject the national chairmanship slot if it is exclusively zoned to it.\n\nFactional chairman of the party in Lagos State, Deji Doherty, is not hiding his preference for the presidential ticket as against the ongoing clamour for the position of national chairman. \u201cThe zone should leave the chairmanship position to the South East, or South-South. We should fight at the national convention, and at the committee, level to get the number two position in the country. That is my own candid position. It is the right time that the PDP should provide a South West vice president. The president in APC is from the North and the vice president is from the South West,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking emphatically on what should be the position of the party on the matter as the convention draws nearer, Doherty said, \u201cIf we are going to zone the president to the North for the first time in the history of the PDP, we should have a South West vice president. Everything is tilting towards that end, and for me, I am looking at a situation whereby the zone gets the slot of vice president.\u201d Not a few people are saying the Lagos PDP chieftain may have spoken the mind of the Fayose camp, given his prominence as one of its leaders in the southwest.",

That\u2019s the report we are getting in all local government areas.\n\n\u201cWe have told our people to be orderly and peaceful. We have already concluded and the results are ready. The security personnel have signed it too.\u201d\n\nA former Commissioner for Environment, Idowu Oyeleke, who is the Zonal Returning Officer for Oyo Federal Constituency in the camp of Governor Makinde, said there was nothing strange about parallel elections, saying that members have the right to hold elections individually or generally\n\nRead Also: APC state congress to hold October 2\n\n\u201cEach group will submit their result, but we will resolve the matter and address the grievances,\u201d he added.\n\nA former Chief of Staff to Governor Makinde, Chief Bisi Ilaka, in his report of the conduct of the election at Afinni Compound Ward 5, Oyo East, said the exercise was peaceful.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy ward is peaceful. Materials (were) delivered on time. We used consensus in the four local governments and the stakeholders were called together to address the issue.\n\n\u201cAll interests have been accommodated and so there is no parallel congress here. There is no violence in Oyo and I am not worried about the parallel congress.\u201d\n\nAlso, a former Deputy Speaker of the State Assembly, Dr Musa Absulwasi, who spoke from the Kinnikinni Ward 6, Saki West said the congress was \u201cpeaceful as the party leaders in the local government have resolved in consensus.\n\n\u201cNo parallel (congress) here and the Abuja committee members have been here today to see for themselves.\u201d\n\nAnother aggrieved member, Bola Akinyemi, said all the aggrieved members resolved to avoid all forms of provocations as they held parallel congresses. He said officials of INEC and security operatives all observed the congress and also certified the results.\n\nHe said there were some skirmishes and accused some yet to be identified individuals of chasing his car and that he made to make a detour to deceive them.\n\nHe said some suspected political thugs also deflated the tyres of people\u2019s cars around the Molete Bridge, thereby causing initial scare.\n\nGovernor Makinde, in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, tasked members of the party to stay united, adding that the time has come for aggrieved members to bring their grievances to the table for amicable resolution.\n\n\u201cFor the PDP members in Oyo State, I want to ask them to stay unified because we can do quite a lot in unity.\n\n\u201cAnd for some who are angry or aggrieved, let them bring their issues to the table, we will address them. Politics is about conflict and resolution of conflict within interaction of people,\u201d he added.\n\nOyo ward congress peaceful, fair, credible \u2014 Shaibu\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Chairman, PDP Ward Congress Committee and Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, said the Committee did not notice any parallel congress in the state.\n\nHe described the ward congresses as \u201cso peaceful\u201d, saying \u201cso far, so good, all the talks of having a parallel election has not been noticed, and what is key today is that the process has been peaceful.\n\n\u201cNo report of any violence anywhere and that is one thing we have been afraid of since yesterday.\u201d\n\nHe assured that the party would settle all internal issues among its members amicably.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, all through the night, we were having discussions and phone calls to some of them that felt aggrieved. We will settle our internal issues and I am happy that we are already discussing.\n\n\u201cWe are here to do the right thing and to conduct a free, fair and credible congress,\u201d he added.\n\nAdeleke, Ogunbiyi\u2019s camps conduct parallel congresses in Osun\n\nThe unsettled crisis within the Peoples Democratic Party, Osun State has resulted in the party holding parallel ward congresses yesterday.\n\nThe warring factions within Osun PDP, made up of the camp of the governorship candidate of the PDP during the 2018 governorship election, Senator Ademola Adeleke, and that of the first runner up, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, had ward congresses conducted separately by Hon. Sunday Bisi and Hon Soji Adagunodo.\n\nThe Congress Committee from the National Secretariat, led by Senator Emmanuel Orker-Jev, during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting before the exercise yesterday directed the members to conduct the ward congress and submit the result to them.\n\nAddressing journalists, a group led by Hon Sunday Bisi said: \u201cThe panel that came from Abuja led by Senator Emmanuel Orker-Jev with his team met the stakeholders of the party and we had a good deliberation. He admonished us to have a peaceful congress which we all agreed to. We went to the secretariat to distribute materials to electoral officers.\n\n\u201cWe are not hijacking the process. As the chairman of the PDP in Osun, I have to make provision for their stay in Osun. We only accommodate the panel that came from the national secretariat.\n\n\u201cThere is no faction in PDP. I am the chairman. I have 30 local government chairmen under me with other executives. The leaders of the party are with me, including three members of House of Rep, three members of the house of assembly. So there is no division.\n\n\u201cIn any society, we have infinitesimal members which are normal in politics. If you have 95% and 5% are agitating, we are above the pass mark.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Hon Soji Adagunodo, who led another group, said: \u201cThe process of the congress has been compromised. The National has taken sides with them, because as at last night, the leadership of the party in Abuja wrote to INEC, Police and DSS that the only party chairman they recognised is their faction Sunday Bisi against everything they promised us. How can that panel be fair?\n\n\u201cWe are having leadership crisis in the state up till now. We are in court. We are in the Supreme Court. We have two cases at the Appeal Court and three cases at the high court based on the leadership of the party. We have conducted our congress.\n\nKwara PDP adopts consensus\n\nThe Kwara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday adopted the consensus option in choosing its executives across the 193 wards of the state.\n\nThe exercise was conducted in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nParty members who participated in the peaceful exercise across some of the wards expressed optimism of winning the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe exercise, which started late in the state, witnessed large turnout by the members.\n\nAt Ajikobi Central Ward, Ilorin West Local Government, the area where the ex-Senate President, Bukola Saraki comes from, party members were seen in their numbers participating in the process of electing their ward executive.\n\nThe party hailed members for the successful and peaceful conduct of the ward congress which was held across the 193 wards in the state.\n\nPDP spokesperson, Tunde Ashaolu, said the leadership of the party was impressed by the turnout and conduct of members of the party during the exercise that was monitored by officials from the national secretariat of the party.\n\nAshaolu said: \u201cAs a party that respects due process and is committed to internal democracy, we welcome the choices made by delegates during the ward congress.\n\n\u201cThe ward congress is part of several efforts we are taking as a party to strengthen our support base at the grassroots and also build a formidable party that is ready to take over power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate leaders, elders and relevant stakeholders within the party, especially our national leader, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki (CON), for their contributions towards the successful conduct of the ward congress.\n\n\u201cWe also commend party members for demonstrating maturity, understanding and cooperation before, during and after the exercise that took place across the state. This is a reflection of the unity, understanding and respect that dwell within the Kwara PDP family.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the same level of understanding and cooperation will be sustained during the forthcoming local government and state congresses.\n\n\u201cThe party congratulates the newly elected party officers at the ward levels and urges them to see their election as a call to serve and further contribute to the growth and development of the party.\u201d",
          "summary": "In some of the wards visited by our correspondents in Oyo State, parallel elections were held at the same venue, creating an atmosphere of fear and anxiety.\nSome leaders of the factional groups admitted in different speeches that parallel congresses were held across the state.\n\u201cAll interests have been accommodated and so there is no parallel congress here.\nOyo ward congress peaceful, fair, credible \u2014 ShaibuSpeaking earlier, the Chairman, PDP Ward Congress Committee and Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, said the Committee did not notice any parallel congress in the state.\nAdeleke, Ogunbiyi\u2019s camps conduct parallel congresses in OsunThe unsettled crisis within the Peoples Democratic Party, Osun State has resulted in the party holding parallel ward congresses yesterday.",

          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor\n\nGovs angry over zoning arrangements, northern presidential candidate\n\nDisaffected National Assembly members also plotting defection\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHorsetrading over the zoning of the presidential ticket and national chairmanship of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is threatening to wreak more havoc on the party, The Nation learnt on Saturday.\n\nFollowing reports that the chairmanship has been allocated to the South by the party\u2019s Zoning Committee led by Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, two Southern governors as well as scores of National Assembly (NASS) members, are said to have commenced plans to dump PDP ahead of its national convention.\n\nSources close confided in our correspondent that dissatisfied with the decision which they interpret to mean an automatic move to forestall zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket to the South, the governors, who incidentally had been approached by the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the past, have resolved to dump their party \u201cbefore it is too late to do so.\u201d\n\nAn aide to one of the governors who is from the South-South, speaking on condition of anonymity said yesterday his principal was extremely sad about the decision of the zoning committee.\n\n\u201cPlans are now in top gear for us to disassociate our state from the ill-advised zoning arrangement. Our governor has made it clear from day one that what we want is the 2023 presidential ticket of the party. That is why no chieftain of the PDP from our state has shown interest in the national chairmanship position,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe has been one of those urging the party to do the right thing. His contributions to the discussion during the recent Southern governors meeting where they all agreed to press their parties to zone the presidency to the South is on record. That is why he\u2019s shocked to see the outcome of the zoning committee\u2019s report, headed by a fellow governor who was also at the meeting.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that APC emissaries had visited his boss earlier in the year with a view to getting him to defect, but as a loyal party man he made it clear the only reason he would leave PDP was if the party failed to give the 2023 presidential ticket to the South.\n\n\u201cHis fears have just been confirmed and those saying he\u2019s on his way out of the party are merely saying what they know will happen next,\u201d the aide stated.\n\nChecks by The Nation further revealed that the concerned governor, while speaking to a parley of selected PDP leaders held at Government House in his state on Friday, insisted that it was impossible for him to campaign for a northern presidential candidate in 2023.\n\n\u201cHe asked how he or the PDP leaders present will explain to their people the reason for backing a northerner at a time the South appears united and resolute in their quest for the presidency, and after eight years of Buhari\u2019s presidency. He vowed to support a candidate from any part of the south, but not a northerner and majority of those at the meeting were in support of this position,\u201d another source added.\n\nOur correspondent also gathered that another PDP governor yesterday while playing host to a delegation of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership in his Southeast state, promised his guests that rather than support a northern PDP presidential candidate in 2023, he will leave the party. The second term governor, while responding to a plea from the delegation for him to back the Igbo presidency agitation, assured them that he remains committed to the agenda.\n\n\u201cThe governor told us that following the surprise zoning of the national chairmanship of his party to the South, many chieftains of the party in the region are unhappy as they fear a plot to deny the South the chance to pick the party\u2019s presidential ticket in 2023,\u201da source who attended the meeting said.\n\n\u201cHe, however, reiterated his determination to join another party if PDP fails to zone the ticket to the South. In fact, in his submission, he made it clear that he and some other PDP leaders in the zone are in talks with another party already.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, some PDP members of the National Assembly are also said to have resolved to leave the party in protest against the alleged plot to thwart the zoning of the party\u2019s presidential ticket to the South.\n\nThere is said to be palpable tension in party\u2019s NASS southern caucus as members demand a categorical statement from the leadership following the zoning of the chairmanship to the South against their expectations.\n\nA member of the House of Representatives from Oyo State who spoke on condition of anonymity said the last time they met, it was unanimously agreed that the caucus would resist any attempt to deny the South the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nMany of the lawmakers were, however, taken aback by reports of the zoning of the chairmanship to the South. He said: \u201cGoing by PDP tradition, it is very clear where the presidential ticket will go if the current arrangement is allowed to stand. Those saying there is a plan to allow all zones contest the presidential primaries are either ignorant of some facts regarding PDP or are being simply mischievous.\u201d\n\nHe raised the spectre of mass defection, saying that several senators and Representatives from the South will be forced out of the party by the development.\n\n\u201cJust expect more defections \u2013 not because APC or Buhari is doing well, but because there\u2019s no way we will face our people and tell them to vote for another northerner after eight years of Buhari. This is not about party. It is not about performance but more about the agitation of our people for fairness and equity which the zoning arrangement represents,\u201d he stated.\n\nPDP governors are set to meet on Wednesday to discuss a wide range of issues confronting the party and the thorny zoning controversy is expected to top on the agenda.\n\nParty sources say the decision to meet follows last Thursday\u2019s meeting of the Ugwuanyi Zoning Committee held in Enugu.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, New York\n\nMembers of the Yoruba nation and the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) on Friday evening invaded the premises of the Nigerian House, Kudirat Abiola Corner, Manhattan, protesting against the President Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nBut the personnel of the New York Police Department were quickly deployed to maintain law and order.\n\nHowever, the police had a hard time controlling the protesters who had resorted in hounding and hauling unprintable names at anyone that came out or went into the Nigerian House.\n\nSome of the Nigerian dignitaries they hounded included the Foreign Affairs Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama, one of his predecessors in office, Babagana Kingibe and the Director General of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nSome journalists were also not spared as some of the protesters accused them of writing \u201crubbish\u201d in favour of the Buhari administration.\n\nThey rained expletives on anyone they saw, including people not connected to the government, but just happened to be present at the building.\n\nThe protesters accused them of being aiding and abetting Fulani herdsmen, who they accused of killing members of other tribes in Nigeria.\n\nSome of them said: \u201cIf you accused this terrorist government, you are a terrorist, you are a thief.\u201d\n\nA Nigerian security agent and member of staff at the Consulate, who could no longer stomach the insults, confronted the protesters, and his action almost resulting into fisticuff exchange.\n\nThey also expressed anger that the police allowed the protesters to step into the Nigerian House property rather than restrict them to opposite or adjacent the building.\n\nSome of the police personnel quickly stepped in and prevented the fisticuffs while others created a wooden cordon around the entrance of the building.\n\nThey thereafter prevailed on the protesters to maintain their distance behind the cordon as they continued to express their anger at the state of the nation.\n\nThe protesters carried banners with various inscriptions, including: \u201cBreak up Nigeria to save lives, Buhari is a life patron of Fulani terrorists, Fulani pose an existential threat to indigenous sub-Saharan Africans, Fulani are terrorists, Free Sowore, drop all charges against him, Stop giving loans to Nigerian government, End Fulani terrorism in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPro- and anti-Buhari protests were constant features throughout the duration of President Buhari\u2019s participation at the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).\n\nThe pro-government protesters who congregated under the name of \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d carried out their solidarity marches around the Nigerian Consulate daily, stressing the need for the country to remain as one.\n\nThey also carried posters, which affirmed that the claim of killings and marginalization were propaganda against the country.\n\nOne of the leaders of Yoruba nation, Foluso Aruleba, who apologized to some of the journalists hounded said: \u201cPlease forgive our people. Their actions are based on the genocide ongoing in Nigeria/ the rate of our naira value to other currencies. We pray for divine intervention. We work and pray, pray and work.

          "title": "2023: God\u2018ll be against Jonathan getting automatic presidential ticket in APC \u2013 Nabena, ex-party spokesman",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer All Progressives Congress (APC) spokesman, Nabena Yekini, has a trademark of bluntly baring his mind on issues in the front burner regardless of who is involved.\n\nEngaging Sunday Sun in this chat, he spoke on the speculated plan to lure former President Goodluck Jonathan into the APC with an automatic ticket, rolling out litany of reasons that will force him to campaign against him.\n\nHe equally reacted to the fall out of the APC ward and Local Government congresses and the controversial zoning formula in the ruling party, announcing that the fact that all the aspirants are from the same section of the country was enough indication of which zone gets what.\n\nDid the pockets of crisis trailing the conduct of APC congresses come to you as surprise?\n\nI was not surprised at all because even in a small family, there are still some little misunderstandings. There is no way everybody can be satisfied and be on the same page at all times. Even in sharing pieces of meat after meal, some people will want to take larger chunk than the other person. Therefore, the situation is unavoidable in a large political family like ours. What should be the major concern of the party leadership is whether they are fair to everybody concerned. We are, however, aware that we have some greedy politicians that still believe in the old system of godfatherism where one person takes charge of the entire state while others must queue behind him. Yes, there are party leaders, but what is obvious is that they can only be in the polling units of their wards on the day of election. The party leaders must wake up to the reality that this party now belongs to the grassroots. They are the people to vote during the elections and in most cases, they are the foot soldiers. They have the powers to make or mar any situation. Sometimes, some of the big names are just Abuja-based politicians after occupying one exalted position previously. What we are seeing today as crisis in the party is a rebellion that can be likened to greedy generals having problem with the soldiers. We are also seeing cases of people in the North going to the South or vice-versa to intervene on issues that concerns another in the name of former colleagues without necessarily understanding the terrain well there.\n\nWho is the real leader of the APC in your state Bayelsa between the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva and David Lyon, a member of APC Caretaker Committee?\n\nThe leader of the party in Bayelsa is not in any contention because everybody clearly knows that Sylva is the leader. It is not about staying in Abuja and making frivolous claims without knowing or understanding the running of the party especially financially in the state. I challenge anybody claiming that Lyon is the leader of the party Bayelsa to ask him if he has contributed a dime to the running of the party. We gave him the ticket of the party to contest the governorship election, ask him if he had come back to appreciate the people that were instrumental to it. People made enemies because of him, but he never cared to thank those that made him the standard bearer of the party during that governorship election. It is even good that he did not make it. Yes, it was by God\u2019s grace that he was elected, but he never cared to return to the people to thank them for supporting him. He never contributed a dime to the running of the party in the state. He is rather receiving sitting allowances among other things from the national. Did he care to know how we raised money to conduct the registration and congresses in the state? How can such person contest the position of who the leader of the party should be? He is just benefitting from the party while others are making contributions to sustain the party. I can tell you on good authority that he is not even contesting whether Sylva is the leader of the party in the state. What happened to him was a blessing in disguise because he would have ended up a big disappointment.\n\nSo, will it still be possible for APC to spring the kind of surprise it recorded during the last governorship election in the forthcoming one?\n\nBayelsa APC doesn\u2019t like joining issues or talking too much. We believe in action and surprising people. Even when they labelled APC an Hausa party in Bayelsa, we took the governorship ticket, a senatorial and two House of Representatives seats. Thunder will still strike twice in Bayelsa in the next governorship election.\n\nHow do you feel hearing the speculation that APC is lobbying former President Goodluck Jonathan for 2023 presidential ticket?\n\nI don\u2019t know who is flying that kite in the first place. If Jonathan must be a member of the APC, he must start registration from his ward and until such registration is done, I will not take the speculation serious. I don\u2019t know the motive of those fronting him, but I can see that he may just be testing waters with his cronies joining the APC now. Maybe he wants to use them to test how the reception will be if he decides to join the party. Yes, the Caretaker Committee chairman is doing his best in providing quality leadership to the party. He promised to bring people to the party, including serving governors, lawmakers among others and he has done that very well, but he must understand that though there is no problem Goodluck joining the party, the motive must be defined. I will deploy everything when the situation comes to offering him automatic 2023 presidential ticket. It won\u2019t come to me as a surprise if he joins and I will not stop him from joining the APC, but I will personally campaign against him if the party offers him an automatic ticket. By the way, having attained the highest office in the land, what is he looking for again joining the APC? Maybe he wants to pursue President Buhari\u2019s record because he never constructed a road to his village while Buhari has done that. In fact, he cannot get APC ticket by God\u2019s grace and I am very sure that God will not even allow him get it. God in heaven will be against him too if he is coming just to do only a tenure and short-change the South-south because of greed and selfish interest. He cannot still do anything in that single term when he could not do in the six years as president. There will be no problem if Goodluck joins the APC as an elder statesman to give advice, but if it is to get automatic ticket, I will not support him.\n\nAre you worried like most APC members the kind of persons coming into the party?\n\nMy worry is that if we continue the way we are going now, Nigeria is going to become a one-party country and it is not good for us and the democracy. Yes, no other party can defeat the APC yet there is the need for viable opposition to checkmate what the ruling party is doing. I was surprised that all the people that abused the hell of APC previously are also joining the ruling party. Let me tell you that APC is surviving even with all the lunatics coming into the party because it is laid on solid foundation. The merging parties and the ideologies made the party strong and despite the crises rocking the party, it has continued to stand solidly. The difference between the APC and PDP is that the latter is like a privately owned company, resulting in the high level dictatorship in the party while APC is made up of different owners joining hands together.\n\nHave you heard that FFK will soon become the spokesperson of the APC?\n\nDon\u2019t forget that the position is by election not appointment. I know that anybody can aspire to be anything, but he must be elected. We will see if he will purchase the form first when the time comes and we will pray if the position is zoned to his side if it is his ambition or desire.\n\nCan you allay the fears of implosion in APC because of the zoning controversy?\n\nYou need to understand how this thing works. First, the stakeholders will meet to dialogue which zone gets what position. But I want to believe that there will not be any serious problem about zoning arrangements because as you can see, all the party members aspiring for the national chairmanship position are all from the North. I don\u2019t understand why people are worried about implosion in the APC because of zoning. Having completed membership registration, ward and Local Government congresses and now looking up to the state congress despite the apprehension, why should people still entertain fears of implosion. With the all northern aspirants for the chairmanship position, there will be no serious controversy about zoning again.\n\nDid you feel bad hearing Baba Ahmed of Northern Elders Forum (NEF) claiming that power belongs to the North?\n\nWell, he is entitled to his opinion. He was exercising his fundamental human right of freedom of speech. How much such a claim will affect the country is what may give Nigerians concerns.\n\nWhat is giving you the confidence that APC will retain power beyond 2023 and what are your fears?\n\nI am not afraid and there is nothing to fear because as I usually say, APC is built on solid foundation and not even the calibre of those coming into the party will affect or stop the party from winning. APC is going to win, however, we will need divine support. All I can say is that there is so much APC government needs to fix before the 2023 general elections. We cannot claim that there are no issues of serious concern engulfing the country when we can visibly see and feel them. There will be problems with winning the election, but we must fix the country, security and economic wise, first to have a country we can proudly call our own beyond the 2023 general elections.\n\nAre you insinuating that the APC has failed Nigerians?\n\nNo. It is not true that APC has failed Nigeria. What I said is that Nigerians voted our party to fix the problems confronting them and the elected leaders must leave the country better before leaving office in 2023. We are not afraid of the PDP because they are no longer a serious threat, but we must fulfil our campaign promises and fix the country. The good news is that we will see a new country by the end of this administration.\n\nWhat is the practical solution to the insecurity ravaging the country?\n\nWe can\u2019t deny that the country is facing security challenges, but I feel that the situation is blown out of proportion most times. The propaganda is more than the reality especially as we are getting close to election year. I strongly believe that the situation is politicised. We are in the era of politicians doing everything to remain in power having enjoyed the pecks of offices. Some of them that cannot go home freely have even made Abuja their homes and that is why traffic is building up too much in Abuja now. Essentially, we are all busy blaming Mr President without asking the governors what they do with their security votes. The insecurity is happening in states where the governors collect millions and billions of Naira as security votes yet they cannot do anything. Some of the governors are even living in Abuja and once the allocation comes at the end of the month, they will use their templates to share it. The bad situation is across party lines. If the state governors cannot secure the people after collecting a security vote they should not put pressure on the Federal Government. If the governors are not in charge of security in their states as they usually claim, how come they are bankrolling the state\u2019s security apparatus like Amotukun and Ebubeagu?\n\nWhat are the chances of APC in the governorship election in Anambra State?\n\nThe chances are very bright for the APC. What is just required is for the party to do the right thing. Anambra people have also tested APGA and seen that APGA has failed them even as an Igbo party. The party could not provide the infrastructure APC has provided for the state. Look at the Second Niger Bridge that was perpetually on paper during the Goodluck Jonathan-led PDP. The major roads in Anambra are receiving Federal Government attention. The APC government has also provided inland ports to enhance their commercial activities. The only thing I want to beg Anambra people is to connect to the centre. Erosion is devastating the state and they apparently need federal attention. It is not true that the APC got it wrong during the primaries as speculated. Yes, Moghalu is in court, but as a party man and even former member of the NWC, he knows how this game is played and how the game works. Yes, the party cannot satisfy everybody, but I am surprised that he is in court.\n\nAs opposition in Bayelsa State, will you say that PDP has failed Bayelsans so far?\n\nThe PDP has failed Bayelsans big time from day one. The state has only eight local government areas, but I don\u2019t know why the state cannot be developed because it has remained a glorified village. What do they do with the allocations that come every month because nothing has changed? There are roads they have been building in the past 16 years. There is nothing on ground to show for the huge allocations the state has received in the past years. Look at what Governor Nyesom Wike is doing in Rivers and don\u2019t forget that Bayelsa was once under Rivers. There are infrastructure in Rivers that Wike cannot take along with him when he lives office. We have to start to hold the governors accountable, especially in sharing monthly allocations.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "I want to redefine African film with African stories \u2013Sandra Bremaud, filmmaker",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nAside being a filmmaker, Sandra Bremaud is also a lover of nature.\n\nAs a teenager, watching actors interpret their roles had fueled her obsession for movies. Indeed, for Sandra, filmmaking is a childhood dream come true.\n\nIn this interview, the graduate of Project Management Technology from Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) recalls her journey into Nollywood, challenges, new project and lots more. Excerpts:\n\nCan you briefly tell us about your growing up?\n\nMy growing up was fun laced with discipline. I grew up in a competitive environment that guided my vision today.\n\nWere you a spoilt child or born with a silver spoon?\n\nNo. I wasnt born with a silver spoon and was not spoilt as a child.\n\nTell us about your journey into filmmaking?\n\nMy journey into filmmaking has been pretty much of self-taught. I believe strongly that if you want to learn how to make films, just go out there and make some films. It all started from my teenage years as a university undergraduate who was obsessed with movies and watching actors interpret every character. So, this is my childhood or teenage dreams come true.\n\nWhat inspired your new movie, April Showers?\n\nApril Showers was inspired by women who are striving and conquering in their fields of work through hard work and intelligence. I felt we are not cheering and celebrating them enough, instead they are being tagged, defined etc. For example, people say \u2018don\u2019t buy that house, men will run away from you oh\u2019. But then, you are over ripe for marriage (laughs).\n\nWhat lessons are viewers expected to take home from the movie?\n\nThe viewers will definitely have something to take home. There are so many angles one can see it from, and that is what makes April Showers a unique movie for every African. It\u2019s a story that was told by an African for Africans.\n\nIs this your first cinema movie?\n\nNo, this is not my first; Love Bane was my first project. It was released in the cinema in December 2020. April Showers is my second project and it\u2019s something I am sure will gain more grounds and give me a step up in the African cinemas.\n\nHow was the experience like on set?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s learning and evolving process; and I am confident that the challenges are making me better and more creative. Hopefully, we are expecting the film in the cinemas by the end of September, as we are currently putting finishing touches to it, to make sure its worth every penny spent.\n\nCan you mention some of the stars in April Showers?\n\nWe have top actors like Enyinna Nwigwe, Lilian Esoro, Pere Egbi, Gbenga Titiloye, Gregory Ojefua, Thelma Ibemere, Anthony Monjaro, Kunle Remi, Priscilla Okpara, Sacha Ekama, Amaka Enoch and many more.\n\nWhat inspired your choice of cast and crewmembers?\n\nI think each character defined which actor got which role.\n\nWhat do you look out for before picking an actor or actress for a role?\n\nCharisma; an actor has to be delightful, appealing and enchanting to the viewers. Understanding human behaviour, some actors are knowledgeable of the human mind, and they know what\u2019s required at a given moment by their audience. Then, I look out for confidence, intelligence, hard work, energy; and the actor must be highly imaginative.\n\nHow has it been as a female filmmaker in a male dominated industry?\n\nIt has been a wonderful experience. It is also very possible to succeed as a female in such environment, despite the challenges. However, such challenges are what keep me going and I\u2019m never intimidated. In a nutshell, my vision is my driving force. I want to help redefine the African film industry by telling our African story the same way an American will tell an American story.\n\nHow was your first experience behind the camera?\n\nMy first experience was amazing, thanks to my director, Richard Omos-Iboyi, and the scriptwriter, Mrs. Pacass Adebayo. Richard guided me; he was very patient with my anxiousness. The cast members were very professional too, and that encouraged me a lot.\n\nHave you ever considered settling down with a colleague in the movie industry?\n\nI don marry oh (laughs), otherwise why not? With what I have seen so far, there are some cool, levelheaded dudes in the movie industry.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Third Force: APC, PDP will crumble before 2023 \u2013 Jackson-Lekan Ojo, APC stalwart",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nA stalwart of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and security expert, Jackson-Lekan Ojo has said that the ruling party does not deserve to win a councilorship seat in the country in subsequent elections following the party\u2019s abysmal performance, pointing out that the party has lost its confrontational forces that gave it the edge to win in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe Port Harcourt-based politician said that the emergence of the new Third Force is an indication of imminent implosions in the ruling party as he identified the growing list of disgruntled members of the ruling party as the brain behind the new group.\n\nIn this interview, the popular security expert also spoke on the ongoing military operations against bandits wreaking havoc in the North and other issues of national significance.\n\nHow would you assess the current military onslaught against bandits in the northern part of the country?\n\nWhat is going on in Zamfara and Sokoto, I will say the military is trying, but then we have to be realistic. In spite of the military operations against bandits, we are still recording abductions and killings. They are killing soldiers, kidnapping the people and are still demanding ransom. Before the military went into this operation against the bandits, they had to shut down the communication system around that axis, but the bandits are still communicating, using drone and other gadgets. That is to say that our military is not capable of confronting these people because I never heard that when the Americans were fighting Osama Bin Ladin that the telecommunication system of the area where they got him was shut down. That\u2019s apart. I will believe we are making progress if the soldiers are able to get these bandits without suffering casualty as we hear currently. Just yesterday there was a case of abduction of students. If we are doing this and schools are still shut down, then what progress are we talking about? To me, there is no serious achievements that can make us joyous and joyful yet.\n\nWhat better approach would you suggest the military should explore since you seem not to be comfortable with the approach being used now?\n\nHonestly, it would have been better if we had been able to nip the problem in the bud. When the numbers of those who were engaged in this criminality were still infinitesimal, they would have finished them at that time and cause them serious reputational damage. But we have allowed their reputation to be built in the sense that a lot of jobless individuals around that axis are already seeing their recruitment into banditry as way of making money and living big. That is why the number of those going into banditry is swelling. However, it is not too late now. I think the concentration of the military, the para-military should go to those area now. As the military are fighting them in the states, let there be robust intelligence gathering in the adjoining states so that those that escaped can be easily apprehended somewhere. For a very long time we have empowered them so much by way of paying heavy ransom. Paying heavy ransom as we have been doing amount to financing their activities. But now if you are fighting and killing them; let\u2019s say you killed 20 and 50 escaped, you have not really done anything well because those that escaped will still go ahead to recruit more people. So, the adjoining states of Kebbi, Katsina, Niger, Kogi, Kwara should be properly policed so that if some of them escape with bullet wounds, the security operatives around those areas could get them apprehended. That is when we will know that we are really fighting a battle. Efforts should not be spared to know their sources of funding, how they get food, water, medical equipment, their arms and ammunition. We need to guard and block those sources. This can only be discovered through serious intelligence gathering.\n\nAs the nation inches closer to 2023, the People\u2019s Democratic Party, which is the major opposition to the ruling APC is battling a serious challenge which is believed to be capable of weakening its ability to provide virile opposition to the ruling APC. What do you make of this?\n\nAPC is not growing stronger either. There are lot of hurdles the APC needs to cross before the ruling party can call it Uhuru. There are lots of implosions gathering within the rank and file of APC. The ward congresses caused a lot of problems in Rivers, Delta, Edo, Osun and Kwara. The local government congresses caused a lot of brouhaha within the party. The state congress will be much louder and I want to tell you that the national congress of the party will be the final straw. A lot of them are in courts in their hundreds and the party has said that those that take the party to court will be dealt with, which means they will be expelled at the most. Where do you think those to be expelled would go? Those people you see in courts are not the real aggrieved members; they are their agents. They have their sponsors who are the moneybags that are financing them in the court. By the time you expel those people and the aims and objectives of their financiers and principals cannot be met, at the end of the day all these people will move to the Third Force. If you would recall, it was the PDP, ANPP, CPC and CAN that metamorphosed as the Third Force to form APC and wrestled power from the PDP, just because they had a lot of disgruntled elements in PDP. This is what will happen to the APC. A lot of disgruntled elements will leave the APC and will team up with the Third Force. What APC is enjoying now is the peace of the graveyard; it is temporary. Between now and December, Nigerians will be shocked what will happen to APC and PDP.\n\nYou seem to exude so much confidence that the Third Force which is less than a week old is capable of wresting power from the APC which has been in power since 2015. What gives you this conviction?\n\nWhat is APC? APC is a conglomerate that has no internal coercion, it has no internal agreement. Today, you can easily identify those who are in CPC, you can identify those who are ACN, those in ANPP and APGA. We can recognise them because they are still sticking with their former parties. There is nothing that unites them together. Let me tell you boldly, it was not the APC that won the last election, the last election was won by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s popularity and such a character is not coming up because you can\u2019t see such a character in APC today for 2023 election when President Buhari who is their rallying point will not be contesting. We know him very well, Mr. President is not somebody that will engage in \u2018do or die\u2019 election, which he did not do during his own elections. He knows that he is now going home to rest. There is no unifying factor in APC any longer. There is no united APC that has the forces of confrontation to withstand any external force coming in 2023. A lot of people you see in APC now are just eavesdroppers who are there to gather intelligence that will be used to damage the party in future; APC is no longer a strong party. But when you see the composition of the people in the Third Force that is coming up now, that will give you a glimpse of how serious the Third Force is. Somebody like Pat Utomi has sound relationship with some APC stalwarts, Prof Adeniran has good relationship with topnotch party members in both APC and PDP. These are the forerunners for some powerful forces within the PDP and APC. They are not coming from nowhere; they are coming from somewhere. They have been journeying with serious political stalwarts in APC and PDP over the years and they are representing the interests of these people. They have been sent to go ahead and set the place for them after which they will come onboard. They are the forerunners of some political bigwigs that I will not like to mention now. To me as a security expert and politician, I have seen the hands of so many people from the APC and PDP in this Third Force. If Nigerians want to exit this quagmire they must not take APC and PDP seriously.\n\nYou have identified lack of internal and genuine cohesion and strength as the major threat to the ruling APC. How does the Third Force intend to get this cohesion and power when it is equally likely going to be a conglomerate of another set of disgruntled politicians that still maintain affinity with their original political parties?\n\nThe genuine power of any political party in Nigeria is money. That is why the idea of Not-Too-Young-To-Rule cannot work in this country. We have millions of youths who are capable of contesting and ruling this country, but do they have the money an ordinary member of House of Representatives has now, no! The political power we are talking about in Nigeria now is nothing else but money. By the time these political bigwigs arrive now and start funding the Third Force, people will queue behind them. Our politicians are already using poverty as a tool of getting the people to queue behind them. Currently, there is no political party with known ideology. But if the Third Force comes up with an ideology it will not take Nigeria a week before they start having soft spot for it.\n\nBefore now you were known as a passionate APC chieftain, but that seems to have changed now. Why the sudden change?\n\nI am still an APC stalwart, but I remain in APC because there is no alternative yet. My sympathy for APC will never becloud my sense of reasoning. APC is not the best party in Nigeria today because it is not really doing what the people expect. When the demonic PDP was in power, Naira was 180 to a dollar, but today it is 580 to a dollar. We flew in aeroplane for N17, 000, but today, it\u2019s N90, 000. Schoolchildren are leaving school for security and economic reasons. If Nigerians are sane people, APC does not deserve to win a councilorship seat in the country again except the party can change for better before next year. So, I am still in APC, but I think I should be waiting. People are looking at the Third Force, whether they can come up as a better platform to improve this nation. But if not, people like us can withdraw from politics and take our families out of this country. If things improve we will return. It has gotten to that stage. I will be ashamed to come out now and claim that APC is trying. Corruption is more endemic now than it was under PDP.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

Noting that NUPENG could not fathom any logical reason for the failure of government to ensure compliance with basic tonnage requirements on the highways, he said the abuse contributes in no small measure to the increasing carnage on the highways with accompanying loss of lives and properties and the continuing damages of the highways.\n\nHe, however, said the union after exhaustive deliberations on all the highly important safety issues, unanimously resolved to resume the suspended action \u201cfrom 8th of October 2021 if the Federal Government fails to address these three key safety measures in view of the fact that our members are usually the first casualties in all these areas of government failures with regard to safety of lives and properties of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Branch Executive Council in session is not unmindful of the pains and discomfort our decisions and intending actions will have on the general public but these are hard and difficult decisions we must take for the sake of our members and even the general public.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Insists national ICT infrastructure adequate for e-transmission of results\n\n*Seeks clear legal mandate to implement scheme\n\n*Says 93% of polling units have internet, GSM capacity to cover outstanding 7%\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nDetermined to conduct credible elections in 2023, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has insisted on electronic transmission of election results.\n\nIt also disclosed that 93 per cent of the Polling Units in the country have internet and GSM facilities to cover the remaining seven per cent.\n\nThe electoral commission further revealed that the result of a 10-year diverse pilot programmes it conducted since 2011 and the discussions it held with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) showed that the national infrastructure is adequate to support the electronic transmission of results.\n\nIn its position paper on the desirability of electronic voting and transmission of results in real-time, signed by the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the electoral body said it had developed adequate structures and processes to successfully transmit election results electronically.\n\nThe commission sought a clear legal mandate for the implementation of the electronic transmission of election results with the Electoral Act amendment.\n\nINEC argued in the position paper dated \u2018September 13, 2021,\u2019 that the \u201celectronic transmission of results will improve the quality of election result management and that our engagement with stakeholders shows that the Nigerian public supports it.\u201d\n\nIn the paper titled: \u2018INEC Position Paper No.1 2021: Electronic Transmission of Results,\u2019 the commission stated that the technology and national infrastructure to support the electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria are adequate.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if the choice was up to INEC, the commission prefers to transmit election results electronically once the necessary legal framework is provided,\u201d it said, adding that \u201cthe transmission of election results electronically is both desirable and doable\u201d.\n\nThe commission argued that the recent debates in Nigeria over the provision of Clause 52 (3) of the Electoral Bill 2021 regarding the electronic transmission of election results \u201chave been marked by entrenched partisan positions, incomplete information, unsubstantiated fears, groundless conspiracy theories, and profound misconceptions.\u201d\n\nIt further stated that it was curious that its perspectives on this very important issue of election management remain either completely absent in the debates or at best misconceived.\n\nINEC explained that in the course of the National Assembly seeking to amend or repeal and re-enact the Electoral Act 2010, a national debate has arisen over the commission\u2019s readiness and the capacity of national infrastructure for transmitting election results electronically.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that none of the sides in this controversy appears to substantially question the desirability of electronic transmission of election results. It seems that only the preparedness of INEC and the capacity of national infrastructure are questioned,\u201d it added.\n\nINEC noted that many Nigerians had called on it to make its position on the issue public.\n\nThe commission disclosed that its positions on the issue were informed by a decade of its technical field experience, piloting, and engagement with critical stakeholders, particularly the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) on electronic transmission of election results.\n\nIt argued that a decade was not a short time for it to determine whether it was ready.\n\nINEC stressed that its intervention in these debates, particularly through its position paper, should not be misconstrued as denuding the powers of any other agency or authority to perform its functions or to hold views on the issues in question that are contrary to those of the commission.\n\nINEC stated that the answer to the question of the desirability of electronic transmission of election results in Nigeria today may be summed up in three words \u2013 trust, efficiency, and safety.\n\nThe electoral body disclosed that the verdict of Nigerians was that a progressive application of technology to election management increases trust in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWhen the commission introduced the biometric register, chip-based voters\u2019 card, and Smart Card Reader (SCR), they were widely acclaimed to be behind major improvements in the quality of elections, particularly in 2011 and 2015. Since then, Nigerians have pushed for more and more reduction in a human intervention that could alter the wishes of voters in elections,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe commission said in line with the aspiration of Nigerians, it has continued to work tirelessly to introduce appropriate, targeted, and safe technology to electoral activities, adding that the most recent was the introduction of online pre-registration for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).\n\nINEC also said the health and safety of people must be paramount in all electoral activities, including elections.\n\nINEC said the conclusion it drew from the \u201cdiverse pilots conducted since 2011 is that the country is ready for electronic transmission of results. The national ICT infrastructure is also adequate for the electronic transmission of results. This is underscored by all the discussions we held with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and the regulator, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), over the ten years of these pilots, but especially between 2018 and 2019. It is important to share the outcome of those discussions to underscore the commission\u2019s conviction about the readiness of the country for electronic transmission of election results\u201d.\n\nOn its engagement with NCC and MNOs, the position paper noted that \u201cINEC has had a longstanding partnership with both MNOs and NCC.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the years, they have partnered INEC in sending bulk SMS, providing shortcodes, assigning e-lines, as well as mapping networks for the use of Smart Card Readers, all of which have been invaluable to the work of the commission. This partnership has continued with the discussion on electronic transmission of results,\u201d INEC added.\n\nINEC noted that on January 30, 2018, its chairman, Yakubu had paid a visit to the NCC and asked for partnership on the commission\u2019s task of conducting free, fair, and credible elections, particularly as it concerns telephony and data transmission support for the electoral process, ahead of the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the two commissions established the INEC/NCC Joint Technical Committee on Electronic Transmission of Election Results, which was co-chaired by Mr. Ubale Maska, the NCC Commissioner for Technical Services, and Dr. Mustapha Lecky, an INEC National Electoral Commissioner,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to INEC, the Joint Technical Committee included all the major MNOs.\n\nIt further disclosed that the final report of the committee signed by the Co-Chairmen and presented August 9, 2018, had noted that mobile networks adequately covered 93 per cent of INEC Polling Units with the capacity to cover the outstanding seven per cent.\n\n\u201cThe committee went on to allocate Polling Units to the four major mobile network operators \u2013 Airtel, Glo, 9Mobile and MTN \u2013 to transmit election results,\u201d adding that a total cost implication of N395,123,000 was worked out for the services covering the cost of SIM, system configuration and integration, system support and data bundle with one-year validity.\n\nIt said the Joint Committee also made other technical recommendations, including the allocation of one terabyte (1TB) of data bucket per 10,000 SIMs per annum by the network operators and configuration of one Access Point Name (APN) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) \u201cby all operators towards INEC platform to enhance security\u201d.\n\nThe committee disclosed that the detailed work and recommendations involving the major MNOs and the NCC as the regulator of telecommunications in Nigeria, profoundly convinced it that electronic transmission of election results was possible for the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cINEC expected to receive a clear legal mandate for electronic transmission of election results with the Electoral Act amendment that was ongoing at the time to commence implementation. Unfortunately, that did not happen,\u201d the position paper added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "SANs Tackle Malami, Insist VAT Not on Exclusive List",
          "text": "Gboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nSenior lawyers yesterday faulted the claim by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), that the Value Added Tax (VAT) is on the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nIn an interview in New York, Malami was quoted as saying that no state has the power to lay claim to the collection of the VAT across the federation.\n\n\u201cA lot has precluded the state from collecting value-added tax. One, generally speaking, as you rightly know, the issue of the Value-Added Tax is an issue on the Exclusive Legislative List,\u201d Malami said.\n\n\u201cAnd the implication of being in Exclusive Legislative List matter is that only the National Assembly can legislate on it. The question that you may perhaps wish to address your mind on is whether there exists any national legislation that has conferred the power on the state to collect VAT. And my answer is \u2018no\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a law passed by the national assembly in that direction, no state can have a valid claim to a collection of Value-Added Tax.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility, right and constitutional power to legislate on a collection of VAT is exclusively and constitutionally vested in the national assembly and not in the state,\u201d Malami reportedly explained.\n\nBut in separate interviews with THISDAY, some senior lawyers challenged the minister to point out where VAT was mentioned in the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).\n\nHuman rights lawyers, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Dr. Mike Ozekhome (SAN), and Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), among others, faulted Malami in separate responses to THISDAY\u2019s inquiries.\n\nBut another senior lawyer, Mr. Ahmed Raji (SAN) expressed the belief that Malami was misquoted, not heard properly, or misrepresented in his claim that VAT is on the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nOn his part, Mr. John Baiyeshea (SAN) said whether it is the federal government or the state that is legally empowered to collect VAT, is a decision of the court and not the AGF or any lawyer.\n\nThe collection of VAT has been a subject of national debate since Justice Stephen D. Pam of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt ruled that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) lacked the power to collect taxes not listed under Items 58 and 59 of Part I of the Second Schedule to the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe FIRS had challenged the decision of the Federal High Court at the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division.\n\nThe appellate court had ordered the Rivers and Lagos State governments to maintain the status quo, pending the resolution of the legal dispute on the matter.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision of the appellate court that directed all parties to maintain the status quo, the Rivers State Government approached the Supreme Court, asking it to set aside the decision of the appellate court.\n\nCiting different judicial precedents and constitutional provisions to disprove Malami\u2019s position, Falana said the constitutional powers and competence of the federal government \u201cis limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains which does not include VAT.\u201d\n\nFalana argued that in both E.C. Ukala versus FIRS and Attorney-General of Rivers State versus FIRS, the Federal High Court held that there \u201cis no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology Levy in Rivers State or any other state of the federation.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the human rights activist contended that the federal government \u201ccannot collect VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, argued that the two decisions \u201ccannot be faulted on legal grounds. Until the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court sets them aside, to that extent, the decisions of the Federal High Court remain the law and as they cannot be impugned by any ex-cathedral statement or political opinion of any public officer, no matter how highly placed.\u201d\n\nFalana said since it would be problematic to set aside the judgments of the Federal High Court, the federal government might wish to embark on a consultation to let all the stakeholders appreciate the need to have a central collection system through the FIRS.\n\nFalana, a former President of the West African Bar Association (WABA), however, observed that the federal government should be prepared to review the unjust distribution formula if it wanted the FIRS to collect the VAT.\n\nFalana said in 2020: \u201cThe total VAT collected was N1.53 trillion. Apart from the allocation of 15 per cent to the federal government, the FIRS deducted four per cent as a collection fee while the Nigeria Customs Service deducted seven per cent from import VAT. There are some criteria involved in the distribution of FIRS that ought to be reviewed.\u201d\n\nFalana argued that having acknowledged the lacuna in the Constitution, the FIRS had mobilised the National Assembly to amend the law, noting that the attempt to use the federal legislature \u201cwill not work, as it is a non-starter.\n\n\u201cIn Attorney-General of Ogun State versus Aberuagba, the Supreme Court stated categorically that the Sales Tax Law of Ogun State was invalid as it encroached on the exclusive legislative powers of the federal government. That was the prevailing situation in the Second Republic. But the judgment is not applicable under the current political dispensation.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the VAT cannot be located in either the Exclusive or Concurrent Legislative List. Hence, it is a residual matter within the legislative competence of the House of Assembly of each State of the Federation,\u201d Falana noted.\n\nHe, however, explained that the federal government might wish \u201cto propose an amendment to the Constitution by putting VAT in the Exclusive Legislative List since another constitutional review is in progress.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to point out that VAT was increased by the National Assembly last year, albeit illegally. But the increase has not had any positive impact on the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe essence of paying VAT and other taxes has long been defeated as governments have abandoned the provision of social amenities for the people,\u201d he said.\n\nFaulting Malami\u2019s position yesterday, Ozekhome observed that the VAT \u201cis not anywhere reflected in the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe senior advocate noted the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt Division held that the VAT was not a matter within the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nHe, therefore, added that the VAT \u201cis a matter, which the state governments can or should legislate upon. As a result, there is now a law in Rivers State, which makes VAT an exclusive matter within the jurisdiction of the state. That is the present position.\n\n\u201cSo, the mere pronouncement of the attorney-general in the faraway US cannot change the law, neither can it change an extant subsisting judgment of a competent court of law, which has not been set aside by the Court of Appeal. And that remains the law.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Adegboruwa reinforced Ozekhome\u2019s viewpoint, challenging the AGF to explain why the FIRS wrote a letter to the National Assembly to list the VAT on the Exclusive Legislative List if it was already there.\n\nHe, therefore, contended that the VAT \u201cis not on the Exclusive Legislative List at all. If indeed it were on it, why would FIRS write a letter to the National Assembly, seeking to put VAT on the Exclusive Legislative List?\u201d\n\nThe senior advocate added that all states across the federation \u201care thus entitled to make laws on VAT, through their various Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is the best way to end the controversy on the VAT. The federal government has no power in law to dabble into any matter that is not within its competence,\u201d the senior advocate explained in his three-paragraph.\n\nAnother senior lawyer, Mr. Ahmed Raji (SAN) observed that a court of competent jurisdiction \u201chas made a pronouncement which has been appealed. The matter is subjudice. The golden rule in ethics is that the appeal court should be allowed to rule before any further comments for or against\u201d.\n\nRaji expressed the belief that the AGF was misquoted, not heard properly, or misrepresented.\n\nHe, however, advised that all parties should focus their attention on the contents of their brief of arguments to be filed before the appeal court or Supreme Court as the case may be.\n\nSimilarly, Baiyeshea (SAN) said whether it is the federal government or the state that is legally empowered to collect VAT, is a decision of the court and not the AGF or any lawyer.\n\nThe senior advocate noted that he would not want to make the same mistake by the AGF by commenting on a case that is already before the court,\n\nBaiyeshea said: \u201cI will not like to make the same mistake with Malami by commenting on a matter that is before the Court of Appeal presently.\n\n\u201cAll lawyers and indeed senior lawyers should know that we are not permitted to comment on or express an opinion on subjudice matters.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, whatever the AGF has said will not matter. What matters is the decision of the superior court (in this instance, the Court of Appeal), which we are all waiting for. The matter will not stop at the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cIt will certainly get to the Supreme Court. Whatever pronouncement the Supreme Court makes (based on interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Constitution), will eventually be the law. Therefore, what the AGF or any other lawyer or persons have said or may say, will at best be speculative opinions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022UBA publishes names, account details of forex defaulters\n\nNume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nAThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has disclosed that the apex bank\u2019s interventions to protect the economy from the impacts of COVID-19 represented 3.5 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP was estimated at $432.29 billion by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThis is coming as the United Bank for Africa (UBA) has published the names and account numbers of some customers who allegedly defied the forex policy of the apex bank.\n\nEmefiele stated this yesterday in Lagos in his keynote address on the occasion of the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) 2021 Annual Conference and 30th Anniversary Celebration with the theme: \u2018Financing Infrastructure and SMEs for Inclusive Growth in the Post-COVID-19 Economy.\u2019\n\nThe CBN governor who was represented by the Director, Corporate Communications, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, said the conference provided an opportunity to share the CBN\u2019s experiences at boosting the economy by stimulating investments towards the development of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on key economic variables, the CBN took several measures to mitigate the long-term effects on the growth prospects of the economy. First, policy measures were introduced to restore stability in the economy by supporting households that have been severely affected by the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAlso, targeted interventions were introduced to support critical sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing, energy, and health. Cumulatively, the bank\u2019s intervention efforts represented about 3.5 per cent of the GDP.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said that the CBN has equally developed and introduced low-interest and long-term finance interventions in tandem with the gestation periods of infrastructure projects in line with the bank\u2019s developmental mandate to stimulate finance for infrastructure development in Nigeria.\n\nThe design of the interventions, according to him, was hinged on the need to develop enabling infrastructure in critical sectors to drive economic growth and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo fast-track, the development of infrastructure in the power and aviation sectors, the Power and Airlines Intervention Facility (PAIF) disbursed N312.77 billion to 73 projects to stimulate investment in the sectors, improve power generation, support retention of sustainable jobs and enhance the living standard of the citizens through improved access to electricity.\u201d\n\nEmefiele acknowledged that the current level of infrastructure deficit in Nigeria \u201cis a major constraint to economic development and attainment of growth average rate of at least five to seven per cent required to boost productivity and sustainable growth for businesses.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the World Development Indicators (2019), which said that 56.20 per cent of Nigerians have access to electricity, while electric power consumption stood at 144.52 kWh per capita as of 2018.\n\nHe added that \u201cwhile infrastructure deficit in Nigeria is estimated to be about 1.2 per cent of GDP, it is projected that the federal government needs to commit about $10billion annually to address the nation\u2019s infrastructural deficit.\u201d\n\nThe central bank governor stated that lack of access to quality infrastructure has been a limiting factor to MSMEs potential for growth and creating employment.\n\nEmefiele said access to finance remained one of the biggest threats to MSME development with serious implications for productivity, economic development, and job creation.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit has been identified as a critical enabler for the growth and development of MSMEs, as the overall credit gap for MSMEs in developing countries is estimated to be $5.2 trillion, representing 19 per cent of these countries\u2019 cumulative GDP. Of this, the unmet financing demand from MSMEs in sub-Saharan Africa is about $331 billion, representing 18 per cent of the potential demand for credit by MSMEs in the region.\n\n\u201cWith over 42 million MSMEs in Nigeria, contributing 49.78 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP, 7.64 per cent of exports, and employing 76.5 per cent of the workforce, the sector is faced with numerous challenges that continue to limit the enterprises\u2019 potential to contribute to economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nEmefiele referred to a PwC report, which said that access to electricity accounted for the major share of costs to daily operations of MSMEs, adding that the energy sector is overwhelmed by a plethora of challenges that ranged from operational inefficiencies to infrastructure deficiencies, which have resulted in inadequate electricity supply to households and businesses in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis has contributed significant economic costs to MSMEs, thus hampering their competitiveness and contribution to economic growth. Specifically, the IMF has identified a lack of access to reliable electricity which costs the Nigerian economy an estimated $29 billion annually.\n\n\u201cThe financing gap for MSMEs in Nigeria is estimated to be about N617.3 billion annually pre-Covid-19 pandemic, as less than five per cent of these businesses have access to adequate finance to support their working capital and business expansion needs (PwC).\n\n\u201cOther constraints to MSME development in Nigeria, as noted in the survey, included difficulty in finding customers, infrastructure deficit, insufficient cashflows, multiple taxations, regulatory burden, and sub-optimal implementation of the provisions of the MSME policy,\u201d he said.\n\nUBA Publishes Names, Account Details of Forex Defaulters\n\nIn another development, the UBA has published the names and account numbers of some customers who allegedly defied the forex policy of the CBN.\n\nThe individuals were said to have applied for Personal Travel Allowance (PTA) and bought cheap dollars at the bank but did not use it for the purpose.\n\nThe account numbers and Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) of the defaulters were included in the publication on the bank\u2019s website.\n\nAccording to the bank, the beneficiaries committed the offence after applying for fake tickets or visas.\n\nThe UBA disclosed this in a publication on its website titled \u2018CBN FX defaulters,\u2019 at the weekend.\n\nIt stated that it took the step \u201cIn compliance with the directive of Central Bank of Nigeria mandating banks to publish the names of defaulters of the forex exchange regulation.\n\n\u201cBased on regulatory directives, the following customers cancelled their trips and failed to return the PTA availed to them despite several emails, text messages and follow up phone calls.\u201d\n\nThe bank added that the customers presented fake visas to apply for PTA.\n\nBanks had earlier sent messages to their customers to notify them that travellers who bought foreign exchange from banks for travel purposes but failed to embark on the trip two weeks after their scheduled travel date must return the forex to the banks.\n\nAccording to the banks, this was a directive from the CBN.\n\nThe banks had also disclosed that defaulting customers who presented fraudulent travel credentials or cancelled their tickets and failed to refund the purchased PTA and BTA within two weeks, as stated in the signed customer declaration form, would have their identities and bank verification numbers published.\n\nThe CBN had in a circular to all banks dated August 30 and signed by the CBN Director, Banking Supervision Department, Mr. Haruna Mustafa, stated that the trend if not curbed, presented a risk to the integrity and stability of the forex market.\n\n\u201cCBN, therefore, directed banks to publish on their websites within two weeks the names and BVN of defaulting customers who presented fake travel documents or cancelled their tickets and failed to return the purchased PTA/BTA, as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed by them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the end of bankers\u2019 committee press brief, the Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, had noted that: \u201cBanks have been criticised for not being able to handle PTA and BTA transactions and just to let people know that we would continue to exercise the due diligence required concerning KYC and compliance.\n\n\u201cFX is a scarce resource, so if we find people coming up with tickets that have expired or tickets that are going to be cancelled, or illegitimate passports or people buying more than they are supposed to buy, they will be reported to law enforcement agencies. People should comply with the rules as stipulated by the CBN.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chinedu Eze in Lagos and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, yesterday debunked statements suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccines administered in Nigeria were not approved by the UK.\n\nShe added that the claim was \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d and should be disregarded.\n\nThe UK has also moved Nigeria to the \u201crest of the world\u201d travel list about the travel rule billed to take effect from October 4, 2021.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Laing said the UK approves of vaccines currently in use in Nigeria irrespective of the manufacturer.\n\nShe said that Nigeria is on the \u201crest of the world\u201d list, with simplified travel measures.\n\nShe said the UK has so far donated 1.2 million vaccines to Nigeria through COVAX and will continue to support the country in accessing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe encouraged all eligible Nigerians to get vaccinated to help stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThe UK is committed to global access to vaccines and is among the largest funders to COVAX. The UK has donated 1.2 million vaccines specifically to Nigeria through COVAX and will continue to provide support,\u201d Laing said.\n\n\u201cThe UK strongly supports the work of the Nigerian health authorities and Nigeria\u2019s vaccination campaign, and strongly encourages all eligible residents in Nigeria to get vaccinated. Only once we are all vaccinated can we end the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI would like to emphasise that any statements that COVID-19 vaccines administered in Nigeria are not approved by the UK are completely untrue. The UK recognises the Oxford-Astra Zeneca, Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines used in Nigeria, irrespective of where they are manufactured.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about rules concerning international travel to the UK, the high commissioner said the UK is using the COVID-19 vaccination certification process to ensure people enter the country safely.\n\nShe said from October 4 the current travel system would be simplified and Nigeria which is currently on the amber list will be added to the \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list with simplified travel measures.\n\n\u201cThe UK is committed to opening up international travel and we are using our COVID-19 vaccination certification process to enable those wishing to enter the UK to do so safely. We know these matters hugely to many people in the UK and Nigeria \u2013 the extensive people-people ties between our two countries are at the heart of our bilateral relationship,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFrom 4 October, the current system will be simplified. There will be a single red list of countries and territories where stricter rules apply, and there will also be a \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list, with simplified travel measures. The \u2018rest of the world\u2019 list will include countries currently on the UK\u2019s amber list, such as Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that the UK Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps, had on September 17, 2021, announced a simplified system for international travel in light of the success of the country\u2019s domestic vaccine rollout that provides greater stability for industry and passengers.\n\nThe UK proposed to replace the current traffic light system with a single red list of countries and territories to protect public health.\n\nTesting requirements would also be reduced for eligible fully vaccinated travellers, who will no longer need to take a Pre-Departure Test when travelling to the UK from 4 a.m. of October 4.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "New local power distribution centres colloquially called 'Private NPEA' are emerging in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, to solve the persistent power outage and blackout in most areas in the state.\n\nNEPA, in full the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), is the defunct organisation that governed the use of electricity in Nigeria.\n\nInvestigations showed that those operating the local power distribution centres are private business owners who own lister diesel power generating sets and are willing to share with residents at a cost depending on your needs.\n\nSome residents of Azikoro Village, Ekeki and Azikoro road, who spoke with newsmen, said although the owners of the local power distribution companies did not start with the intention of distributing power \"they were prevailed upon to help their neighbours\".\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that most residents have started patronising the local operators due to the spate of violent crimes arising from the abysmal failure of the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company (PHED) to supply power to homes.\n\nFor example, areas such as Imgbi Road, Ekeki, Azikoro Road and other parts of the state have been in total darkness for five days without proper explanation from PHED.\n\nOthers have even taken to town criers to urge residents not to pay any bill brought to them by the power distribution company. They threatened to deal with any PHED official who approaches their streets.\n\nAnother factor responsible for the patronage of local power distribution outfits is the illegal increase in pump price of fuel and man-made scarcity created by petroleum marketers in the state. A litre of fuel in the Bayelsa capital now is N160 and it is not easily available.\n\nThe patronage of these local power distribution companies is rising by the day, with small business operators and private resident owners struggling to be connected.\n\nIt was gathered that while some local distribution centres take between N2,000 to N6,000 per week for private and commercial use, others have taken advantage of inflating cost of issuance of forms, weekly payment and connection fee to N20,000.\n\nA man, who identified himself as James, told SaharaReporters that he patronises the local distribution company known as 'private NEPA' in his area due to the convenience.\n\n\"They distribute power at your convenience,\" he said. \"If you operate a business, they connect you for a fee between 8am to 6pm. If it is private, you can negotiate for 7pm to 6am. Itsaves you stress.\"\n\nAttempts to get one of the operators close to Ekeki Park failed, as everyone refused to comment. But one of his agents told SaharaFReporters that the distribution of power to neighbours is not a crime.\n\n\"We're only helping our neighbours,\" he said.\n\n\"And fees taken are just for running cost of diesel and maintenance. If the federal and state governments have failed to supply power and Bayelsa is in perpetual darkness, what do we do? In some areas, people are gathering money to buy diesel generator to power houses on their street. They don't even bother to pay light bill and they asked Power Holding to disconnect them.\"",

As winners, each of the startups gets \u20a6500,000 worth of TechCabal coverage.\n\n\u201cFor my team and I, winning at the pitching session validates our vision for the future of e-commerce in Africa, that is, conversational and social commerce,\u201d Ronald Tagoe, Founder of ChatBots Africa, told TechCabal. \u201cWe are very elated by this validation and look forward to an exciting future.\u201d\n\nBased in Kenya, ChatBots is a multi-channel bot platform that allows companies to use AI chatbots on WhatsApp. According to the company, the solution is built for all ranges of experiences; from the complete newbie to the advanced user.\n\nAccording to Tagoe, the startup won because the solution and business model were \u201cvery clear and the customers\u2019 pain point was something the judges gravitated towards.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor Wunmi Akinsola, CEO and founder of Fashtracker, winning the investment pitch session represents \u201ca major validation\u201d for the startup.\n\nNigeria-based Fashtracker connects trusted and sustainable African fashion brands to people within and outside the continent through its online platform. \u201cWe aim to be the go-to fashion destination within Africa, and globally, for African brands,\u201d a statement on the company\u2019s website reads.\n\n\u201cI feel super motivated to keep building Fashtracker,\u201d the elated founder said. \u201cThe fact that Techcabal, the investors, and other stakeholders involved bought into the idea from a 2-minute pitch is a major validation that is a necessary component for the success of any startup.\u201d\n\nAkinsola believes certain factors propelled the judges to select the startup as the winner; such as the fact that the African fashion marketplace is \u201crelatively untapped and is a huge opportunity\u201d considering the barriers to entry such as logistics, payments, and scale, are already being solved.\n\n\u201cThere are too many opportunities for scalable integrations including menswear, skincare, B2B, Saas, VAS, and this could all be on a Pan African/Global-scale if done right,\u201d she adds.\n\nIn addition, Akinsola notes that startups like Fashtracker have the capacity to alleviate thousands of creatives, and fashion entrepreneurs economically. \u201cEspecially during such tough times in Nigeria \u2013 economic prosperity is key.\u201d\n\nA screenshot of ChatBots Africa website. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nTagged the #FutureOfCommerce2021, the high-production event enabled registered stakeholders to learn the shifts in the industry and buying behaviour, and how they can better prepare to take advantage of the rising tide, whether as organizations or individuals.\n\nThe hybrid conference brought together startups, investors, banks, telecoms companies, FMCGs, policymakers, small businesses, tech enthusiasts, and everyday consumers to discuss their thoughts and predictions around all the changes coming to how people buy and sell on the continent.\n\n\u201cThe organisation (TechCabal) is top-notch and the ideas and insights shared were thought-provoking,\u201d Tagoe said when asked about the Future of Commerce. \u201cThumbs up to the team.

          "title": "What will commerce look like in Africa over the next decade?",
          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Boss Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in the United States, Godwin talked with a girl. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work. But if there\u2019s any challenge, it would be understanding the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the Nigerian market is not easy, and Nigerians relate differently with edtech startups. I think that\u2019s where most edtech people have it wrong, trying to replicate what people in America are using.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And according to the United Nations, September 23 every year is an opportunity to support and protect the linguistic identity and cultural diversity of all deaf people and other sign language users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) estimates that there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide and more than 80% of them are from developing countries.\n\nHow do people with hearing impairments communicate? Depending on the degree of severity, they use hearing aids, speech-to-text tools and sign languages to communicate.\n\nBefore yesterday, I thought there was just one universal sign language that every deaf person understood.\n\nHowever, studies show that there are over 300 sign languages in the world, and over 23 of them are used in Africa.\n\nInterestingly, technology is assisting people in Africa who have varying degrees of hearing loss.\n\nTo know how, please, read: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nOr watch the video: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nReelFruit raises $3 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s dried fruit snack brand, ReelFruit, has announced a $3 million Series A round to expand production, increase product offerings, and double down on exports to the US and other international markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlitheia IDF led the round with $2m. Samata Capital and Flying Doctor Healthcare Investment Company also participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Affiong Williams (CEO), ReelFruit is an agritech company that processes and distributes locally grown fruits. It claims to help communities by empowering fruit farmers by purchasing their raw materials.\n\nMore on its expansion plans, ReelFruit plans to build a new factory in Ogun State, Nigeria, to increase its monthly dried fruit production from 6 to 30 tonnes.\n\nIn its first year, the factory will employ over 200 people. With a larger supply of dried fruit, ReelFruit will develop new products for domestic and international markets.\n\nBy December 2021, the company plans to launch an eCommerce channel for direct US sales and open up more B2B opportunities, such as white-labelling and co-packing, to support the national drive toward import substitution.\n\nThe company believes local buyers will purchase dried fruit locally, reducing their reliance on imports.\n\nPaystack launches Apple Pay to help Nigerian businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack, an African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, announced yesterday that Pay with Apple Pay is now available on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean? Nigerian businesses will have access to millions of Apple Pay users across more than 60 countries where the payments service is available. And according to Paystack, it is the \u201cfastest, secure way for Nigerian businesses to accept international payments.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2014, Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s mobile payments and digital wallet service, allows users to pay securely and privately on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macbooks.\n\nHow will it work? When a customer with Apple Pay buys from a Paystack merchant, they will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay. They can then proceed to pay using Touch ID or Face ID.\n\nThey can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted commerce tools \u2014 Paystack Storefronts or Invoices \u2014 and through a variety of payment channels such as cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes, and EFT.\n\nIs this familiar?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges deaf people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play. Among other things, we can design sign language learning apps, inclusive audio/video with subtitling and automatic captioning. It can, and should, be done.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Projects worth N12trn abandoned across Nigeria",
          "text": "Rising security challenges in Nigeria, which have impacted all businesses, are taking a deadlier toll on the hospitality sector, especially in the northern part the country, with dwindling investment in the sector due to perceived unsafe business environment.\n\nThis correlates with recent findings by construction industry professionals that reveal that an estimated 56,000 construction projects valued at N12 trillion have been abandoned across Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones for various reasons.\n\nThese projects belong to private and public sector organizations, meaning that savings, bank credits and tax-payers money have been buried, leading to loss of jobs and income that affect so many people.\n\nBesides security concerns, most of the projects, according to Abba Tor, president, Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS), were abandoned due to poor research on the monetary estimates required for them. Hospitality sector, as a segment of the real estate market, is a major victim.\n\nDespite the boom in the hospitality sector, in the last two decades, no foreign branded hotel is located in Northern Nigeria except Abuja, which investors, who shun the other states in the region, perceive to be safe.\n\nAt present, the region\u2019s hospitality industry, according to hospitality experts, is losing over N10 billion annually to lack of quality investments in the sector, occasioned by the growing insecurity in the country, especially in the region.\n\nRead Also: PurpleLekki: New face of entertainment, hospitality industry on the way\n\nThat also is the reason for the near-zero investment in other real estate assets, especially residential and commercial properties. The region has seen significant destruction of homes by insurgents, more so in the crisis-ridden states like Borno and Kaduna.\n\nA report by the World Bank states that since commencement of the Boko Haram Scourge in 2009, about 956,453 (nearly 30%) out of 3,232,308 private houses; 5,335 classrooms and school buildings in 512 primary, 38 secondary and two tertiary institutions; 1,205 municipal, local government or ministry buildings; 76 police stations have been affected in Borno State.\n\nThough all these have, by default, created investment opportunities, investors are not investing, except some desperate ones who go about acquiring destroyed properties, or properties that are located in a crises area at cheaper prices for speculative purposes, according to Jambil Suyudi, an estate surveyor and valuer. \u201cBesides loss of homes, jobs that would have been created have also been lost,\u201d Suyudi said.\n\nBitrus Yakubu, a former commissioner in Plateau State and hotel investor, decries that Kano, the commercial and largest city in the region, including Kaduna and Jos, the once thriving tourism hubs in the region, all have capacity to attract over 10 branded hotels each, but have lost such opportunities to the growing insecurity in the region scaring away investors with huge capacity.\n\n\u201cIf you have a Sheraton brand in Kano, it will attract more of its kind. If you have 10 of such in a city, the taxes to the government is huge, employment and empowerment opportunities, especially for supplies will be huge. A foreign branded hotel in Abuja makes over N10 million a day, and if you multiply that for over 30 of such hotels across the other parts of the northern region where they are lacking, the region will be richer with over N10 billion annually\u201d, Yakubu said.\n\nExplaining the dynamics of the hospitality industry, Kunle Alatishe, a Dubai-based Accor Hotel Group sales executive, noted that huge investments attract bigger brands and the bigger the brand behind a hotel, the more the capacity and pricier the offerings are, hence guests are willing to pay $300 per night in a foreign branded boutique hotel in Abuja than N50,000 in the best hotel in Kano.\n\nThe former staff of Transcorp Hilton Abuja explained that foreign branded hotels come with quality offerings, service excellence and huge capacity that lure world-class travellers, foreigners, event planners and multinationals, which have capacity to pay for the hotel\u2019s appreciable pricing.\n\nHe regrets that lack of such investments has denied the region revenue from the hospitality value chain from taxes, supplies and deliveries, receipts from tours, purchase of local craft, and employment of locals, among other benefits.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, Accor Hotel Group was interested in expanding to Kaduna and Kano, considering the improvement on the airport, rail and other infrastructure, but the kidnapping, especially in Kaduna, made the key investor to pull out. His financial advisers warned him that it would be hard to sustain good return on his investment considering the escalating security challenge and that was how that project and many others died because of the insecurity,\u201d Alatishe said.\n\nCurrently, there are 12 foreign branded hotels in the North, with four in the pipeline and all are in Abuja, yet their least rooms are more expensive than the highest rooms in Fifth Chukka Resort Kaduna and Bristol Palace Hotel Kano, considered as the priciest hotels in the northern apart from Abuja.\n\nMaking a case for more investments in foreign brands, Emmanuel Ele, MD/CEO, Six Regions Hotels Limited, managers of Dominion Court Apartments & Rooms, Lagos, noted that with their huge capacity, pricey rates, and global networking, foreign brands pay better, train and often offer committed staff opportunity to join their global workforce amid many benefits.\n\nHowever, the indigenous hotels are not doing better in the region as insecurity has stifled their business in the last decade, while many who managed to stay afloat in the face of the security challenge are closing shop now because of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the worsening security situation.\n\nAccording to a report by Guest Frontline, a hospitality research outfit, indigenous hotels are growing five times more than foreign ones in Abuja, 10 times more in Lagos, seven times more in Port Harcourt and Owerri, while one third of such investments have closed in the northern region from 2009 till date due to poor patronage.\n\nAt present, only a few hotels are recording slightly above 20 percent occupancy rate in Maiduguri, 30 in Bauchi and 35 in Jos, while some have closed down due to dwindling profit that no longer sustain the business.\n\n\u201cBefore the crisis in 2009, an average room in Jos was around N10,000, it went down to N5000 at the wake of the crisis. It also improved with relative peace but always goes down at any crisis like we are experiencing now with the August 2021 killings\u201d, Shallom Buka, a hotel manager in Vom, Jos, said.\n\nSame applies to key towns in the region, from Jos, Kaduna, Maiduguri, Bauchi, Yola, Katsina to others, hotel rate crashes the moment crisis sets in as guests evacuate their rooms or leave town for safety.\n\nAs well, both local and foreign investors are now shifting to regions with relative peace and with assurance of good return on their investments.\n\nHospitality experts think that the trend of poor patronage, closing of hotels and shunning of investments in the region will continue as long as the security challenges are not addressed across the region.",

The e-Naira is built on a blockchain open ledger technology. Creating the e-Naira on the blockchain means you cannot have a duplicate or fake e-Naira. Each e-Naira note will be unique.\n\nEthiopian Airlines to begin flights to Enugu from October 1st\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest airline, Ethiopian Airlines has announced that it will resume flights to Enugu Airport from the 1st of October, two years after the east African giant suspended flights to the southeastern state of Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by Shimeles Arage, the airline\u2019s general manager, in Lagos on Sunday, stating that every week there would be a flight on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, with B787 Dreamliner, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOct. 1 is Nigeria\u2019s Independence Day and the flight to Enugu on that day will reinforce Ethiopian Airline\u2019s good relations with Nigeria since the first flight to Nigeria in 1960,\u201d Arage said.\n\nDigital transactions to be taxed technologically from the week ahead\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the use and deployment of technology to tax all digital transactions carried out across Nigeria in a bid to improve government earnings.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha at the 17th General Assembly and 10th anniversary of the West Africa Tax Administration Forum (WATAF) in Abuja on Tuesday, organised by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), reported by the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nThe SGF said the office of the Presidency ordered the FIRS to ensure digital transactions were taxed digitally, in a bid to achieve seamless digital collection and remittance of tax revenue accrued from the digital economy to improve revenue collection and remittance as a matter of government policy.\n\nChairman of FIRS, Mohammed Nami, said the importance of the role of WATAF could not be overemphasised because the reason it was set up by the founding fathers, was to create the atmosphere for dialogue on collaborative efforts, citing its theme for 2021, \u201cThe Taxation of the Digital Economy: Exploring Untapped Revenue Sources in Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cTax regulators and other industry stakeholders must rise up to the challenge of being in a position to tap into the stream of opportunity that advancements in science and technology afford us, \u201d he stated.\n\nIPOB set to protest in the week ahead of October 1st celebrations\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has declared another sit-at-home protest on October 1, which is the anniversary of Nigeria\u2019s independence, insisting that they would lock down the entire Southeast.\n\nThe separatist group also directed its members to bring down all Nigerian flags mounted anywhere throughout the South East, with effect from September 25, 2021.\n\nThis disclosure is contained in a statement issued by the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, and made available to the press in Awka, Anambra State on Saturday, September 25, 2021.\n\nThe reaction from IPOB follows information received by the group about an alleged plot by the Department of State Service (DSS) not to produce Kanu in court on October 21 as part of the ploy to continue to incarcerate him.\n\nGoogle grants users access to check advertizers campaign history\n\nGoogle will begin providing users with additional information about the companies that are sponsoring the ads they see. The \u201cAbout this ad\u201d tab will provide basic information about advertisers as well as any other advertisements they\u2019ve run in the last 30 days. Following complaints about frauds on the platform, the objective is to assist users to accurately determine if a certain ad buyer is trustworthy.\n\nAccording to the company, it has begun vetting advertisers in 90 countries, but the disclosure option will be available only in the United States in the coming months, with plans to extend to other nations in 2022.\n\nEvery day, more than 30 million people engage with Google ads\u2019 transparency and control menus, and the simplified experience of \u201cAbout this ad\u201d has garnered a good response. The company noted that users interact with their ad transparency and control features on YouTube more than on any other Google property. In the coming months, the company plans to extend the \u201cAbout this ad\u201d functionality to YouTube and \u2018Search\u2019 to help users make educated decisions online, regardless of where they engage.\n\nMojdeh Tomsich, product manager, Ads Privacy and Safety at Google said in a blog post: \u201cToday, people engage with a wider variety of ad formats on more Google products than ever before \u2014 from Video ads on YouTube to Shopping ads across Search, Display and more. And they increasingly want to know more about the ads they see. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been innovating on features like \u201cAbout this ad\u201d to help users understand why an ad was shown, and to mute ads or advertisers they aren\u2019t interested in.\n\nCrude oil prices trade at the highest levels since 2018, tending towards $80 a barrel\n\nOil prices steadied on Friday near a two-month high of $77.50 a barrel and was headed for a third straight week of gains, supported by global output disruptions and inventory draws.\n\nThe supply of crude oil in the United States dropped to its lowest level in almost three years last week, as hurricanes Ida and Nicholas caused lower inventories.\n\nOil prices dipped on Monday, extending upper week\u2019s losses after the U.S. dollar jumped to a three-week high and the U.S. rig count rose, although nearly a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico output stayed offline in the wake of two hurricanes.\n\nWith about 16 Percent of Crude Oil Production in the Gulf of Mexico Still Offline, U.S. oil refiners are hunting to replace crude lost to the Hurricanes. U.S. refiners are turning to Iraqi and Canadian oil, while their Asian buyers are pursuing the Middle Eastern and Russian grades.\n\nIn addition to declining output due to underinvestment or maintenance delays caused by COVID-19, some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies (OPEC+) have also been challenged to raise output.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to grow steadily supported by global output disruptions and inventory draws.\n\nNational Bureau of Statistics economy data release calendar for the week ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\n\u00b7 Monday 27th September 2021: Air Transportation Data (Half-year 2021)\n\nCurrency market\n\nOn a week-on-week basis, the Naira depreciated in value, at the I & E FX window, the domestic currency fell by -0.49% to N414.90/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.

Those who have formidable godfathers also flex their muscles.\n\nIn 1999, Chinwoke Mbadinuju, a legal practitioner, became the governor of Anambra State at the behest of Emeka Offor, an oil mogul.\n\nChris Ngige managed to preside over the state on the benevolence of the then enfant terrible and moneybags, Chris Ubah.\n\nUbah did not only have the cash, he also had all the right connections, and his tentacles stretched deep into the Presidential Villa during the Olusegun Obasanjo administration. Ngige had the brain as a medical doctor.\n\nPeter Obi did not also come to the Government House as a poor man. His net worth at that time conferred some air of confidence in him. He did not just stop the fight at the polling units; he brutally pursued and won a number of legal battles.\n\nThe incumbent Governor, Willie Obiano could be said to be Obi\u2019s \u201cman Friday\u201d and effortlessly rode to the power stool on Obi\u2019s crest. It would be uncharitable though to say Obiano contested the position as a pauper, because he had made some money having worked at the apex levels of some oil companies and banks before venturing into politics.\n\nToday, as the state prepares for an off-season gubernatorial election fixed for November 6, 2021, a galaxy of stars has appeared on the scene, jostling to succeed Obiano.\n\nWhile a few of them cannot be said to be moneybags on their own, they however, have eminent backers ready to bankroll their electoral expenses to the last kobo.\n\nA good number of them are private-sector players who have never, either worked for government or done any contract for government. They became whatever they are today by dint of hard work.\n\nFor some months now, Anambra has been in the news. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been going back and forth on the issues arising from the factional and acrimonious primaries of some parties in the race.\n\nSome lawyers have also used the opportunity of the confusion to profiteer from the process as they engage in \u201cforum shopping\u201d- taking cases to faraway places outside the jurisdiction where they originated. Some of the judges have also smiled to the bank as a result of entertaining such cases.\n\nINEC, until recently, had been thrown into confusion as to what to do with the ballot, as it continued to add and drop names of candidates in line with the variegated court pronouncements.\n\nIt does appear that the coast is now clear for the Commission to really do its job as those who are supposed to represent their parties are now cleared by the court and their parties.\n\nRead Also: Soludo, Ozigbo missing as INEC releases list of Anambra Guber candidates\n\nThe final list of candidates for the election will however, be published by INEC in October.\n\nOf the political parties, seven are prominent. They are the All Progressives Congress (APC) represented by Andy Uba; All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Chukwuma Soludo is the standard bearer.\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) is being represented by Valentine Ozigbo. The Accord Party (AP) has Godwin Maduka as its candidate.\n\nOthers are Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) with Obiora Okonkwo as the candidate; Youth Progressive Party (YPP) is represented by Ifeanyi Ubah, and Labour Party (LP) fielding Obiora Agbasimalo.\n\nAlthough all the candidates have since commenced skeletal campaign, BusinessDay gathered that the real electioneering will begin from Monday, September 27, 2021.\n\nGodwin Maduka\n\nGodwin Maduka was born in 1959 in Nkerehi, Orumba South Local Government Area. He is a Nigerian-American doctor, businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder of Las Vegas Pain Institute and Medical Centre. In 2008, he played a major role in the renaming of his hometown, from Nkerehi to Umuchukwu.\n\nHe started his education in Nawfia Comprehensive Secondary School and All Saints Grammar School, Umunze, before getting admission to study Medicine at the University of Port Harcourt, but couldn\u2019t join his peers due to lack of monetary support. He got an opportunity through his cousin Richard Igwike (who taught at Russ College at the time) to study at Rust College on a scholarship that covered half of his tuition. He later got monetary support from his younger brother and uncle and moved to the United States in 1982. In 1984, he graduated summa cum laude in chemistry from Rust College and got another scholarship to study pharmacy at Mercer University, graduating in 1988.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked as a pharmacy technician, before getting a full scholarship to study medicine at the University of Tennessee, where he completed an internship and graduated in 1993. He furthered to Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre for his post-graduate training and residency in anesthesiology, critical care, and pain management, graduating in 1997.\n\nIn 1997, after his education, Maduka moved to Las Vegas and got a job where he was paid $8,000 as an advance payment. He worked as an anesthesiologist at Desert Spring United Methodist Church, Nevada and other hospitals, before starting his own practice at Red Rock Medical Group, Nevada. In 1999, he founded Las Vegas Pain Institute and Medical Centre, before expanding to other six locations in Southern Nevada.\n\nHe is a clinical faculty supervisor and adjunct professor of pain management and anesthesiology at Touro University Nevada. He is also a clinical assistant professor of surgery at UNLV School of Medicine. While growing up, Maduka\u2019s mother was a farmer and merchant. His father was a traditional herbalist.\n\nToday, Maduka has touched many people with his philanthropic gestures. He has built houses for indigent members of society. He believes that what he has been able to do is enough to convince voters that he is the best man for the job.\n\nKen Emeakhayi, who recently joined Maduka\u2019s team, said: \u201cMany people are coming to you asking for your votes and promising they will develop your community when they become governor, but you need to go and check what they have been able to achieve for their own communities.\n\n\u201cMaduka is from a poor family, but made a pledge to God that he will bless the poor with his resources, and he has been doing that as a private individual. That is why he has developed his community.\n\n\u201cHis dream is to see that he helps a lot more people out of poverty, and the only way to do this is to get government machinery, by becoming governor.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Anambra guber: The battle of moneybags, intrigues and antics\n\nAndy Uba\n\nAndy Uba was born on December 14, 1958 in Enugu, and attended the Boys High School in Awkunanaw. His parents originated from Uga in the Aguata LGA of Anambra State.\n\nWhile still in the United States Uba assisted in the 1999 Presidential elections in Nigeria.\n\nFollowing the elections he returned to Nigeria and was appointed Special Assistant on Special Duties and Domestic Affairs to President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nIn 2007, Uba contested in the PDP primaries for the Anambra State governorship election, and was elected in the April 14, 2007 elections. However, the former governor Peter Obi challenged the election, saying that because the courts had only accepted that Obi had won the April 2003 elections on 15 March 2006, he still had three more years or his four-year term to serve. The courts accepted this argument and on June 14, 2007 nullified Andy Uba\u2019s election. In November 2009 it was reported that Uba was planning to run for the delayed Anambra State gubernatorial elections in February 2010 on the Labour Party platform, after the Labour Party had invited him to make the move. The party\u2019s leadership said they \u201cbelieved that he will deliver on the ideals and objectives of the party\u201d. In the February 2010 elections, Uba came in third.\n\nUba returned to the PDP and was nominated as PDP candidate for Anambra South Senatorial district in the April 2011 elections. He won with 63,316 votes, ahead of Chukwumaeze Nzeribe of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) with 43,798 and the Senator Ikechukwu Obiorah of the Accord Party with 24,724. Uba\u2019s election was challenged by Senator Obiora, the Accord candidate, who claimed that Uba had forged his West African School Certificate (WASC) and had not obtained any of the university degrees that he claimed.\n\nChukwuma Soludo\n\nCharles Chukwuma Soludo was born on July 28, 1960. He is a Nigerian economics professor and a former governor and chairman of the board of directors of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Chukwuma was named governor of CBN on May 29, 2004. He is also a member of the British Department for International Development\u2019s International Advisory Group.\n\nSoludo has been a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund, the University of Cambridge, the Brookings Institution, the University of Warwick, and the University of Oxford as well as a visiting professor at Swarthmore College (USA). He has also worked as a consultant for a number of international organisations, including The World Bank, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Programme. Soludo is a core professional in the business of macroeconomics. He obtained his three degrees and then professorship at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka, Enugu State. Soludo graduated with a First Class Honours degree in 1984, an MSc Economics in 1987, and a PhD in 1989, winning prizes for the best student at all three levels.\n\nChukwuma has been trained and involved in research, teaching, and auditing in such disciplines as multi-country macro-econometric modelling, techniques of computable general equilibrium modelling, survey methodology, and panel data econometrics, among others. He studied and taught these courses at many universities, including Oxford, Cambridge, and Warwick. Soludo has co-authored, co-edited, and authored a number of books on this subject matter.\n\nIn 1998, Soludo was appointed to the position of professor of economics at the University of Nigeria; the next year he became a visiting professor at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nSoludo joined the Federal Government in 2003. Prior to his May 2004 appointment to the bank chairmanship, he held the positions of Chief Economic Adviser to former President Obasanjo and Chief Executive of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria.\n\nOn September 16, 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Soludo as a member of a newly formed 8-member Economic Advisory Council (EAC) which would report directly to the President.\n\nIn September 2009, Soludo announced his aspiration for the seat of the Governor of Anambra State\u2019s election of February 9, 2010. On October 9, 2009, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) chose Soludo as their consensus candidate for the position from a field of 47 candidates, after repeated attempts to hold elective primaries were stalled by court injunctions. However, his nomination was contested by 23 of the 47 aspirants, citing lack of transparency in the process.\n\nAfter the initial rancour, 36 out of the 47 candidates, and several top shots of the PDP affirmed their support for Soludo on Wednesday, October 14, 2009. Soludo went on to lose to Peter Obi in an election which was largely considered free and fair according to major election observers. However, with his perceived solid performance as CBN governor, Soludo remains a respected economic policy authority in Nigeria. Political commentators, while urging an issue-based campaign in the 2011 election, had called on aspirants to work with respected economists like Soludo towards an acceptable economic plan.\n\nOn 17 July 2013, Soludo resigned from the People\u2019s Democratic Party after writing a letter to the National Chairman of the party, Bamanga Tukur. He later joined the All Progressives Grand Alliance in preparation for the November 2013 governorship race in Anambra State. In mid-August 2013, he, along with five other qualified aspirants, was disqualified by the APGA Screening Committee.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, unidentified gunmen disrupted an interactive session between Isuofia youths and Soludo at the town\u2019s civic centre, leading to the death of three police officers.\n\nIn February 2021, Soludo officially declared his intention to run for the position of Governor of Anambra State under the banner of APGA.\n\nValentine Ozigbo\n\nValentine Chineto \u201cVal\u201d Ozigbo was born July 20, 1970.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nI preferred EndPoliceBrutality to EndSARS for certain reasons. I knew from experience that almost all units and cadre of officers were abusers and felt that focusing on a section won\u2019t deal with the matter. Nevertheless, that struggle is needed as they are all officers. I also preferred a different approach to tackling Police Brutality to Protest Marches because of precedents. My priority was safety which I knew this government couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t provide. I can only willingly die for a country that values me and when I am sure that my death will yield desired change. In the absence of that, I do my best while ALIVE.\n\nI have witnessed too many incidents of police victimization that I had to teach myself restraint and patience. For rape survivors, I had to institutionalize escort services because the police can never be fully trusted to adhere to professional standards of operation. This poor work ethics of police officers is systemic issue and it is why it has become recurring subject.\n\nYes, we sometimes read the gory stories but in truth, Police Officers on a daily basis simply do not do their jobs. They just don\u2019t assimilate the fact that they are paid to do the job but rather exhibit a stupid ego of them doing citizens favours by showing up at their place of work. Trainings help a little but many of them jettison trainings because they know that their system is designed to cover their crimes. This fuels impunity and make them do and undo.\n\nFew days ago, I saw news about a young man killed by police officers in Benin-City. Yesterday night, I read report of the Soldier who assaulted an NYSC Corp member. This morning, I read about the murder of a young man by police officers in Uyo. There are many more \u2026\n\nI took time during the #EndSARS Protest to read reports of Police victimization. I also tried to follow up with stories that were presented in the various judicial panels of inquiry. Sadly and unfortunately, I still read similar reports till date The multi-hydra monster is still with us and we are yet to adequately strategize how to deal with it. It is good that we have identified this monster (Police Brutality), we however now know that it is actually \u2013 Law Enforcement Officers Brutality \u2013 as it is not limited to Police alone.\n\nWe can argue that ordinary citizens of this country are wicked to one another and use that as inference to the inhumane behaviour of our law enforcement officers. However, the officers OWE us more. These officers owe us respect, and professional discharge of duties. That uniform they wear should make them to be accountable as the uniform is symbolic. The Police is to protect lives and properties but our officers do opposite of their mandates.\n\nHow can a lawless officer enforce law?\n\nHow can an inhumane officer protect citizens?\n\nHow can irresponsible officers take responsibility for their actions and inactions?\n\nHow can corrupt officers be accountable?\n\nHow do we change a criminal justice system that institutionalize injustice and structurally promote impunity of criminal actions ?\n\nEquality brings Development which in turn brings PEACE.\n\n______________________\n\nPriscilla Usiobaifo is the Executive Director of BraveHeart Initiative (BHI), Igarra, Edo State.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has said his administration has trained over 11,365 teachers in the state since the introduction of Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EDOBEST) in 2018, deploying digital teaching tools to provide functional basic education to Edo children.\n\nObaseki said this at the 29th annual International Conference of the Association of Vocational Education of Nigeria (AVTEN), held at the University of Benin (UNIBEN).\n\nThe governor noted that his administration\u2019s sustained investment in basic education is hinged on its role at boosting technical and vocational training.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe basis for a solid technical and vocational education is quality basic education because without ensuring that our children have the right foundational skills, both literacy and life skills, they cannot grow independently.\n\n\u201cWithout that foundation, you cannot build a solid technical and vocational education. So, since 2018, we commenced the revamping of the state\u2019s basic education through our EDOBEST programme. We are proud of our achievements in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted: \u201cWe have renovated and constructed over 400 primary schools, improved teaching and learning in about 814 primary schools and trained 11,365 teachers, while over 246,731 children have benefited from our reforms in our basic education system.\n\n\u201cWe realize that if children are going to get quality education at a foundational stage, then you must focus on the teachers. Under EDOBEST, we have built the capacity of our teachers and our head teachers through the use of technology.\n\n\u201cWe made sure that learning materials were available to our children. Over the last three years, we have produced more than 8.5 millions textbooks and learning materials for these children. We have also built the capacity of our educational managers.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have also launched EDOBEST 2.0 because we have seen that in three to four years, we have moved children from primary one to six.\n\n\u201cWe have also realized that the junior school is where the child is defined. We want to make sure that they get vocational and technical skills. We have been able to train about 160,000 young men and women in various programmes through our skills development agency, EdoJobs.\n\n\u201cWe have enjoyed a lot of local and international partners including the Bank of Industry. One of the most recent projects which we are very excited about is the Edo technology skills campus. Under this arrangement, our goal is to make sure that over the next three to five years, we train a minimum of 10,000 people in software engineering in Edo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the establishment of a Federal Technical College of Education in South-South to train technical teachers, which is to be sited in Edo. By the grace of God, that school will take off by January next year,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigerian-British boxer, Anthony Joshua was on Saturday night, beaten by Oleksandr Usyk who put on a master class in the ring to collect Joshua\u2019s trio of heavyweight titles\n\nThe former undisputed cruiserweight champion, Usyk shook up the heavyweight division, and with tears in his eyes raised his arms in the center of the ring after the decision.\n\nUsyk (19-0, 13 KOs) set a hellacious pace from the jump to land the cleaner and heavier shots to outbox Anthony Joshua (24-2, 22 KOs) and relieve him of his WBO, WBA and IBF heavyweight titles. Despite no knockdowns, the fight was a thriller in front of nearly 68,000 fans at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium outside of London, CBS Sports reported.\n\n\u201cThis means much for me, a lot,\u201d Usyk said. \u201cThe fight went exactly the way I expected it to go. There were a couple of moments when Anthony pushed me hard but nothing special.\u201d\n\nThe 34-year-old Usyk threw a major wrench in the division\u2019s plans to crown the first undisputed champion of the four-belt era. Joshua, 31, was supposed to face WBC and lineal champion Tyson Fury this summer but plans were canceled after Deontay Wilder won a court injunction to invoke a trilogy bout against Fury for Oct. 9.\n\nInstead of setting up plans for an all-England summit for the undisputed title, the next development besides Wilder-Fury III will be whether Joshua accepts his own contractually obligated rematch against Usyk.\n\n\u201cI have been working so hard since January in preparation for this fight,\u201d Usyk said. \u201cIt took me some half a year and I didn\u2019t see my family for so long. I miss my children and I miss watching them play. I want to go home and be happy and I\u2019m not thinking about the rematch at this second.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough boxing and MMA? Get the latest in the world of combat sports from two of the best in the business. Subscribe to Morning Kombat with Luke Thomas and Brian Campbell for the best analysis and in-depth news, including instant analysis of Usyk\u2019s shocking victory over Joshua on Saturday night in London below.\n\nJoshua, who had a swollen right eye that was threatening to close late in the fight, did not speak in the aftermath as he sought medical care. But promoter Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport ultimately believes his fighter will seek a second bout.\n\n\u201cThe rematch is going to be tough but there is nowhere to hide,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cAJ is at the stage of his career where he wants his world championship and he\u2019s already talking about it now. The doctors are talking to him. To me, it looks like a damaged eye socket. He says he\u2019s fine but he told me he couldn\u2019t see from about the ninth round on.\u201d\n\nUsyk, who had both swelling below his right eye and a cut above it, was able to set a tone in the early rounds with hard and accurate left crosses that Joshua could be in trouble if he stood in front of him. Joshua was repeatedly backed up by left hands and his legs buckled a bit late in Round 3.\n\nYet Usyk stayed true to his game plan and never went for the finish.\n\n\u201cI had no objective to knock him out because my trainers pushed me not to do that,\u201d Usyk said. \u201cIn the beginning, I hit him hard but my corner said to just stop and do my job.\u201d\n\nIn just his third heavyweight fight and first since closely outpointing Dereck Chisora last fall, Usyk raised his game to a completely higher level against Joshua. He did so with constant feinting to disarm his opponent and turn him into a counterpuncher. Yet Usyk operated at close distance the whole time and relied on his defense and head movement to slide away from big shots.\n\nThe only question as the first half rolled on became whether Usyk could keep up the pace. To Joshua\u2019s credit, he rallied nicely in the middle rounds as Usyk slightly began to fade. Joshua took the sting off of his shots and merely touched Usyk with the jab. It opened up opportunities for Joshua to land big shots to the body to slow down Usyk\u2019s movement.\n\nYet on the night of his 12th wedding anniversary, the greatest trick Usyk pulled was never allowing Joshua to build upon any momentum by coming out the next round and simply being busier. With the fight possibly up for grabs entering the final round, Usyk backed Joshua up from the start and battered him against the ropes late to remove any doubt.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see the best Usyk, I can be much better,\u201d Usyk said.\n\nUsyk joined Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko as the only Ukrainian-born heavyweight champions. Joshua, meanwhile, suffered just his second pro defeat following an upset TKO loss to Andy Ruiz Jr. In 2019 that he avenged later in the year.\n\n\u201cWe talked about overthinking it and getting too technical,\u201d Hearn said. \u201cHe tried to do that with arguably one of the pound-for-pound top fighters in the world. Tonight, Usyk was fantastic. I don\u2019t think this was a great performance from AJ when he looks back but was that the brilliance of Oleksandr Usyk? Joshua looked tired as the fight went on and he looked tired a little bit. Was that the mental fatigue of Usyk\u2019s work?\n\n\u201cUsyk was busier than I expected him to be. I thought he had the perfect game plan and tonight he makes history as the unified heavyweight world champion. You have to take your hat off to him. This is sport and the better man won.\u201d\n\nUsyk outlanded Joshua by a margin of 148 to 123, according to CompuBox.\n\nElsewhere on the undercard, Lawrence Okolie continued his dominant run at cruiserweight with a third-round TKO of Dilan Prasovic. The WBO champion, who is just 28 years old, made quick work of Prasovic, who was in his first real step-up bout to date as a previously unbeaten fighter. Plus, former WBA super middleweight champion Callum Smith made a thunderous debut at light heavyweight with an electric knockout of Lenin Castillo. Smith finished off Castillo in the second round with a devastating punch that left Castillo seizing on the ground. He was stretchered out of the ring in a scary scene.\n\nCBS Sports was with you throughout the entire way on Saturday, so. be sure to follow along with the live results and highlights below.\n\nFight card, results\n\nOleksandr Usyk def.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has justified President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s borrowings, insisting that the various loans including the foreign debt that it is taking are not for funding recurrent expenditures or pay salaries, but for implementing capital projects which the previous administrations failed to execute.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, made the claim in Maiduguri, Borno State, during a one-day town hall meeting on the power situation in the state, amid criticisms against the government\u2019s constant resort to borrowing.\n\nFormer president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, had, for instance, berated the Buhari government last week over its accumulation of debt, with the country\u2019s debt profile now in excess of N35trn, saying that it irresponsible to borrow to fund recurrent expenditure and to accumulate debt for future generation.\n\nThe criticisms came particularly in the light of last week\u2019s request by Buhari for another external loan to the Senate.\n\nIn his letter transmitted to the Senate, he sought the approval of the lawmakers to borrow $4 billion and \u20ac710 million loans from bilateral and multilateral organisations to fund the deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe National Assembly had earlier in July approved the President\u2019s request to borrow $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nHowever, while defending the frequent request for loans, Mohammed said that the federal government has implemented a lot of projects in different parts of the country which he claimed the previous administrations had used as a conduit pipe to squander public funds.\n\nHe said the critics were members of previous administrations who performed badly in terms of modernising the country\u2019s infrastructure, even when they served at a time when earnings were multiples of what is obtainable today.\n\nThe minister pointed out that infrastructure is the engine of economic growth, hence, the premium it places on building and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cNaysayers have recently ramped up their criticism of the Buhari administration from borrowing. These critics are very insincere; we do not borrow for recurrent expenditure neither do we borrow to pay salaries. We are borrowing to build world-class infrastructures that will benefit generations of Nigerians and we have a lot to show from the loans we have taken,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister noted that the Federal Government has over 13,000 kilometres of federal roads under repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a road project in every state today. Today we have started the countdown to when the second Niger bridge which successive administrations have built only on paper will be completed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is an irony that those who are criticizing us today performed very badly in terms of modernizing our infrastructure even when they served at a time when our earnings were multiples of what we get today. Have they embarked on the kind of infrastructure development we are currently engaged in perhaps there would have been no reason for us to borrow as much as we are doing today.\n\n\u201cFor example, in their time they claimed to have spent billions of naira in building infrastructure but as one can see their infrastructure projects are only on the pages of newspapers. Today we are still saddled with looking for resources to build the same infrastructure for which they claimed to have allocated huge resources. We\u2019ll however not be deterred by their antics, we\u2019ll continue to ignore those who have decided to play politics with everything,\u201d Mohammed added.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has been given a 14-day ultimatum to publish the names of those indicted in the misappropriation of over N6 trillion in Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThe looting occurred between 2000 and 2019, as documented in the recent Forensic Audit Report on NDDC.\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) gave the ultimatum, threatening legal action to force the disclosure of the looters.\n\nThe group asked Buhari to direct the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr Abubakar Malami to publish the looters\u2019 list.\n\nSERAP also urged Buhari \u201cto direct Mr Malami and appropriate anti-corruption agencies to promptly bring to justice anyone suspected to be responsible for the missing N6 trillion, and to fully recover any misappropriated public funds.\u201d\n\nIn the open letter dated 25 September 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cIt is in the public interest to promptly publish the names of those indicted in the audit report, and to ensure that they face prosecution, as appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking these decisive steps would advance the victims\u2019 right to restitution, compensation and guarantee of non-repetition, as well as improve public confidence in the fight against corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing the audit report to genuinely combat the corruption epidemic in the NDDC and rein in those indicted would alleviate poverty, improve access of Nigerians to basic public goods and services, and enhance the ability of your government to meet its human rights and anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cDespite the country\u2019s enormous oil wealth, ordinary Nigerians have derived very little benefit from trillions of naira budgeted for socio-economic development in the region primarily because of widespread grand corruption, and the entrenched culture of impunity of perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe level of grand corruption in the NDDC, and the devastating effects on poor Nigerians are serious enough to meet the requirements of crimes against humanity under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public interest in publishing the names of those indicted by the audit report outweighs any considerations to withhold the information, as there would be no prejudice against those whose names are published as long as the information is appropriately framed and truthful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe audit report raises prima facie evidence of grand corruption and its staggering effects in the Niger Delta. Nigerians have the right to know the names of those indicted and other details in the report, as guaranteed under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the Freedom of Information Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublishing widely the report and the names of those indicted would remove the possibility of obstruction of justice, and provide insights relevant to the public debate on the ongoing efforts to combat grand corruption and the longstanding impunity of perpetrators in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians are entitled to the right to receive information without any interference or distortion, and the enjoyment of this right should be based on the principle of maximum disclosure, and a presumption that all information is accessible subject only to a narrow system of exceptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to public interest test, even if the government demonstrates that the publication of the names of public officials would substantially harm a legitimate interest, it is nevertheless obliged to disclose the requested information if, as it is the case here, the public interest in disclosure is sufficient enough to overweigh any perceived harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, the Incorporated Trustees of SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisappropriation of public funds meant to ensure access to basic public goods and services rises to the level of crimes against humanity, as this has forced millions of Nigerians in the region to live in inhumane or degrading conditions, in violation of the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, the Forensic Audit Report into the activities of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) reveals grim allegations of misappropriation of N6 trillion in the commission between 2000 and 2019, and that there are over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the report, the NDDC operated a total of 362 bank accounts, which resulted in a \u2018lack of proper reconciliation of accounts.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe missing N6 trillion and over 13,000 abandoned projects in the Niger Delta have continued to have a negative impact on the human rights of Nigerians, undermining their access to basic public goods and services, such as education, healthcare, and regular and uninterrupted electricity supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic schools have been left to crumble and wither away, and health care facilities in several parts of the region lack even the most basic of amenities.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 15 subsection (5) of the Constitution requires your government to abolish all corrupt practices and abuse of power. The UN Convention against Corruption requires your government to ensure effective prosecution of allegations of corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpecifically, article 26 of the convention requires your government to ensure \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions\u201d including criminal and non-criminal sanctions, in cases of grand corruption. Article 26 complements the more general requirement of article 30, paragraph 1, that sanctions must take into account the gravity of the corruption allegations.\u201d\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr Malami; Professor Bolaji Owasanoye SAN, Chairman Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC); Abdulrasheed Bawa, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).",

          "text": "As the 2023 elections approach, Mrs Aisha Buhari, the President\u2019s wife, has perfected a plot to install her younger brother, Mr Mohammed Halilu Modi, as the next Governor of Adamawa State, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nNEWS DIRECT learnt that the First Lady\u2019s machination which has torn the Adamawa chapter of the All Progressives Congress apart enjoys the full support of the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Malam Mai Mala Buni, who is also the Yobe State Governor.\n\nThe former Vice-Chairman, North-East Zone, Comrade Mustapha Salihu, and the Financial Secretary of the party, Mr Saidu Naira, were identified as the foot soldiers manipulating the congresses in Adamawa State to facilitate the emergence of the First Lady\u2019s brother as the governorship candidate of the APC in the state.\n\nA source noted that the First Lady\u2019s brother has not held any known public office, neither has he worked as a civil servant his entire life.\n\nAs it was told that as part of the preparation to ensure that her brother was tutored for the job of a governor, Aisha recently sent Modi to the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, near Jos, Plateau State, to study, while the President\u2019s wife perfected the taking over of the APC\u2019s structure in Adamawa.\n\nThere are concerns that the first lady\u2019s desperation to assume full control of the party\u2019s structure in Adamawa State is not going down well with aggrieved stakeholders.\n\nAt the just-concluded Local Government Congresses of the APC in the state, the First Lady used her influence to intimidate perceived political opponents of her brother such as Senator Dahiru Binani, Senator Mohammed Jibrilla Bindow (former Governor of the state) and Senator Ishaku Abbo (who represents Adamawa North Senatorial zone) in the Senate to hijack the party structure in the state.\n\nA source conversant with the development, explained further, \u201cThere is a serious problem brewing at the Adamawa APC, which if not resolved quickly, may cost the party the seat of governor again like it did in 2019.\n\n\u201cRecall that in 2019, the party lost the governorship contest to the incumbent and member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Ahmadu Fintiri, over this same power tussle between Mrs Buhari, Bindow, Binani and other opponents in the quest to make her brother become the governor.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, security chiefs in the state were threatened with sack if they did not cooperate by facilitating Modi\u2019s aspiration.\u201d\n\nIt was also revealed that the first casualty of the threat was the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Aliyu Adamu Alhaji, who was said to have insisted on fully supervising the congresses in Yola South.\n\nAs a result, the First Lady\u2019s candidate lost to Senator Binani\u2019s candidate.\n\nAisha, who was enraged over the turn of events, was said to have immediately seen to the transfer of the CP out of Adamawa.\n\nHe had since been replaced by a new CP, Mr Mohammed Ahmed Barde.\n\n\u201cAs things stand today, all the heads of federal agencies in the state, whose line of duty relate to supervising party congresses, are living in fear of the unknown, should they attempt to work against the interest of the First Lady\u2019s brother\u201d, another party official said.\n\nSources further revealed that most of the names from the ward and local government congresses sent to the national secretariat of the APC were altered by the quartet in Abuja, which led to aeries of litigations challenging the alterations.\n\nAisha, who is not hiding the fact of her deep involvement in the ongoing manipulation, was quoted to have said, \u201cI will not repeat the mistake of 2019 where we allowed Governor Bindow to have total control of the party to the disadvantage of many of us.\u201d\n\nSources said Aisha had vowed that she could not afford to leave office with her husband in 2023 without any of her family members taking over Adamawa State in a bid to sustain their political relevance in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cExcept something is done urgently to amicably resolve the grievances from the ward and local government congresses, especially that the state congress is close by, many stakeholders may defect to the PDP.\n\n\u201cIf this is allowed to happen, it is the APC that will be the big loser again in 2023, just like it happened in 2019. The way they are going, they can only help the PDP and governor Fintiri to win re-election in 2023\u201d, a top party official stated.\n\nIncidentally, the current manipulation in Adamawa is going on at a time the general feeling in the state is that the governorship seat should rotate to another zone outside Adamawa Central in order to engender fairness and give a sense of belonging to all the geopolitical zones in the former Gongola State.\n\nAlthough the First Lady is rooting that the Central Zone has yet to produce a governor and believes it is the turn of the zone to do so in 2023, APC stakeholders are opposing her position on the grounds that her zone produced the post of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation since 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the fact that Aisha being the First Lady of the Federation and coming from the Central Zone as well, the zone has had its own fair share of the power equation and should hands off the governorship seat for another zone in 2023,\u201d the source added.\n\nSimilarly, the Northern Senatorial Zone had produced a governor for a record six times and the feeling is that the zone had benefitted adequately.\n\n\u201cSuch fairness can never be achieved if the congresses are manipulated against the wishes and aspirations of the people\u201d, another party source added.\n\n\u201cNow, during the local government congresses, this was what happened. While the election of party officials of Yola-South, the home local government of Sen. Binani and Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, was held at the state secretariat of the party in Jimeta amid heavy security operatives as against the Yola South party secretariat, Sen. Bindow and Sen Abbo did not even know where the congresses of Mubi North and Mubi South, their home local governments, took place till date.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson of the First Lady, Aliyu Abdullahi, who said he is in New York, declined comment when contacted on the phone, he simply said \u201cPlease I have nothing to comment on that story.\u201d",

          "text": "Oleksandr Usyk is the new unified heavyweight world champion after dethroning Anthony Joshua with an incredible performance in London.\n\nThe Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 65,000 fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, outclassing Joshua over 12 rounds, and hurting the defending champion on numerous occasions.\n\nThe scorecards \u2013 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 \u2013 were all for Usyk and there was a mere shrug of the shoulders from Joshua as the second defeat of his professional career was confirmed.\n\nHaving seen a fight with fellow Briton Tyson Fury collapse last summer, Joshua opted to face his WBO mandatory challenger and former undisputed cruiserweight champion Usyk instead.\n\nIt appeared the easier fight for Joshua, but boxing\u2019s triumphant return to stadium nights was soured for the home crowd by a truly exceptional performance from the challenger.\n\nUsyk pure class against one-gear Joshua\n\nJoshua was relaxed and cheerful as he approached the ring, but concentration was etched on his face from the first bell.\n\nUsyk\u2019s abilities quickly became apparent, the 34-year-old full of feints and pace from the off, moving Joshua around the ring at will as the defending champion settled into a surprisingly passive role.\n\nA few warning shots from Joshua fell short in the early rounds, Usyk either catching them with a glove or spinning away. It would become the pattern of the fight as Usyk made Joshua miss and executed a perfect gameplan of his own.\n\nA left cross from Usyk rattled Joshua in the third round, and prompted a noisy response from the crowd.\n\nJoshua rode the danger, failing to respond, but making it to the bell safely. Usyk was now brimming with confidence and the London crowd tried in vain to rouse their man into life.\n\nA low shot from Joshua brought a complaint from Usyk and Joshua fired off another, perhaps sensing a weakness in his opponent. Round five was Joshua\u2019s best to that point, but Usyk remained in control and the Briton continued to miss his attempts to land any meaningful shots.\n\nFinally, in the sixth round, Joshua landed his right hand, sparking a response form Usyk, who widened his stance and appeared ready to trade. Joshua backed off, wary of a firefight.\n\nAnd Joshua\u2019s fears were realised in the seventh as Usyk responded brilliantly to stun him with a left hook to the chin and send him stumbling backwards. Joshua stayed on his feet, surviving the round but now in a dire predicament.\n\nUsyk was comfortably ahead on the scorecards and Joshua struggled to close the gap. The huge weight advantage was nowhere in evidence, with Usyk keeping the fight at range and urgings from Joshua\u2019s corner to move forward appearing to fall on deaf ears.\n\nJoshua had Usyk briefly on the ropes in the ninth but returned to his corner with a bloody nose having caught a hard shot to the face in the closing seconds of the round.\n\nThere was blood on the faces of both men in the 11th round. Joshua had a cut and swelling on his eye; Usyk had a gash on his left eye. But while Usyk\u2019s mouth was open, he was by far the busier fighter in the penultimate round, outclassing Joshua with ease once again.\n\nThe crowd desperately tried to inspire the defending champion, who needed a knockout in the final round. But it was the challenger who almost found the decisive punch, pushing a dazed Joshua on to the ropes.\n\nThe bell saved Joshua from suffering another knockout defeat and there was a nervous wait for Usyk\u2019s team for the scorecards.\n\nThere were to be no more shocks, however, as all three judges gave it to the challenger and ended Joshua\u2019s short second reign as world champion after just one fight.\n\nJoshua left at a crossroads\n\nIt is unclear where Joshua goes from here. There is a rematch clause, one that the two-time world champion is likely to exercise.\n\nHe now has two losses to his name and on both occasions the Briton was dominated by a smaller man. Usyk did not find the knockout punch, but he exposed Joshua\u2019s frailties and somewhat light attacking arsenal.\n\nJoshua had no answer to Usyk and while his opponent glided across the ring, the champion appeared to be dragging his feet through mud. There was no attempt to bully Usyk, wear him down or go to the body.\n\nIt was a strange, almost hapless display from Joshua which leaves his legacy as one of the heavyweight greats in ruins.\n\nAside from the Briton\u2019s long-term career prospects, Joshua versus Fury now appears to be dead.\n\nFury fights Deontay Wilder next month in Las Vegas and every fight fan\u2019s greatest fear has been realised after the unification bout collapsed last summer.\n\nTo begin with, Joshua will have to win his rematch with Usyk which, after Saturday night\u2019s meeting, appears a near impossible prospect.",

He was a journalist, entrepreneur and sports administrator.

Yakubu Pam noted unless politicians realise the importance of connecting to God, the country will continue to drift to the precipice.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cThe increase of His Peace\u201d the NCPC boss who was the guest preacher at the second edition of the Chaplains\u2019 Conference said, \u201cin Nigeria and the world over there seems to be crises rocking the nations and even in the church and the family due to the absence of Peace\u201d\n\nReading from the books of Isaiah 9:7-10; Mark 4:35-38 and Psalms 23:1-5, he noted that Christ\u2019s Government was established on Peace that lives for all eternity.\n\nHe said Jesus is still on the throne and until politicians recognize He\u2019s on the throne Nigeria shall continue to live in confusion, insisting on the need to be steadfast in Christian lives to avoid confusion.\n\nAccording to Rev Pam, Peace is not attained through the acquisition of material things but inner Peace.\n\n\u201cSometimes it is not easy to remember that peace can not just be earned by other things we think can give peace.\n\n\u201cSo many times as human beings, we believe that Peace can come through material things. It is not so because I have witnessed in the past that big rich people do commit suicide.\n\n\u201cWhen you see people walking and dressing well you think they don\u2019t have problems, they do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NCPC boss said those who run from one pole to the other easily forget their solutions are closer to them tend to always live in confusion.\n\n\u201cWe have the power to fix our problems as a country and we don\u2019t need to look for the solutions elsewhere as Jesus is greater than the problem of the world.\n\n\u201cThe noise we make every time on social media is like trial and error.Jesus withdrew from the noise of the crowd so He can have the power to rebuke the storm.\n\nPam hinted that Nigeria and Plateau state must move forward no matter the great noise making the rounds on social media and other quarters.\n\nAccording to him. \u201cinner peace is greater than the noise on social media\u201d.\n\nHe called on the Chaplains to be focused and believe the conference will be a turning point for the nation and their various states.\n\nHe urged them to take their responsibilities seriously and ensure they intercede daily for their state governors, the President and, the nation at large.\n\n\u201cThe meeting today will turn Nigeria into a miracle. Our politicians should link up with God as power comes from God not, from the east or the west.\n\n\u201cThe trouble we are having now is all about the 2023 elections. If politicians can be patient, we will all achieve our dreams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that our politicians forget about death. Let them connect with God,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe further said \u201cOur success as a nation can only be achieved through prayers as God still answers prayers till today insisting that what you have is what determines how God answers you.\n\n\u201cNigeria will still move on no matter the raging storm only if we remain \u201d Still and Calm.\u201d",

          "text": "The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly, claiming Boko Haram terrorists were emboldened under his watch.\n\nIn a statement, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, said the caucus had extensively reviewed the President\u2019s address at the 76th session of the UNGA, noting that it is in \u201ccomplete disagreement with the ugly reality of the failures of his administration, as well as the economic, security and social ruins that have confronted the nation under his watch\u201d.\n\nElumelu said the caucus was \u201calarmed by President Buhari\u2019s report to UNGA that terrorists have been so weakened in Nigeria that they are now preying on soft targets, when in reality, insurgents have become so emboldened under his watch\u201d.\n\nAccording to the statement issued on Saturday, the insurgents are now attacking military formations, kidnapping and killing the nation\u2019s gallant officers while overrunning communities and murdering our citizens without restraint.\n\nAs representatives of the people, the Minority caucus expressed regret that President Buhari\u2019s speech did not reflect on the kidnapping and killing of students in Nigeria.\n\nThe opposition lawmakers argue that Buhari did not reflect the closure of schools and crippling of education in some parts of the country, where normal life has been destroyed by terrorists, neither did it show any empathy towards the victims of terrorism attacks.\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari Addresses World Leaders At UN General Assembly\n\n\u2018No Personal Commitment\u2019\n\n\u201cOur caucus is worried that in reflecting on violent conflicts, Mr. President\u2019s address conveyed no personal commitments that can guarantee an end to poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities, that are prevalent under his watch, even after identifying such as the causes of conflicts,\u201d Elumelu said.\n\n\u201cAlso, the minority caucus is shocked by the claims in Mr. President\u2019s speech that his administration \u201cbuilt\u201d isolation centers and emergency hospital wards, \u2018all over the country\u2019 \u2018in record time\u2019 in the fight against COVID-19; a claim that is in conflict with the infrastructural reality in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, our caucus is worried that Mr. President\u2019s speech did not portray any decisive road map towards economic recovery and food security; had no personal commitment to end corruption in his administration; had no personal commitment to end borrowing or show a clear-cut plan to repay the huge debt being accumulated by his administration.\u201d\n\nOn the 2023 general elections in the country, the opposition accused the President of lacking what it described as the definite personal commitments towards credible electoral process.\n\nThe Minority caucus therefore asked President Buhari to always cross check the content given to him by his handlers so as to ensure that his position, especially on the world stage, captures the reality as well as aspiration prevalent in the country.\n\nThis to them, is because such addresses ought to serve as an unblemished working document for interventions and solutions at various levels of governance.",

          "text": "Oleksandr Usyk ended Anthony Joshua\u2019s reign as world heavyweight champion in front of the Londoner\u2019s home crowd with a stunning unanimous points decision victory on Saturday, scuppering hopes of a \u2018Battle of Britain\u2019 unification bout with fellow world title-holder Tyson Fury.\n\nJoshua ended the 12th and final round of the contest backed up on the ropes, with the cheers of a crowd of more than 66,000 at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium no match for the skills of his challenger.\n\nThe impressive Ukrainian triumphed 117-112, 116-112 and 115-113 on the scorecards of the three judges in just the former undisputed cruiserweight world champion\u2019s third bout as a heavyweight.\n\nHis victory, which extended Usyk\u2019s perfect record as a professional to 19 wins from as many fights, saw him become just the third boxer after Evander Holyfield of the United States and Britain\u2019s David Haye to win both the cruiserweight and heavyweight world titles.\n\nBoxing fans have long looked forward to a clash between Joshua and British compatriot Fury, who defends his World Boxing Council heavyweight title against Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas next month \u2014 the third time the pair have fought each other following a split-decision draw and a win for Fury.\n\nBut Joshua had to get past Usyk, the 2012 Olympic heavyweight champion at the London Games where Joshua won the super-heavyweight gold medal.\n\n\u201cThis means a lot for me. The fight went the way I expected it to go. There were moments when Anthony pushed me hard but it was nothing special,\u201d said Usyk, who now follows brothers Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko in becoming a Ukrainian world heavyweight champion, via a translator.\n\n\u201cI had no objective to knock him out because my corner pushed me not to do that. In the beginning, I tried to hit him hard, but then I stuck to my job.\u201d\n\nThere is a rematch clause, with Joshua \u2014 who has now won 24 and lost two of his professional bouts \u2014 having previously lost his belts when beaten by Andy Ruiz in New York in June 2019 only to regain the titles in a rematch in Saudi Arabia six months later.\n\nEddie Hearn, Joshua\u2019s promoter, told Sky: \u201cI have spoken to him (Joshua) and it was a tough fight. He is devastated.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Oleksandr Usyk\u2026 He put in a great performance and the better man won.\n\n\u201c(Joshua) never really got going, he will go to hospital now, I don\u2019t know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn\u2019t look great.\u201d\n\nBut Hearn added: \u201cThe fighter in AJ is already talking about winning the rematch.\u201d\n\nJoshua later tweeted, writing: \u201cKeep positive even if the world\u2019s crumbling in front of you! London, I love you & thank you each and every time!\u201d\n\nAnd despite defeat, he was backed to bounce back by Lennox Lewis, a former three-time world heavyweight champion.\n\nREAD ALSO: Fury-Wilder Reach Tentative Agreement For Third Fight: Report\n\n\u2018Learn from This\u2019\n\n\u201cGotta give it up to @usykaa on a great tactical performance tonight. For @anthonyjoshua it\u2019s not the end of the road, but u can\u2019t be so tentative or wait till the 8th round to turn it on. Learn from this and improve,\u201d Lewis tweeted.\n\nAt 34, Usyk is three years older than Joshua and he was also giving away three inches in height as well as nearly 20lbs (nine kilogrammes) in weight.\n\nJoshua appeared relaxed during a protracted ring walk that saw him shaking hands with fans.\n\nBut Usyk moved well right from the opening bell and the southpaw staggered Joshua with a powerful left-hand punch to the head in the third round.\n\nUsyk\u2019s left hand continued to prove potent throughout a contest where a slimmed down Joshua did not appear to gain much resulting benefit in ring speed while at the same time lacking power in his punches.\n\nBy the end of the tenth round, there was swelling under Joshua\u2019s right eye.\n\nUsyk backed Joshua onto the ropes late on and appeared poised for a knockout when the final bell sounded.\n\nAFP",

Our governor, Willie Obiano, has performed creditably and the incoming governor (in his view), Chukwuma Soludo, will perform superlatively.\n\n\u201cThere is no political party in Nigeria that has the capacity to turn around the lives of the people as much as APGA has done.\u201d\n\nOye also took a swipe at the two frontline political parties in the country \u2013 All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying, \u201cVery soon, both of them will go into an irreversible coma, and APGA will become the ultimate undertakers.\u201d\n\n\u2018Who Can Battle With The Lord?\u2019\n\nIn her remarks, Mrs Obiano who had a majority of her speech delivered in Igbo canvassed support for the party.\n\nAccording to her, it is important for the people to vote for the party\u2019s candidate in the coming election in order to continue to enjoy the dividends of democracy in the state.\n\nThereafter, Soludo was presented the party\u2019s flag \u2013 symbolising his status as the party\u2019s candidate \u2013 by Governor Obiano and Mr Oye.\n\nHe began his acceptance speech with a song titled \u2018Who Can Battle With The Lord?\u2019 after which he thanked the party leaders and members for their support all through the events that led to his emergence as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\n\u201cWith a deep sense of humility and gratitude to Almighty, gratitude to our lovely party that gave me the opportunity to be able to fly this flag, we accept to fly this flag,\u201d the party\u2019s candidate said. \u201cBy the special grace of God, the will and wish of the people have been expressed.\n\n\u201cThere are 32 support and self-funding groups with a membership of over 500,000 across Anambra, Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu, everywhere, that have worked tirelessly for over two years.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that should happen in Anambra will be to consolidate the wonderful works that are ongoing, especially under the 16 years of APGA in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obiano, in his remarks, explained why he believes his party will win again in the forthcoming election.\n\n\u201cIn the last 15 and half years, we have delivered the dividend of democracy to Anambra residents, and particularly in the last seven and half years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why our candidate will win, and win landslide.\n\n\u201cSo many things have been said about my achievements which most of you know but let me show some examples. The international cargo and passenger airport in Anambra that I built in 15 months, the runway is the second-longest in Nigeria. It has the tallest tower in Nigeria and the most modern terminal building, and I built this airport without borrowing a kobo.\u201d",

          "text": "At least three people were killed Saturday afternoon when an Amtrak train that runs between Seattle and Chicago derailed in north-central Montana, toppling several cars onto their sides, authorities said.\n\nThe westbound Empire Builder train derailed about 4 p.m. near Joplin, a town of about 200, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said in a statement. The accident scene is about 150 miles (241 kilometers) northeast of Helena and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the border with Canada.\n\nLiberty County sheriff\u2019s dispatcher Starr Tyler told The Associated Press that three people died in the derailment. She did not have more details. Amtrak said in a statement that there were multiple injuries.\n\nThe train had about 141 passengers and 16 crew members onboard, Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams said. The train had two locomotives and 10 cars, eight of which derailed, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn local authorities are now confirming that three people have lost their lives as a result of this accident,\u201d Abrams said.\n\nMegan Vandervest, a passenger who was going to visit a friend in Seattle, told The New York Times that she was awakened by the derailment.\n\n\u201cMy first thought was that we were derailing because, to be honest, I have anxiety and I had heard stories about trains derailing,\u201d said Vandervest, who is from Minneapolis. \u201cMy second thought was that\u2019s crazy. We wouldn\u2019t be derailing. Like, that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nShe told the Times that the car behind hers was tilted, the one behind that was tipped over, and the three cars behind that \u201chad completely fallen off the tracks and were detached from the train.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from the Liberty County Senior Center, where some passengers were being taken, Vandervest said it felt like \u201cextreme turbulence on a plane.\u201d\n\nResidents of communities near the crash site quickly mobilized to help the passengers.\n\nChester Councilwoman Rachel Ghekiere said she and others helped about 50 to 60 passengers who were brought to a local school.\n\n\u201cI went to the school and assisted with water, food, wiping dirt off faces,\u201d she said. \u201cThey appeared to be tired, shaken but happy that they were where they were. Some looked more disheveled than others, depending where they were on the train.\u201d\n\nA grocery store in Chester, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the derailment, and a nearby religious community provided food, she said.\n\nThe passengers were taken by buses to hotels in nearby Shelby, said Ghekiere, whose husband works for the local emergency services agency and was alerted to the crash.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board will send a 14-member team, including investigators and specialists in railroad signals and other disciplines, to investigate the crash, spokesman Eric Weiss said.\n\nWeiss said the derailment occurred around 3:55 p.m. and no other trains or equipment were involved. The train was traveling on a BNSF Railway main track at the time, he said.\n\nPhotos posted to social media showed rail cars on their sides and passengers standing alongside the tracks, some carrying luggage. The images showed sunny skies, and it appeared the accident occurred along a straight section of tracks.\n\nAmtrak said that because of the derailment, the Sunday westbound Empire Builder will terminate in Minneapolis, and the Sunday eastbound Empire Builder train will originate in Minneapolis.\n\nOther recent Amtrak derailments include:\n\n\u2014 April 3, 2016: Two maintenance workers were struck and killed by an Amtrak train going more than 100 mph in Chester, Pennsylvania. The lead engine of the train derailed.\n\n\u2014 March 14, 2016: An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago derailed in southwest Kansas, sending five cars off the tracks and injuring at least 32 people. Investigators concluded that a cattle feed delivery truck hit the track and shifted it at least a foot before the derailment.\n\n\u2014 Oct. 5, 2015: A passenger train headed from Vermont to Washington, D.C., derailed when it hit rocks that had fallen onto the track from a ledge. The locomotive and a passenger car spilled down an embankment, derailing three other cars and injuring seven people.\n\n\u2014 May 12, 2015: Amtrak Train 188 was traveling at twice the 50 mph speed limit as it entered a sharp curve in Philadelphia and derailed. Eight people were killed and more than 200 were injured when the locomotive and four of the train\u2019s seven passenger cars jumped the tracks. Several cars overturned and ripped apart.",

          "title": "Usyk Stuns Joshua By Unanimous Decision to Become Unified Heavyweight Champion",
          "text": "Oleksandr Usyk is the new unified heavyweight world champion after dethroning Anthony Joshua with an incredible performance in London.\n\nThe Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 65,000 fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, outclassing Joshua over 12 rounds, and hurting the defending champion on numerous occasions.\n\nThe scorecards \u2013 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 \u2013 were all for Usyk and there was a mere shrug of the shoulders from Joshua as the second defeat of his professional career was confirmed.\n\nHaving seen a fight with fellow Briton Tyson Fury collapse last summer, Joshua opted to face his WBO mandatory challenger and former undisputed cruiserweight champion Usyk instead.\n\nIt appeared the easier fight for Joshua, but boxing\u2019s triumphant return to stadium nights was soured for the home crowd by a truly exceptional performance from the challenger.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Joshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn suggested his fighter may have suffered a broken eye socket and would need to go to hospital.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn\u2019t look great,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t see after the ninth round, obviously he was getting tagged a lot as well.\u201d\n\nA devastated Joshua left the ring immediately after the decision but later posted a short message on Twitter, saying: \u201cKeep positive even if the world\u2019s crumbling in front of you! London I love you & thank you each and every time!\u201d\n\nJoshua was relaxed and cheerful as he approached the ring, but concentration was etched on his face from the first bell.\n\nUsyk\u2019s abilities quickly became apparent, the 34-year-old full of feints and pace from the off, moving Joshua around the ring at will as the defending champion settled into a surprisingly passive role.\n\nA few warning shots from Joshua fell short in the early rounds, Usyk either catching them with a glove or spinning away. It would become the pattern of the fight as Usyk made Joshua miss and executed a perfect gameplan of his own.\n\nA left cross from Usyk rattled Joshua in the third round, and prompted a noisy response from the crowd.\n\nJoshua rode the danger, failing to respond, but making it to the bell safely. Usyk was now brimming with confidence and the London crowd tried in vain to rouse their man into life.\n\nA low shot from Joshua brought a complaint from Usyk and Joshua fired off another, perhaps sensing a weakness in his opponent. Round five was Joshua\u2019s best to that point, but Usyk remained in control and the Briton continued to miss his attempts to land any meaningful shots.\n\nFinally, in the sixth round, Joshua landed his right hand, sparking a response form Usyk, who widened his stance and appeared ready to trade. Joshua backed off, wary of a firefight.\n\nAnd Joshua\u2019s fears were realised in the seventh as Usyk responded brilliantly to stun him with a left hook to the chin and send him stumbling backwards. Joshua stayed on his feet, surviving the round but now in a dire predicament.\n\nUsyk was comfortably ahead on the scorecards and Joshua struggled to close the gap. The huge weight advantage was nowhere in evidence, with Usyk keeping the fight at range and urgings from Joshua\u2019s corner to move forward appearing to fall on deaf ears.\n\nJoshua had Usyk briefly on the ropes in the ninth but returned to his corner with a bloody nose having caught a hard shot to the face in the closing seconds of the round.\n\nThere was blood on the faces of both men in the 11th round. Joshua had a cut and swelling on his eye; Usyk had a gash on his left eye. But while Usyk\u2019s mouth was open, he was by far the busier fighter in the penultimate round, outclassing Joshua with ease once again.\n\nThe crowd desperately tried to inspire the defending champion, who needed a knockout in the final round. But it was the challenger who almost found the decisive punch, pushing a dazed Joshua on to the ropes.\n\nThe bell saved Joshua from suffering another knockout defeat and there was a nervous wait for Usyk\u2019s team for the scorecards.\n\nThere were to be no more shocks, however, as all three judges gave it to the challenger and ended Joshua\u2019s short second reign as world champion after just one fight.\n\nIt is unclear where Joshua goes from here. There is a rematch clause, one that the two-time world champion is likely to exercise.\n\nHe now has two losses to his name and on both occasions the Briton was dominated by a smaller man. Usyk did not find the knockout punch, but he exposed Joshua\u2019s frailties and somewhat light attacking arsenal.\n\nJoshua had no answer to Usyk and while his opponent glided across the ring, the champion appeared to be dragging his feet through mud. There was no attempt to bully Usyk, wear him down or go to the body.\n\nIt was a strange, almost hapless display from Joshua which leaves his legacy as one of the heavyweight greats in ruins.\n\nAside from the Briton\u2019s long-term career prospects, Joshua versus Fury now appears to be dead.\n\nFury fights Deontay Wilder next month in Las Vegas and every fight fan\u2019s greatest fear has been realised after the unification bout collapsed last summer.\n\nTo begin with, Joshua will have to win his rematch with Usyk which, after Saturday night\u2019s meeting, appears a near impossible prospect.\n\nJoshua\u2019s promoter Eddie Hearn said his fighter had given Usyk too much respect and would have to make \u201cfundamental changes\u201d to regain his titles.\n\n\u201cWe knew it [defeat] could happen if he didn\u2019t get it right, and he didn\u2019t get it right,\u201d Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cHe took too many shots early and Usyk was more aggressive than I thought he would be and he was the deserved winner.\n\n\u201cTony Bellew\u2019s comments about overthinking, and it fatiguing you, were right. It is like these last three or four days you get spellbound by Usyk and you end up giving him too much respect and that becomes a problem.\u201d\n\nHearn said Joshua was already thinking about how to beat Usyk next time.\n\n\u201cHe is going to go away and all he will do is think about Oleksandr Usyk. He will be thinking \u2018how can I beat him, how can I improve?\u2019 He is obsessed with improving,\u201d said Hearn.\n\n\u201cI just feel there is so much more Anthony Joshua in that fight but he will have to do a lot more in the rematch to be victorious.\u201d",

          "title": "Covid Vaccine Boosters Could Mean Billions for Drugmakers",
          "text": "Billions more in profits are at stake for some vaccine makers as the U.S. moves toward dispensing COVID-19 booster shots to shore up Americans\u2019 protection against the virus.\n\nHow much the manufacturers stand to gain depends on how big the rollout proves to be.\n\nU.S. health officials late on Thursday endorsed booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine for all Americans 65 and older \u2014 along with tens of millions of younger people who are at higher risk from the coronavirus because of health conditions or their jobs.\n\nOfficials described the move as a first step. Boosters will likely be offered even more broadly in the coming weeks or months, including boosters of vaccines made by Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. That, plus continued growth in initial vaccinations, could mean a huge gain in sales and profits for Pfizer and Moderna in particular.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity quite frankly is reflective of the billions of people around the world who would need a vaccination and a boost,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.\n\nWall Street is taking notice. The average forecast among analysts for Moderna\u2019s 2022 revenue has jumped 35% since President Joe Biden laid out his booster plan in mid-August.\n\nMost of the vaccinations so far in the U.S. have come from Pfizer, which developed its shot with Germany\u2019s BioNTech, and Moderna. They have inoculated about 99 million and 68 million people, respectively. Johnson & Johnson is third with about 14 million people.\n\nNo one knows yet how many people will get the extra shots. But Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen expects boosters alone to bring in about $26 billion in global sales next year for Pfizer and BioNTech and around $14 billion for Moderna if they are endorsed for nearly all Americans.\n\nThose companies also may gain business from people who got other vaccines initially. In Britain, which plans to offer boosters to everyone over 50 and other vulnerable people, an expert panel has recommended that Pfizer\u2019s shot be the primary choice, with Moderna as the alternative.\n\nAndersen expects Moderna, which has no other products on the market, to generate a roughly $13 billion profit next year from all COVID-19 vaccine sales if boosters are broadly authorized.\n\nPotential vaccine profits are harder to estimate for Pfizer, but company executives have said they expect their pre-tax adjusted profit margin from the vaccine to be in the \u201chigh 20s\u201d as a percentage of revenue. That would translate to a profit of around $7 billion next year just from boosters, based on Andersen\u2019s sales prediction.\n\nJ&J and Europe\u2019s AstraZeneca have said they don\u2019t intend to profit from their COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\n\nFor Pfizer and Moderna, the boosters could be more profitable than the original doses because they won\u2019t come with the research and development costs the companies incurred to get the vaccines on the market in the first place.\n\nWBB Securities CEO Steve Brozak said the booster shots will represent \u201calmost pure profit\u201d compared with the initial doses.\n\nDrugmakers aren\u2019t the only businesses that could see a windfall from delivering boosters. Drugstore chains CVS Health and Walgreens could bring in more than $800 million each in revenue, according to Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds.\n\nJonas noted that the drugstores may not face competition from mass vaccination clinics this time around, and the chains are diligent about collecting customer contact information. That makes it easy to invite people back for boosters.\n\nDrugmakers are also developing COVID-19 shots that target certain variants of the virus, and say people might need annual shots like the ones they receive for the flu. All of that could make the vaccines a major recurring source of revenue.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines have already done much better than their predecessors.\n\nPfizer said in July it expects revenue from its COVID-19 vaccine to reach $33.5 billion this year, an estimate that could change depending on the impact of boosters or the possible expansion of shots to elementary school children.\n\nThat would be more than five times the $5.8 billion racked up last year by the world\u2019s most lucrative vaccine \u2014 Pfizer\u2019s Prevnar13, which protects against pneumococcal disease.\n\nIt also would dwarf the $19.8 billion brought in last year by AbbVie\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, widely regarded as the world\u2019s top-selling drug.\n\nThis bodes well for future vaccine development, noted Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan.\n\nVaccines normally are nowhere near as profitable as treatments, Gordon said. But the success of the COVID-19 shots could draw more drugmakers and venture capitalists into the field.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine business is more attractive, which, for those of us who are going to need vaccines, is good,\u201d Gordon said.",

          "text": "The fight to succeed popular, long-serving chancellor Angela Merkel could barely be tighter as Germans go to the polls in parliamentary elections.\n\nThe streets of Berlin are hosting the annual marathon, but the biggest race is taking place across the country.\n\nIn a final push for votes, the outgoing chancellor joined conservative candidate Armin Laschet at a rally on Saturday in his hometown of Aachen.\n\nFinal opinion polls suggest an unlikely victory could be within their grasp.\n\nAt stake is the leadership of Europe\u2019s most powerful economy, and more than 60 million Germans over 18 are eligible to vote.\n\nA clear indication will come when voting comes to an end at 18:00 (16:00 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nThis unpredictable election looked over until Mrs Merkel entered the fray, her career at the top of German politics now weeks from coming to an end.\n\n\u201cIt really matters who\u2019s in power,\u201d she warned voters repeatedly in the 48 hours before the vote. Her message was that Germany needed stability and its youth needed a future \u2013 and Armin Laschet was the man to provide it.\n\nThere are plenty of uncertainties about this election. In the run-up, more than a third of voters were still unsure who to vote for, although a record number have already posted their votes in.\n\nFor months the opinion polls have swayed this way and that. The conservative CDU and its Bavarian sister party led initially, and at one point the Greens went in front, but then came a surge for the Social Democrats under Olaf Scholz.\n\nOf the three candidates competing for the role of chancellor it is Mr Scholz who has galvanised voters most. As Mrs Merkel\u2019s deputy it has been easier for him than for his conservative rival to be seen as the continuity candidate.\n\nBut even if he wins he will most likely need the support of two other parties to form a coalition.\n\n\u201cThe most important coalition for me is with the voters, because the stronger they make the SPD, the easier it will be for me to form a government,\u201d he says.\n\nFor the Greens this is their biggest moment yet. Climate change is currently the biggest issue for German voters and the party has only once polled more than 10% in a federal election.\n\nBut their candidate for the top job, Annalena Baerbock, has lost support over the summer, despite catastrophic floods that left at least 190 people dead and left a trail of destruction in two of the most populous states.\n\nJudging from a random sample of people in Berlin\u2019s sprawling Alexanderplatz on Saturday, even though climate change is their highest priority, they think the other parties are quite capable of addressing it too.\n\nConservative Armin Laschet told voters on Saturday it was time to speed up the move to renewable energy: \u201cWe\u2019re too slow in Germany.\u201d\n\nAction to tackle climate change needs to be just and fair, says German campaigner Luisa Neubauer.\n\nThe liberal FDP may disagree with the Greens on plenty, but on climate change they are drawing in young voters too. Both parties have a good chance of being in government and both could be kingmakers.\n\n\u201cThe next government is the last that can still have an active influence on the climate crisis,\u201d Annalena Baerbock warned Germans during one of the final TV debates, so the Greens had to be part of it, she said.\n\nBut liberal leader Christian Lindner does not believe Germany needs to go the same way as the Greens.\n\nEven if a clear winner emerges on Sunday evening, Germans will not know the make-up of their government for some time.\n\nThe victorious party still needs to form a coalition and there seems little chance of a repeat of the two-party grand coalition currently in charge.\n\nThat is why Germans are talking about traffic-light, Jamaica or Kenya coalitions, reflecting the different colour schemes of the parties potentially involved.\n\nIf it\u2019s the centre-left then look for the red, yellow and green; if it\u2019s the conservatives, it could be black, yellow and green.\n\nUntil that is all sorted Angela Merkel won\u2019t be going anywhere.\n\nBBC",
          "summary": "The fight to succeed popular, long-serving chancellor Angela Merkel could barely be tighter as Germans go to the polls in parliamentary elections.\nAt stake is the leadership of Europe\u2019s most powerful economy, and more than 60 million Germans over 18 are eligible to vote.\nClimate change is currently the biggest issue for German voters and the party has only once polled more than 10% in a federal election.\nThe liberal FDP may disagree with the Greens on plenty, but on climate change they are drawing in young voters too.\nThe victorious party still needs to form a coalition and there seems little chance of a repeat of the two-party grand coalition currently in charge.",

          "text": "Mali has asked Russian private companies to boost security in the conflict-torn country, Moscow confirmed as the Malian leader accused France of abandoning Bamako by preparing a large troop drawdown.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Saturday private Russian military contractors have a \u201clegitimate\u201d right to be in Mali because they were invited by the country\u2019s transitional government \u2013 but he insisted that the Russian government was not involved.\n\nMeanwhile, in his address to the UN General Assembly, Mali\u2019s Prime Minister Choguel Kokalla Maiga accused France of abandoning his country with its \u201cunilateral\u201d decision to withdraw troops.\n\nWith France preparing to reduce its military presence in the Sahel region, the Malian government estimated that \u201cits own capacities would be insufficient in the absence of external support\u201d and initiated the discussions, Lavrov told reporters on the sidelines of the UNGA.\n\n\u201cThis is an activity which has been carried out on a legitimate basis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have nothing to do with that.\u201d\n\nLavrov\u2019s comments came after European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that the bloc\u2019s ties with Mali could be seriously affected if it allows Russian private military contractors from the controversial Wagner Group to operate in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, Mali\u2019s military-dominated government in Bamako is close to hiring 1,000 Wagner paramilitaries to help it in the fight against armed groups linked to al-Qaeda and the ISIL (ISIS) armed group.\n\nFrance, which deployed more than 5,000 soldiers in the Sahel region under its Barkhane mission but has pledged a major troop drawdown, has warned Mali that hiring Wagner fighters would isolate the country internationally.\n\nGermany, which also has troops in Mali, also says it will reconsider its deployment should the Malian government strike a deal with Wagner.\n\nRussian paramilitaries, private security instructors and companies have grown increasingly influential in parts of Africa in recent years, particularly in the conflict-ridden Central African Republic (CAR), where the UN has accused Wagner contractors of committing abuses.\n\nRussia admits having deployed \u201cinstructors\u201d to CAR but says they are not active in fighting. It also insists there are no Russian paramilitaries in Libya, despite Western claims to the contrary.\n\nThe French defence ministry declined to comment on Lavrov\u2019s comments.\n\nAddressing the UNGA, Maiga said his government was justified to seek other partners to help \u201cfill the gap which will certainly result from the withdrawal of Barkhane in the north of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe new situation resulting from the end of Operation Barkhane puts Mali before a fait accompli \u2013 abandoning us, mid-flight to a certain extent \u2013 and it leads us to explore pathways and means to better ensure our security autonomously, or with other partners,\u201d he said.\n\nAlready battling armed groups in the country\u2019s north and centre, Mali slid into political turmoil last year when its military seized power from President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in a coup.\n\nUnder the threat of sanctions, the military then appointed an interim civilian government tasked with steering the country back to democratic rule.\n\nBut the powerful Colonel Assimi Goita overthrew the leaders of that interim government in May this year \u2013 in a second coup \u2013 and was later declared interim president himself, drawing international condemnation.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron announced his troop reductions in July in the aftermath of the second coup.\n\nSoldiers are due to leave some bases by the end of the year and French troops in the Sahel could fall from about 5,000 currently to 2,500 or 3,000 by 2023.\n\nThe UN, which has some 15,000 peacekeepers in Mali, has also expressed concern about the possible involvement of Wagner fighters.\n\nFollowing his press conference, Lavrov sharply criticised Paris and Berlin during his address to the annual General Assembly, accusing them of wanting to impose their vision of the world on the rest of the planet without considering different opinions.",
