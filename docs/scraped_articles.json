We all are critical stakeholders in the Ndokwa project and the establishment of a university on Ndokwa soil is a dream come true for all of us and it is worth our celebration.\n\n\u201cThe University should unite us as Ndokwa people and not the other way round and this was part of our thank you visit to the DSP Omo-Agege today. We have come to celebrate one of our own from another mother for standing-in for us when it matters most. Obi-in-Council was shocked to wake up into the reality that Ndokwa will host not just a University but that of a Federal University of Agriculture and Technology.

          "text": "By Moses Emorinken, Abuja\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed concerns over the decrease in lifesaving blood stocks across the African Region.\n\nIt noted that average blood donation rate dropped by 17 percent, the frequency of blood drives reduced by 25 percent, while the demand for blood also decreased by 13 percent with the suspension of routine surgeries in some countries and fewer people seeking care in health facilities.\n\nIt therefore urged governments, nongovernmental organisations, and blood donation organisations to put in place the systems and infrastructure needed to increase the collection of blood from voluntary donors.\n\nThe WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Matshidiso Moeti, made these known during the Commemoration of this year\u2019s World Blood Donor Day.\n\nShe said: \u201cOn 14 June, WHO celebrates World Blood Donor Day to raise awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products, like plasma. This day is also an opportunity to thank and appreciate voluntary, unpaid blood donors for this life-saving gift.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s theme is \u201cGive blood and keep the world-beating\u201d because fewer people have been donating blood during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are still around seven million patients who require this life-saving product in African countries every year.\n\n\u201cSafe blood and its transfusion are key aspects in providing quality care to save mothers haemorrhaging during childbirth and people with serious injuries. Blood is needed for surgical procedures, as well as to treat severe anemia, inherited blood disorders, and other conditions. Blood can only be stored for a limited time and so a steady supply of donations is important to make sure adequate blood products are always available.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOver the past year, blood stocks decreased in the African Region as movement restrictions and fears of infection hindered people from accessing donation sites. The average blood donation rate dropped by 17 percent and the frequency of blood drives reduced by 25 percent. Demand for blood also decreased by 13 percent with the suspension of routine surgeries in some countries and fewer people seeking care in health facilities.\u201d\n\nMoeti added: \u201cAs part of the COVID-19 response, 10 African countries are investigating the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) therapy. Among them, Ethiopia, Guinea and Mauritius have collected CCP for compassionate use and randomized control trials are ongoing in South Africa and Uganda.\n\n\u201cHowever, even during the pandemic, blood donors in many countries have made extraordinary efforts to continue to donate blood. Awareness campaigns backed by the collaboration of donor associations, civil society organizations, and armed and security forces, have led to good levels of voluntary donor recruitment in eight African countries.\n\n\u201cAs WHO we are working with a range of stakeholders to improve access to quality blood supplies. We have partnered with the Coalition of Blood for Africa (CoBA), launched in November 2020, to drive this agenda, including engaging the Organization of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD) and the private sector.\n\n\u201cThe BloodSafe Program funded by the United States of America National Institutes of Health supports research to enhance the availability of safe blood in African countries. Through this partnership, research projects in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi are underway in collaboration with universities in the United States.\n\n\u201cIn partnership with Facebook, we have set up a Regional Blood Donations feature, which connects people with nearby blood banks. The tool is now live in 12 countries and over 3.8 million Facebook users have signed up to be notified of blood donation opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraging more young people to donate blood to save lives and to inspire their peers and families to do so too. In some countries, in line with national guidance, people aged 16 and 17 can donate blood with their parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s consent, and in all countries, anyone over 18 can save someone\u2019s life by donating blood.\u201d",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has charged stakeholders in the Bonny Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) to collaborate to ensure the Train 7 project is completed safely and on time.\n\nThe President gave the charge at the virtual groundbreaking ceremony of the project in Bonny Island, Rivers State.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, the President emphasised that the speedy and safe delivery of Train 7 would encourage the timely take off of Train 8 project.\n\nHe urged the Board of Directors, management and staff of NLNG, the host communities, the Rivers State Government and other Agencies of the Federal Government to continue to collaborate to ensure completion and eventual commissioning of the Train 7 project \u201csafely and on time.\u201d\n\n\u201dAs we flag off the Train 7 project today, I look forward to the development and execution of more gas projects by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) and indigenous operators, and more Trains from Nigeria LNG to harness the over 600 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves we are endowed with.\n\n\u201dLet me use this opportunity to commend the shareholders of NLNG, the Federal Ministry of Petroleum, NNPC and the NCDMB and other stakeholders for very exemplary collaboration which has culminated in this great opportunity for Train 7.\n\n\u201dI want to thank the foreign investors for the confidence reposed in Nigeria, and assure all Nigerians and potential investors in the Oil and Gas sector that the Federal Government will continue to create the enabling environment in order to develop the sector and bring the full benefits of Gas closer to our people,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing down memory lane, President Buhari recounted that the story of Nigeria LNG was one he had been \u201dpassionately associated with during the formative years of the project.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201dAs Minister of Petroleum Resources, I kicked off our first foray in LNG Business in 1978. At the time it was already apparent that Nigeria was mainly a gas-rich country with a little oil!\n\n\u201dIt therefore gives me great joy to see the organization transform from just a project in the early 90s to a very successful company with over 20 years of responsible operations and steady supply of Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas and Natural Gas Liquids into the global market.\n\n\u201dThis is proof that Nigeria has great capacity to deliver value to the world by harnessing our natural resources\u201d.\n\nThe President, therefore, congratulated NLNG and its shareholders \u2013 NNPC, Shell, Total and Eni for proving that a Nigerian company can operate a world class business safely, profitably and responsibly.\n\nPraising the consortium for clearly setting the stage upon which Nigeria\u2019s vast gas resources will continue to grow well into the future, the President added that the focus of his administration is to boost the development of Nigeria\u2019s abundant gas resources, strengthen the gas value chain, develop the much-needed infrastructure and enhance safe operations in the sector as outlined in the National Gas Policy of 2017.\n\n\u201dThrough the Decade of Gas initiative, which I recently launched, we will transform Nigeria into a major gas and industrialised nation with gas playing the key role as revenue earner, fuel for industries and necessary feed for petrochemicals and fertiliser plants,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President also expressed delight that the NLNG as the pioneer LNG Company in Nigeria has conscientiously proven the viability of the gas sector over the years, currently contributing about one percent to Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\n\u201dNLNG has generated $114 billion in revenues over the years, paid $9 billion in taxes; $18 billion in dividends to the Federal Government and $15 billion in feed gas purchase.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dThese are commendable accomplishments by the company\u2019s 100 percent Nigerian Management Team.\n\n\u201dWith this level of performance, I can only hope that the company continues to grow starting with this Train 7 project but also positioning Nigeria to thrive through the energy transition,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his address, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva described NLNG as a \u201dblessing to the nation\u201d, noting that it has positively complemented crude oil exploration by monetising flared gas and yielding huge revenue to the nation and investors.\n\nSylva added that since NLNG became operational in 1999, the nation has recorded a drastic reduction in operational flare status from 65 per cent to 12 per cent.\n\n\u201dI boldly say that the ground breaking of Train 7 is a guarantee to every stakeholder of more dividends in terms of further reduction in gas flaring, more revenue to the nation and shareholders, more job opportunities especially at the construction phase and more social investments for the society, \u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Anthony Attah, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of NLNG, said the Train 7 will increase NLNG\u2019s overall capacity to 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) from the current 22 million mtpa, while further adding immense value to the nation and the people.\n\nAttah noted that the project would stimulate inflow of about 10 billion dollars FDI into Nigeria, create 12,000 direct jobs in Bonny Island and additional 40,000 indirect construction jobs.\n\nHe said the project would also further the development of local capacity and businesses through the 100 per cent in-country execution of construction works, fabrications and major procurement.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria has ridden on the back of oil for over 50 years, but with this Train 7 project Nigeria is now set and I believe it is now time to fly on the wings of gas,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",
          "summary": "As far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security.\nThe Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\nAt what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019?\nSince most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes?",

When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling party to address the separatist agitations in the country through democratic means instead of deployment of military.\n\nHe said the fact that things are bad and people hungry and angry was not questionable, saying that these were worldwide phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Odigie-Oyegun decried the current security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that we will begin to get control of the security of this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke during the public presentation of a book, APC\u2019s Litmus Tests, written by Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "title": "Clark Chastises President, Northern Elders for Silence over Jihadists\u2019 Threat to Delta",
          "text": "\u2022MEND warns Fulani group against planned attack\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nThe leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Chairman of Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), Chief Edwin Clark, yesterday expressed concern over the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari and Northern elders to threats by Fulani jihadists and Miyetti Allah to attack Delta State for supporting the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe told reporters in Abuja that given their promptness in reacting to similar threats to herdsmen, he had expected Buhari and the Northern elders to condemn the threats to Delta State.\n\nThe group, on Sunday, had given Delta State a 72-hour ultimatum to review its ban on open grazing or risk an attack.\n\nThe group stated that it was angered by the fact that the Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, hosted the May 11, 2021 meeting of the governors of the 17 Southern states in Asaba, where they resolved to ban open grazing in their domains.\n\nWhile claiming to be protecting the Uthman Dan Fodio heritage of free open grazing in Nigeria and the entire West Africa sub-region, the group asked Okowa to disown the position of the Southern governors on open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe group threatened to attack Asaba and Agbor unless Okowa withdrew his support to open grazing ban.\n\nIt also claimed responsibility for last week\u2019s fire at the Federal Secretariat in Asaba, which destroyed the second floor office of the NYSC completely.\n\nBut in a counter move, another group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta cautioned the self-styled \u2018Fulani Jihadists\u2019 group against attacking the state.\n\nClark, while condemning the silence of the federal government and Northern elders said open grazing was buried for good in all the 17 Southern states.\n\nAccording to him, the Northern elders who are always quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have not deemed it fit to call the jihadists to order.\n\nHe expressed concern that less than one week after leaders of thought, traditional rulers and others, including himself, met on the state of the nation, the Fulani jihadists issued a threat to attack Delta State.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have watched with restrained patience, the reckless and irresponsible utterances of the so-called Fulani jihadists and the Miyetti Allah, who believe that they own Nigeria from the North to the sea, and, therefore, have the impunity to warn state governments, particularly the Delta State government and governor, to withdraw, within 72 hours, his decision against open grazing, recently taken by the 17 governors of the South, in a meeting held in Asaba.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have decided to issue this advice and warning to the federal government and the Fulani jihadists that the people of the Niger Delta will resist in such a way that will make it definitely impossible for the federal government\u2019s security forces to cope with should this action escalate.\n\n\u201cWe are reacting because this is not the first time the Fulani and their collaborators have insulted our people. It will be remembered that sometime in 2009, a legislator from Kebbi State in the National Assembly asked the federal government to resettle the people of the Niger Delta in another territory to create a conducive and unhindered atmosphere for the oil companies to operate.\n\n\u201cThat we warn, the resulting consequences will be very unpleasant to them. The federal government has continuously condoned them and behaving as if the federal government is the one giving support to these Fulani Jihadists and the Miyetti Allah because what is happening today in Nigeria, which has resulted in unprecedented insecurity and bad governance in Nigeria will be worse if they are not called to order by the federal government within the shortest time possible.\n\n\u201cFor some Fulani Jihadists to issue such insulting and provocative 72 hours\u2019 notice to the governor of Delta State, without the federal government and the elders of Northern extraction ever calling them to order, is most disappointing, considering that the same Northern elders were quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning IPOB.\n\n\u201cSuch impudence of the Fulani Jihadists will no longer be tolerated. They even claimed responsibility for the burning/bombing of the secretariat in Asaba, which also houses the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Office.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision on open grazing and other decisions are taken on national interest by the 17 Southern governors received the full support of the people of Southern Nigeria, particularly the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo of the South-east, PANDEF of the South-south and the Afenifere of the South-west.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe will no longer tolerate hate and divisive statements targeted at deriding and insulting others, from these Fulani who believe Nigeria is exclusively theirs and other Nigerians are their subjects, and not their fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cI repeat, on behalf of Southerners, that open grazing has been finally buried in Southern Nigeria. For Mr. President to insist that open grazing should continue whereby he asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to dig out the gazette that approved open grazing in the First Republic is unbelievable, unpatriotic and unacceptable to our people.\u201d\n\nClark also explained how far critical stakeholders have gone in addressing the crisis rocking the country, saying that \u201cin order to maintain and promote a peaceful Nigeria, I was among other 50 prominent Nigerians, including former heads of state, traditional rulers, former chief justices, that met for nine hours, under the leadership of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, recently on Thursday, 11th June 2021, at the Conference Hall of the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, where valuable decisions were taken to maintain and sustain the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nClark told Buhari to regard himself as president of one Nigeria, and not as president of the Fulani or the Northerners, adding that Nigerians shall resist, at all cost, any attempt to subjugate them.\n\nHe cautioned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, against what he described as his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which he said is misleading the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI also use this opportunity to seriously advise the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which is misleading and misdirecting Mr. President. Because the rhetoric question Mr. President asked during his interview with ARISE Television, whether Nigerians want him (Mr. President) to contradict the Attorney-General of the Federation, was based on his understanding of the AG\u2019s advice to him.\n\n\u201cThe AG\u2019s position is provided for in the constitution and he is expected to be independent of parochial and unconstitutional government decisions. He behaves as if his position is that of a minister of justice alone.\n\n\u201cThis was the reason why at the 2014 National Conference it was recommended that the post of the Attorney-General recognised by the constitution should be separated from that of the minister of justice who owes his allegiance to the government in power that appointed him.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Mr. President is not aware, or he has not been advised by the AG that the Land Use Act, which vested ownership of land on the state governor is entrenched in the constitution of the country. Therefore, any gazette or law passed by any State or National Assembly is and will be null and void because the 1999 Constitution supersedes all such laws or gazette notices.\n\n\u201cThe President has no power or authority to impose open grazing on state governments. Such illegal actions which are a breach of the 1999 Constitution will not be accepted and will be legally resisted at all costs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any law banning open grazing by state governments is not only legal and binding but is unchallengeable and binding on any person or group of persons, including the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nClark, however, appealed to the president to call for national dialogue over insecurity and general violence, with Nigerians of various ethnic nationalities, adding that the various calls by groups for secession and breakup of the country are not healthy.\n\nHe said the Buhari needed to have a peaceful government until his exit from office in 2023, and canvassed the restructuring of the nation and return to a federal system of government as it was in 1963, before the military took over in 1966.\n\nMEND Warns \u2018Fulani Jihadist\u2019 Group against Attack on Delta\n\nMeanwhile, a group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta has cautioned a self-styled Fulani jihadist group against attacking Delta State.\n\nThe group warned of dire consequences should the Fulani or Usman Dan Fodio heritage leadership group carry out their threat to Delta and the governor, after the three-day ultimatum.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cResponse to the Fulani Threat to Okowa on Open Grazing by Southern Governors\u201d and signed off as \u201cDragon War, MEND\u201d, the group said: \u201cWe are warning that if your threat is made to come to fulfilment, No Fulani will ever exist across the Niger Delta and all oil facilities linked to a Fulani will be brought down. If one soul is lost, 10 Fulani souls will pay for it. If one facility is destroyed, 10 Fulani facilities will be destroyed. We will respond proportionately ten times whatever you give, the corresponding response will not be limited to the Delta, it may be with your politicians or with your rulers.\n\n\u201cWe will launch three rocket launchers and ballistic missiles at any facility of our choice as a warning in seven days if you make bold your threats.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make cheap our threats. We have shut down the country and we can at any time shut you down. We are the Niger Delta. We stand for the interest of the Niger Delta and we will not allow any coward to threaten us. We fight without running. Be warned!\u201d\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command, in a statement by its spokesman, Mr. Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, waved off the reported threat by the faceless group, describing it as inconsequential and something to simply ignore.\n\nThe statement by the police advised the people in the state to go about their lawful activities without fear of intimidation or attacks from any quarter.\n\nThe police attributed the source of the leaflet reportedly posted at different conspicuous points at Agbor and Asaba, including on walls near the Government House, as the handiwork of miscreants who were intent on creating panic among law-abiding residents in the state and escalating insecurity in the country.\n\nThe statement said the police were unwavering in their commitment to the security of lives and property of the people of Delta State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges Buhari not to bully secessionists, forget open grazing\n\nJames Emejo, Emmanuel Addeh, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nA Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, yesterday stated that Nigeria cannot remain one country if it fails to decentralise as fast as possible, adding that analysts, retired generals and others have maintained the same position.\n\nSoyinka spoke to ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to be more sensitive to the agitations of secessionists rather than bully them.\n\n\u201cIf it (Nigeria) fails to decentralise, some people use the word reconstruction, some use whatever. But if Nigeria fails to decentralise as fast as possible, manifestly, not as rhetoric, then Nigeria cannot stay together,\u201d he warned, adding: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not Wole Soyinka saying this. Everybody has said it; generals have said it; ex-heads of state have said it; politicians have said it; analysts have said it; economists have said it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to people in the streets. That\u2019s why they are moving; that\u2019s why they are demonstrating; that\u2019s why they are defying threats from the police and from the government that if you demonstrate, you are traitors or you do this, we\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that people are no longer intimidated by Buhari\u2019s threat that \u2018we will talk to you in the only way you understand.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t wash with anybody any longer because if a nation is on a suicidal slide, the people who feel that they do not deserve that kind of suicidal plunge have a right to say \u2018sorry, I am getting off before it nosedives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn how to make the system work again, he said: \u201cIt relates to what I was saying earlier. It is because he (Buhari) is not listening or he\u2019s listening and he\u2019s not understanding so that we do not have this extreme moment to say, wait a minute, there is nobody out there, we better look after our own security, we better look after our own very existence.\u201d\n\nHe accused governors and senators of not doing enough to confront the challenges facing the country.\n\nHe said while the Senate has not utilised its powers to force the government to act the way it should, the governors appeared to be too timid to act.\n\nSoyinka added that Buhari is not listening to the yearnings of Nigerians, and his administration did not really understand the applications, full responsibilities and commitments involved in a democratic regime.\n\nHe said he was alarmed at the understanding of democracy by the top hierarchy of government.\n\nHe stated that the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria aborted the various channels of self-expression open to any kind of polity and abrogated the essence of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe politicians are not doing enough, especially the Senate. If you study the constitution very carefully, you will find out that they have certain powers which they haven\u2019t touched. I have discussed this with constitutional lawyers. There are certain areas in which they can act, they can force this government, compel this government to act the way it should.\n\n\u201cAnd that also applies especially to governors. The governors themselves are too tentative; they are too timid. There are certain areas of the constitution, in which, as I go back to my favourite expression, they can push the envelope, completely, so that we get a sense of governance at all tiers, and have synergy going on. I think people are ready to stand behind the leaders.\u201d\n\nSoyinka said Twitter\u2019s suspension showed that democracy means different things to different people.\n\nHe also condemned the language used by Buhari in his interview recently and even in his statements from Aso Rock in relation to those who are clamouring for secession.\n\nAccording to him, when a group makes such agitations, any sensitive leadership must learn to understand this and respond to the reasons behind those agitations and not start threatening and bullying and trying to intimidate people because they are giving vent to deep-seated grievances.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor instance, there was a question I listened to President Buhari on this very channel (ARISE) about the position of the various governors on open grazing. At least 50 per cent of the nation has their representatives, saying that within the constitution, within the democratic dispensation that we say we are operating- we are saying on behalf of our people that we do not want open grazing anymore. And then somebody sits in Aso Rock and says to them that well, there is a cattle constitution, I am instructing my attorney-general to dig up some kind of law, colonial law which arbitrated between farmers and herders\u2026so that I can recover on behalf of a certain private business, the whole routes \u2013 which means that he is not listening to what people are saying, he\u2019s not listening to what the governors representing them are saying.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying I am going to restore the routes by referring to some colonial arrangements. Now, when I listen to a thing like that I really despair. I want to say this, it was a very instructive interview, and no doubt there was nothing new. One was just hoping that this government had transcended that kind of partisan thinking.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG committed to its loans repayment obligations, Says Amaechi\n\nJames Emejo, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday unfolded plans by the federal government to take more Chinese loans to expand rail services to more states.\n\nAmaechi, who featured on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said the federal government had already begun negotiations for the loans.\n\nIf granted, it will balloon Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock, which, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO), stood at $87.239 billion as of March 31, 2021.\n\nAlready, there has been an outcry against Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile since 2015.\n\nLast Thursday, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had admitted that the federal government was exceeding its borrowing plan for 2021.\n\nAhmed, in an interview with France 24, monitored by THISDAY, had blamed the development on the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices.\n\nHowever, Amaechi said Nigeria had been fulfilling its loan obligations as it had never defaulted in the repayment of loans, especially for the railway projects.\n\nHe stated that the federal government had so far repaid over $150 million out of the $500 million facility secured by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan for the Abuja-Kaduna railway.\n\nThe minister added that monthly revenue from the Abuja-Kaduna railway operation has increased from N70 million to N350 million as of May.\n\nHe also refuted the suggestion that some obnoxious clauses in the Chinese loan agreements may lead to mortgaging Nigeria\u2019s assets in the case of default.\n\nThe minister clarified that he was not behind the recent suspension of the Managing Director of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nHe said Bala-Usman was not suspended but only asked to \u2018step aside\u2019 to enable an investigation into the management of the authority from 2016 to date.\n\nAmaechi said President Muhammadu Buhari would decide on the resumption of the embattled NPA boss after the conclusion of the probe.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cWhen you take the loan, you are expected to pay back and as we are talking today we are paying back.\n\n\u201cUnder the regime of former President Goodluck Jonathan, the loan for Abuja \u2013 Kaduna was about $500 million. As of today, we have paid over $150 million on that loan.\n\n\u201cAnd Nigeria has never defaulted when it comes to loan repayment. And I don\u2019t also expect that we will default on any other loan we have taken.\n\n\u201cThe loan for Ibadan-Kano is about $1.5 billion. The rest of $500 million came from our budget. I expect that whatever loans we take we will be able to pay.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that there is any clause in the loan agreement that hands over any of our national assets to China.\n\n\u201cYes, in default they go to court and it depends on the outcome of the court case, but I am not aware that there is anything in all the clauses signed by this government or the previous government of Goodluck Jonathan that mortgaged any of our national assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line of the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri railway as well as that of Kano -Maradi will commence in June.\n\nHe added that the Lagos-Kano narrow gauge is currently being negotiated with different interest groups willing to rehabilitate it.\n\nHe explained: \u201cWhat we are going to start this June is the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line.\n\nWe are rehabilitating Port Harcourt -Maiduguri and at the same time the president has directed that contract be awarded for the standard gauge, which should be funded when the next government comes.\n\n\u201cBut the difference between the narrow gauge and the standard gauge is just the speed. The Lagos -Kano narrow gauge is the one we are negotiating with different interest groups who want to rehabilitate.\n\n\u201cThat one is for rehabilitation. And when they finish rehabilitation, they will then run it by themselves and make their money and pay themselves back. We\u2019ve not even commenced negotiation.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said more Chinese loans would be needed to extend the railway services to other states.\n\nHe said although the Lagos-Ibadan rail line had been completed, the services were still skeletal because it would take six months to test equipment to ensure they are in perfect condition.\n\nHe, however, stated that to extend the railway service from Ibadan to Osogbo and from Kano to Kaduna as well as other states in the country, the country would need to get more Chinese loans of which negotiations were already in progress.\n\n\u201cIt takes six months to know that that equipment is in perfect condition. We would continue to test the equipment so that we do not have any train accidents. So we are moving from just two services in a day to four. It will be a gradual progression and I believe that by the end of the year, we will be doing 16 trips in a day,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe also said the continuation of the rail line would only commence when the Chinese loan was obtained, adding that the ministry has already mobilised contractors with some funds pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we get the Chinese loan, we would commence the construction of Ibadan to Abuja, but before the end of this month, we should commence some of the Kano-Kaduna rail. We have already mobilised the contractors with some funds and we would fund it initially from our budget pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded\u201d, Amaechi said.\n\nOn the security of the railway system against the backdrop of the activities of vandals and other economy saboteurs, Amaechi canvassed the amendment of the law to make perpetrators liable for manslaughter as well as serve as a deterrence to others.\n\nHe said terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa seaport.\n\nAccording to him, the Apapa seaport\u2019s only problem is efficiency, citing the drastic change in the port on the day the president visited to inaugurate the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was in the train with the president on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the port that looked like a marketplace was very well organised; no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe stated: \u201cIf they had the capacity in just one night, because I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; if that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the president to come before we can be efficient?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done was to have a meeting with the terminal operators and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the seaport? The seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the seaport unless I have business in the seaport.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said the Ministry of Transportation would partner the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding that freighting of cargoes from the seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also ease congestion at the ports.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says terminal operators to contribute to reconstruction of Apapa port\n\nSays deep blue project to solve maritime insecurity, boost revenue, reduce oil production cost\n\nBy Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi, has said the problem of Apapa seaport is efficiency, citing the drastic changes in the Port on the day the President visited to commission the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe also said that terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa Seaport.\n\nThe Minister stated this Monday when he appeared as a guest on The Morning Show on Arise TV, THISDAY broadcast arm.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was in the train with the President on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the Port that looked like a market place was very well organised, no persons were found loitering about, no trucks.

Do we need to wait for the President to come before we can be efficient?\u201d Amaechi queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done, was to have a meeting with the terminal operators, and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa Seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa Seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the Seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the Seaport? The Seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as Minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the Seaport unless I have business in the seaport\u201d, he added.\n\nAmaechi noted that the Ministry of Transportation will partner with the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding thatt freighting of cargoes from the Seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also help in arresting the situation at the Port.\n\n\u201cWe are going to partner with customs because they are largely involved. Between them and the NPA, they are the operators (or regulators) of the Seaport, and see how to arrest this situation. I believe that when we begin to freight cargoes from the seaport through the rail, we\u2019ll reduce some of the challenges that we have at the seaport\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also spoke on the recently launched Deep Blue Project being overseen by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, stating that the project will not only boost security in the country\u2019s waters, but will also improve trade in the Gulf of Guinea and reduce cost of production for the Oil industry, while improving revenue for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cbefore we came, various contractors were contracted to provide security for oil companies in the water. There was a case between the government and OMSL in which the company provides about 3 or 4 boats to the Navy and they collect $2500 per vessel for the first day and $1500 for about 30 days. In a year, like in 2020 they made about $67m, and when you hand over the security of a country to individuals, it becomes very challenging and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cSo, the President kindly approved that the Police, Army, Air force and other security agencies should be involved in providing security with the equipment that we have provided.\n\n\u201cWe have about 3 helicopters, 2 fixed-wing planes, 17 interceptor boats, 2 vessels, drones, and more; what it does is that it gives you information about where the criminals are, those who go and destroy pipes just because they are looking for oil to bunker.\n\n\u201cIt provides you that information, then you deter them or arrest them. So, we are able to provide security in the coastal region, both on land and on the sea. Now, those who provide the coastal security on land will be the Nigerian Army and the Police, and we\u2019ve provided them with all the necessary tools they need.\n\n\u201cWe have ammunition, we have vehicles, like Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and all that for patrol by the coast. All that, we believe will begin to yield fruits between now and next year.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Amaechi said, \u201cWhat , we\u2019ve done with Deep Blue project is that we will reduce the cost of producing oil in Nigeria, because in producing oil, they also build-in the cost of security. By the time we provide this security in the water, the economy will be improved because there will be more money coming into the economy. That\u2019s the impact it will have when it comes to the Deep Blue project.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Israelis who did the training said in six months to one year, if there is no improvement in the economy in terms of how much comes in, both to NIMASA, NPA and the oil industry, \u2018come back to us and we\u2019ll be willing to refund.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you know it is simple mathematics; It is true that the moment you can take away the criminals from the water, and the contractors from the water, then the cost of security which is borne either by NNPC or the Oil Companies will be part of what will come back to us as income. Then on land, in all our rail and train coaches, you have enough armed policemen in any trip we are making to withstand any criminal attack.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Sheriff Oborevwori, also said at the weekend that the two arms of government in the state were no longer dependent on the executive arm as \u201cthey are already enjoying financial autonomy in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said the state had concluded plans to ensure the take-off of the Delta State Accounts Allocation Committee (DSAAC) and State Assembly Service Commission (DSASC), adding that the enabling legislation was delayed by the PASAN strike.\n\nEbonyi State Chairman of PASAN, Mrs. Uche Edene, told THISDAY that the state had gradually started the implementation of the financial autonomy even before the strike started.\n\nShe stated that the state had enacted Fund Management Law in 2016 which gave birth to the State House of Assembly Commission.\n\nIn Oyo State, the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Oyelowo Oyewo, told THISDAY that the state has already established the Assembly Service Commission while that of the State Accounts Allocation Committee (SAAC) was ongoing.\n\nHe said before the strike by JUSUN, the state already had a committee involving all stakeholders working towards funds management for the judiciary and legislative arms.\n\nChairman of JUSUN in Taraba State, Mr. Muhammed Usman, told THISDAY that the House of Assembly has to pass the Taraba State Legislative Management Bill and Judiciary Management Bill into law before the setting up SAAC.\n\nIn addition, Sokoto State Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Mr. Suleiman Usman (SAN), told THISDAY that by principle, the state had granted autonomy to the judiciary and legislature since 2017, adding that Governor Aminu Tambuwal would soon send a bill to the House of Assembly for passage into law.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with THISDAY the Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to Governor Bello Mutawalle of Zamfara State, Mr Zailani Bappa, said the governor was determined to implement the agreement reached with JUSUN and PASAN.\n\nNasarawa State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Dogo Shama, also told THISDAY that the state was gearing up for the setting up of SAAC.\n\nNational Treasurer of Parliamentary Association of Nigeria, Mr. Umar Azara, also confirmed that both the State Assembly Service Commission and Fund Management bills have been put in place in Nasarawa State and are awaiting passage.\n\nKano State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, said the state government was ready to set up SAAC and the State Assembly Service Commission to enable it to disburse revenue directly to the two other arms of government in the state.\n\nThe Chairman of Akwa Ibom State chapter of JUSUN, Mr. Oku Umoh, also told THISDAY that the state legislature has to put in place the Legislative Service Commission and the Fund Management Law, while the three arms of government will meet to set up SAAC.\n\nChairman of JUSUN in Cross River State, Mr. Asang Ebong, told THISDAY that the three arms of government were already working on a draft bill for the setting up of SAAC.\n\nJUSUN Chairman, Ondo State, Mr. Femi Afolabi, said the SAAC would be set up after the Fund Management Committee Law, had been passed by the Ondo State House of Assembly and assented to by the Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nIn Katsina State, the Governor, Hon.

The initial plan was a fake protest for June 12, hoping the team led by Sowore would accidentally join the protest. With this, they would turn the protest to a violent one and attack Sowore and others but they cancelled the plan after your (SaharaReporters') story,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had last week exposed how Asefon in a meeting with Nigeria's Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba promised to mobilise against those planning to protest on June 12, using his power as NANS President.\n\n\u201cHe met with the Inspector of General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba three days ago but the IGP refused to take pictures with him, telling him there was a crisis in NANS and he was not sure Asefon was in control.\n\n\u201cAsefon then told him he is the original President with the structure of the students\u2019 body.\n\n\u201cHe then asked the IGP for assistance and the condition given to him was to mobilise against the people planning protests on June 12 if truly he is the original NANS President.\n\n\u201cHe immediately promised the IGP to consider it done. He said they would initially join the rally and later disrupt it,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe newspaper also revealed how the Nigerian government ordered the management of PPMC to pay Asefon N40 million to mobilise thugs in major cities across the country with police cover and unleash terror on genuine protesters on June 12.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has announced a tender process for the sale of a 40% stake in state-owned telecommunications company, Ethio Telecom. That means potential investors can now register their interest starting Tuesday. This is the first stage in a lengthy process that will lead to the selection of a successful bidder.\n\nThe proposed minority sale of Ethio Telecom \u2013 the sole mobile services provider in a country of over 100 million people \u2013 is part of a broader plan to liberalise the country\u2019s monopolistic telecoms sector. In addition, two foreign carriers are to be granted licenses to operate in the hugely untapped market.\n\n\u201cThe government wants state-owned enterprises to be competitive and productive, the authorities\u2019 motivation for selling a part of Ethio Telecom to private operators,\u201d Deputy Director of Public Enterprises, Holding and Administration Agency, Zinabu Yirga, said at a press conference in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday. \u201cAs part of the broader opening up of the sector, Ethiopia is also moving to license private operators to compete with Ethio Telecom.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in 2019 and driven by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the liberalisation plan has been met with several delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an internal crisis in the Tigray region.\n\nHowever, the plan has gathered pace over the past six months. In May, the government awarded one of the two available private operating licences to break up Ethio Telecom\u2019s monopoly on the sector.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a telco-consortium led by Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, was announced as the winner after a successful bid of around $850 million. Meanwhile, a second offer of around $600 million from South Africa\u2019s MTN Group was deemed too low by the regulator, which is now preparing to reauction the final licence.\n\nAccording to Brook Taye, a senior advisor at the finance ministry, the 40% in Ethio Telecom will be sold as a single stake to a single investor. It is however unclear how much the stake would be worth but the tender process is sure to attract significant interest from many telcos around the world.\n\nThis is due to the attractiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s untapped telecoms market. In a population of over 100 million people, only about 20% have access to the Internet, less than 40% have a mobile phone and only 5.8% of the people use social media, according to a report from DataReportal.\n\nFounded in November 2010, Ethio Telecom currently has around 53 million subscribers and has since December generated a revenue of around $600 million. According to reports, the government plans to retain a 55% stake in the operator while the remaining 5% will be offered to domestic investors through an initial public offering.",

          "title": "Here are ten VPNs you can use in Nigeria",
          "text": "Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been around for a long time but have become more popular recently. Whether you want to use it to watch a show that\u2019s not available in your country or access a site that\u2019s been banned by the government, there\u2019s one question that most people have had to deal with: Which VPN should I use?\n\nIt can be daunting to choose from the hundreds, if not thousands, of VPN services available. So we\u2019ve come up with a list of ten reputable VPN services you can use.\n\nExpress VPN\n\nExpressVPN is rated highly because of its very fast speeds across over 3,000 remote servers in 160 locations and 94 countries. It provides advanced security on both apps and servers.\n\nIts high quality comes at a price. The lowest monthly plan is priced at $6.67, making it slightly more expensive than its rivals. It\u2019s also currently unavailable on the Nigerian App Store.\n\nA user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cI\u2019ve been using ExpressVPN for over a year now, mostly to watch Netflix from other countries. I also use it for HBO Max and Disney+. I\u2019ve had to move to another VPN because I need to use it on my phone \u201d\n\nNord VPN\n\nUnlike ExpressVPN, NordVPN is available on the Nigerian App Store, it has one of the fastest speeds on the market and it\u2019s cheaper than ExpressVPN: Its lowest price is $4.89/month. It has more than 5,200 servers in 62 countries.\n\nNordVPN has a feature that ExpressVPN doesn\u2019t have, it\u2019s called VPN chaining. It routes your traffic through two servers, encrypting data packets twice. A helpful security feature, but it slows down your connection.\n\nProton VPN\n\nProton has the best free subscription in the market. Unlike NordVPN and ExpressVPN, the first subscription tier of ProtonVPN is its free VPN offering, which includes just three VPN server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US). It has over 1,246 Servers in 55 countries.\n\nThis free subscription offers unlimited browsing bandwidth but at slower internet speeds. It only allows one device to be connected at a time and also has few server locations compared to most other VPN providers.\n\nTunnelBear\n\nTunnelBear offers its users both free and paid VPN services. However, the free version is only limited to 500MB/month bandwidth.\n\nIt\u2019s not as fast as ExpressVPN and NordVPN but has a decent speed. It has servers in 22 locations, which means fewer options for its users.\n\nA user Techcabal spoke to said, \u201cI started using Tunnelbear, but I\u2019m being very Nigerian about it so I refuse to pay after I exhaust my 500MB limit in a few days.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t do much on the internet, TunnelBear would be a good fit.\n\nWindscribe VPN\n\nJust like TunnelBear, Windscribe VPN has a free version and it gives 10GB free every month. It\u2019s safe and secure to use. It works on most devices and most streaming services. It has 180 servers in over 63 countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved to Windscribe. They give 10GB free every month, so that\u2019s nice.\u201d A user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cThe only thing is it definitely drains my battery. I don\u2019t like the mental stress of having to connect to a VPN before opening Twitter, then having to remember to turn it off before I do other things like open YouTube. I opened YouTube earlier today from Dallas, Texas and it loaded straight into 1080p. I was shocked. Americans are enjoying themselves. I hate this VPN life. Also having to remember to turn off my VPN before I use my bank app. \u201c\n\nIPVanish\n\nIPVanish stands out because it allows unlimited simultaneous connections. It has over 500 servers spread across 55 countries.\n\nIt has no free version. It costs $10 per month, or $77.99 billed annually. You can alternatively opt to pay $26.99 every three months.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow for more customisation and it has a confusing privacy policy.\n\nCyberGhost\n\nCyberGhost has been around for a while and it serves more than 15 million users. It boasts 6,700+ servers in 110+ locations across 90 countries. That\u2019s far more than all others.\n\nCyberGhost offers a VPN service for virtually every device out there but it\u2019s more expensive than a few others. It costs $12.99 per month, $47.94 for six months and $49.50 for eighteen months. Additionally, a student discount is available, the cost of the student offering is $2.75 per month, and you\u2019ll have to sign on to a year-long contract.\n\nPsiphon\n\nThis VPN separates itself away from the pack by not needing an email address to use it. You can download the free app (on all platforms except MacOS, Linux, or routers) and start using it immediately. It uses an open-source code which increases transparency\n\nA downside is that because it\u2019s free, it has a very small server network \u2013 a little over 20 countries. It\u2019s slower than other alternatives out there. It doesn\u2019t work with Netflix or torrenting. It explicitly says that it\u2019s not a privacy tool.\n\nPsiphon is supported by ads, and it does share statistics with sponsors so they can see, for example, how often their sites are visited through Psiphon and from which countries. These are further aggregated by date, sponsor and region. All of the data Psiphon collects is discarded after 60 days.\n\nSurfShark\n\nSurfshark has been around for roughly a year now. It offers a safe and private connection. It\u2019s available on many platforms. Its speed is pretty good.\n\nIt has over 1,000 servers in more than 61 countries. For a relatively new service provider, this is a very large network and something that many VPN service providers haven\u2019t achieved even after years in the business.\n\nYou can use SurfShark on unlimited devices and its lowest price per month is $2.49/ for 2 years.\n\nPrivate VPN\n\nPrivateVPN is a great all-rounder with excellent privacy and high speeds. Its reliable connections and ability to unblock sites like Netflix make it ideal for streaming. It can also be used to torrent and works well in China.\n\nWith only around 200 servers, it\u2019s still pretty much a good choice. It\u2019s lowest monthly cost is $2.08.\n\nThat\u2019s all from us. These are our top ten VPNs. Which other VPNs do you use and what do you like or don\u2019t like about them?",

          "text": "When Pearl\u00e9 Nwaezeigwe is not busy creating policies that protect African users on TikTok, she spends most of her time planning for her future, creating inspirational videos targeted at young people with ambitious career goals, and settling into her new community in Ireland.\n\nTikTok\u2019s presence and influence cannot be denied in Africa. The app is perfect for hyper-creative content creators who know their way around editing tools and special effects. But even amateur video creators, dancers, and comedians are also making waves and growing their TikTok following every day. As TikTok\u2019s popularity soars, the company is intentional about creating policies that protect both creators and viewers.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Pearl\u00e9 to Centre Stage because I\u2019m inspired by how dedicated she is to honing her craft, learning more about product policy, and fighting for human rights. As a social activist, Pearl\u00e9 isn\u2019t afraid to speak against policies that harm our fundamental human rights, making her the perfect fit for her role at TikTok.\n\nFor the love of TikTok in Africa\n\nWhat about TikTok\u2019s presence in Africa excites you?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It\u2019s exciting to see how well the creative industry is thriving and booming, especially on TikTok. I feel very inspired when I see creators showcasing their many talents on our platform. And TikTok videos go beyond captions and hashtags \u2013 creators have to bring their A-game and capture multiple viewers\u2019 attention within the first ten seconds and keep them watching for up to a minute. Also, African TikTokers are showing us that we all have shared experiences. They are also showing the world how diverse Africans at home and in the diaspora.\n\nWhat kind of freedom does TikTok give to African content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It gives them the freedom to showcase how rich our culture is and how talented we are as a people. Nigerian and South African creators are especially famous for their dance and comedic videos. TikTok gives them the opportunity to be as expressive as they want to be as long as they stick to our community guidelines.\n\nLet\u2019s get personal\n\nTell me about the last good book you read?\n\nPearl\u00e9: A lot of people find self-help and motivational books very cheesy, but I enjoy reading them.\n\nI recently read \u2018You Are a Badass\u2019. I like the way the book was written because it does not contain a lot of rules and regulations. She uses storytelling to encourage her readers to focus on what matters and the beauty of life. I also love that each chapter ends with a reminder to love yourself and the special parts of you.\n\n\u2018Loud black girls\u2019 is next on my list. It contains a compilation of short stories by different black women living in the UK. The book delves into their experiences with living, working and navigating life in the UK. I\u2019ve always seen the black and POC experience from the lenses of women living in Nigeria and the US, but Loud Black Girls opened my eyes to see how black women deal with racism and microaggression in the UK. \u201c\n\nWhat are some of your favourite accounts on social media?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I tell people that I am obsessed with The Verge because they have a section dedicated to Tech Policy. I\u2019m a policy nerd. I also read TC Daily and I have to say, it\u2019s exciting to see how much innovation is coming out of Africa. For tech policy related news and updates, I follow Wired, MITTech, and Access Now.\n\nWho are your favourite content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Beyonc\u00e9, obviously. I also follow Shesecures, Useshukran, and Fbeinghumble on social media. On TikTok, I enjoy watching King Science. He uses animated videos to address sensitive topics and create content that is easy to digest and understand.\n\nInfusing creativity, learning new skills and making an impact\n\nWhat kind of skills do you need to be successful in your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Firstly, you need a fundamental understanding of human rights. We want people to express themselves and feel inspired to create but we also want them to feel safe on our platform.\n\nSecondly, you need to understand the local context. The trends that are peculiar to one region will be different from the rising trends in a different region. We have to pay close attention to gender, religious, and cultural nuances. Most of the popular trends we see on TikTok are fun, but some have potential to be harmful.\n\nLastly, you need to research industry standards. We aren\u2019t as focused on competition as much as we are on collaboration. There are trends that crossover from other social media platforms into TikTok \u2013 which isn\u2019t unusual \u2013 but we have to ensure that crossover trends don\u2019t harm or impede our users\u2019 privacy and rights.\n\nWhat impactful lessons have you learned on the job so far?\n\nPearl\u00e9: My dad calls me an activist because I like (non-violently) fighting for people. When I think about impact, I think about the fact that I see the policies we create getting enacted in real time. The speed at which we push these policies matters because our users need to feel safe at all times. I\u2019m especially excited that the policies we come up with are focused on protecting creators in Sub-saharan Africa.\n\nWhat is your role teaching you about content creation?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I\u2019ve learned that content creation has many layers. When I think about the time that goes into creating a really dope animated video or beauty vlog, I appreciate how much creators put into giving us their best works. You might watch a one minute animated video on TikTok without realizing how much effort went into putting it together. I\u2019d say watching these TikTokers create magic is my favourite part of the job.\n\nWhat makes TikTok stand out from other content creation platforms?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I can\u2019t speak for other platforms but TikTok draws a lot of Gen-Z and millennial creators. Again, people feel safe on our platform. When creators come on TikTok, we give them the tools they need to express themselves without fear of being shut down, threatened, or abused. It\u2019s better to create from a place of freedom than fear.\n\nHow do you infuse creativity into your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Watching TikTok videos inspires me to keep going and encourages me to do more at work. When you see the policies you create getting executed and doing what they\u2019ve been designed to do, it inspires a level of creativity within you.\n\nWhy is product policy important to the creative tech industry in Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nPearl\u00e9: For us, as product policy managers, we are at the centre of every company. People like me are responsible for seeing all sides to the story. Yes, we see the creative side of things, but we also have to consider safety and security. Big tech companies still have a long way to go where product policy is concerned. Our ecosystem is very funding and investment-focused \u2013 which I understand because capital is essential \u2013 but policy and security are equally important.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFatura\u2019s latest funding round\n\nEthio Telecom\u2019s 40% stake sale\n\nYouTube\u2019s latest ad ban\n\nEgypt-based Fatura raises $3m pre-series A\n\nFatura Co-founders. Source:MENAbytes\n\nEgypt-based Business to Business (B2B) e-commerce platform, Fatura, announced a $3 million pre-series A round on Monday, June 14, 2021. Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital led the round.\n\nOther investors in the round include Egypt Ventures, The Cairo Angels, Saudi Arabia-based VC, Khwarizmi Ventures, and fintech-focused accelerator, EFG-EV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, a pre-series A round is fundraising done by a startup in the interim between the seed round and the series A round. In July 2020, the startup raised an undisclosed seed round, and this is their second funding round since then.\n\nFatura is a platform that sells grocery inventories to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retailers via a mobile application. With a network that connects manufacturers with wholesalers, the startup can meet those inventory needs. On the app, sellers can manage their pricing lists, manage stocks, and receive orders.\n\nThis latest funding will be used to expand to more cities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The startup also plans to go beyond meeting retailers\u2019 need for FMCGs and create additional services like a digital payment platform to foster ease-of-business for retailers.\n\nCo-founded by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, AbdAllah Mohebeldin, and Ahmed Al Bakary \u2014 who joined the team later \u2014 Fatura launched in Cairo, Egypt, in 2020. So far, the startup has 500 sellers, wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers on the marketplace, having provided service to 25,000 retailers across Egypt.\n\nThings have been quite interesting, as the MENA region\u2019s e-commerce sector has experienced steady growth. According to a Bain & Company report, it was worth $8.3 billion as of 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25%, most of which Egypt accounts for.\n\nWith such significant growth, we could witness the rise of more startups with product offerings geared towards boosting Egypt\u2019s e-commerce sector.\n\nEthiopian government to sell 40% stake of Ethio Telecom\n\nThe Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) has launched a tender to aid the partial privatisation of state-owned telecommunication operator, Ethio Telecom. With this in place, interested private investors can apply, and the chosen bidder will own a 40% stake in Ethio Telecom.\n\nProspective investors have to go through a few stages, the first being submitting a special form-like request called Expression of Interest (EOI). Other stages in the process will be revealed later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthiopia is one of the few countries globally to have a monopoly on telecom providers. However, this move is part of plans to open up the country\u2019s largest and most lucrative sector to private investors.\n\nIn February, we reported that Kenyan telecom giant, Safaricom, was one of the final six companies shortlisted for bids on two telecom licences in Ethiopia. And they got it in May, alongside Sumitomo Corporation and the CDC Group.\n\nThis move to sell off a 40% stake to private investors further shows the country\u2019s commitment to encouraging healthy competition in the region, as shielding the sector from competition might slow down innovation.\n\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t be quick to forget Ethiopia\u2019s erratic approach to Internet censorship,\n\nYouTube to ban certain topics from its masthead ad banner\n\nGoogle-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, has made some updates to its masthead ad placement policies.\n\nBeginning from Monday, June 21, 2021, YouTube will not allow ads about alcohol sale, gambling, prescription drugs, elections, and politics to run on its homepage \u2014 the platform\u2019s biggest ad unit.\n\nPer Axios, this move is a part of Google\u2019s commitment to \u201cminimize confusion, misinformation and manipulation, especially surrounding sensitive events.\u201d\n\nOne might wonder if YouTube isn\u2019t too late to the party, as giant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have since placed bans on ads related to political topics. This story gives further context to how these bans took effect during Nigeria\u2019s general elections in 2019.\n\nYou might want to make some excuses for YouTube. Perhaps, the platform wasn\u2019t as strongly exploited as Facebook and Twitter, so the need for permanent restriction measures didn\u2019t arise. However, they placed a temporary ban on political ads following the January 6 Capitol Insurrection.\n\nBut then, the best-performing videos on YouTube are usually longer than 10 minutes, enough time to capture nuance and context that Twitter and Facebook inherently can\u2019t.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa.

          "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a medical expert to know the value of blood to humans. At a basic level, most people understand that the absence of blood in a human is fatal, yet blood donation rates in most African countries are low.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 112.5 million blood donations are collected worldwide. Still, more than half of this number is gathered in high-income countries \u2014 home to only 19% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nWorryingly, the United Nations estimates that more than 536,000 women die during childbirth, with 99% of them living in developing countries. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of deaths, responsible for 40% of maternal deaths in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBlood donation and supply remain major challenges in Africa as health officials battle logistical problems and cultural barriers. Consequently, family and friends donate most of the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood. Worse still, they may not be matching blood donors.\n\nSolving Africa\u2019s blood donation problem requires more than calling for voluntary donors. In most places, officials have to contend with superstitions or cultural limitations that make people unwilling to donate.\n\nAlso, the infrastructure needed to transport the blood is often absent in most parts of the continent. With Africa\u2019s infrastructure challenges, it is difficult to say how many lives have been lost because they lacked access to blood.\n\nWHO advises that most of the blood donated come from voluntary donors, but that is not the case in all countries, especially in developing ones.\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Coordinator of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), Dr Omale Amedu, revealed that only 5% of the blood collected in the country were from voluntary donors, with the remaining 95% commercially provided.\n\nMost African countries can\u2019t meet their annual blood requirements and increase millions of women, children, and accident victims\u2019 risk of mortality (ROM). In 2016, WHO estimated that Africa only covered 50% of its blood requirements.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, reports that the country needs 2 million units of blood annually but only collects 60,000 units. Cameroon, on the other hand, needs about 400,000 units of blood but collects only 90,000 units. The trend of supply failing to meet demand is common across Africa.\n\nThe startups below are using technology to solve the problems blood banks and hospitals face and close the gap between supply and demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifebank\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun founded Lifebank in 2016. After suffering complications during pregnancy and needing a blood transfusion in the United States, she began to think of the millions of women back in Nigeria who could have lost their lives if they had been in her shoes.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with CNN, the entrepreneur said, \u201cI realised after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum haemorrhage. The most important thing you can do when a mum is haemorrhaging is replacing the blood she has lost, even if you can\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThis epiphany was all she needed to start Lifebank to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly served over 500 hospitals while maintaining a presence in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nIt has also expanded its operations from moving only blood to other medical supplies like oxygen and blood products.\n\nThe startup has gained global recognition, with Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on the startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing [Lifebank] that needs to exist. If she can actually pull it off, she\u2019ll show a model that will impact not just Lagos, not just Nigeria, but countries all around the world.\u201d\n\nInfiuss\n\nWhile Cameroonian entrepreneur, Melissa Jane Bime, was in nursing school, a young girl at the hospital where she worked who had come down with malaria could not get a blood transfusion. She died as a result. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018. It multiplies very quickly, causing serious blood loss.\n\nBime would later ascertain that a hospital 20 minutes away had the right blood all along. That was all the motivation she needed.\n\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank. The startup is the recipient of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award and was the grand prize winner of the 2018 Anzisha Prize.\n\nDamu-Sasa\n\nAfter Nairobi\u2019s Westgate terror attack in 2013, the government appealed for blood donations to save survivors. And thousands of Kenyans turned up, but there was a problem. Although many people around the country were willing to donate, logistical challenges meant that only those in Nairobi could.\n\nThis led Francis Kilemi and Aaron Ogunde to create a solution that leverages technology to solve the problems of sourcing and donating blood.\n\nWith help from Kenya\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Authority, the startup piloted the project in Kenyatta Hospital in 2017. Since then, their reach has spread to over 100 hospitals across Kenya.\n\nDamu-Sasa is a Kenyan healthtech startup that works across the blood ecosystem. It connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\n\nRedbank\n\nRedbank homepage\n\nFounded in 2014 by Francis Adereti, Toluwanimi Adeyanju, and Tunde Ojediran, Redbank functions quite similarly to Lifebank.\n\nHowever, in addition to a mobile app, blood requests can be made via SMS and voice calls. The startup matches received requests with the appropriate blood banks. And according to the company, people can expect responses within 30 seconds of making their requests.\n\nUnlike other startups in the space, Redbank does not handle deliveries. It only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\n\nThe startup has increased its reach by striking partnerships with the Nigerian Red Cross Society and the Blood Bank Society of Nigeria.\n\nHaima Health Initiative\n\nHaima Health Initiative homepage\n\nBukola Bolarinwa is a lawyer and a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Young Leader Award. As a child, her parents often told her there were things she could not do. But it was not until she was older she learnt why \u2014 she had sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile in law school, she became friends with Nkechi Azinge, who would go on to found the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF). During this time, Bolarinwa volunteered at hospitals and discovered that sickle cell patients frequently needed blood transfusions.\n\nHowever, the hospitals often lacked sufficient blood. This led her to start Haima Health Initiative, which has evolved into an online voluntary blood donor register. It organises blood drives and educates people on the benefits of blood donation.\n\nWhile these startups are doing their part in ensuring that blood and blood products are available to those who need them, the success of their efforts depends on regular voluntary donors. According to WHO, 90% of people eligible to donate blood aren\u2019t doing so.\n\nResearch shows that one donated unit of blood can save up to three lives. We can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.\n\nHappy World Blood Donor Day.",

This is imperative because access to blood and blood components is an essential service that must be guaranteed if we are to make progress toward universal access to health and universal health coverage.\u201d\n\nHe however reassured that ongoing reforms in the Edo health sector, through the Edo Health Improvement Programme (Edo-HIP), would provide mechanisms to ensure patients in rural areas have access to safe blood.\n\nAccording to the WHO, \u201cWorld Blood Donor Day aims to raise global awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to national health systems.\n\n\u201cSafe blood and blood products and their transfusion are a critical aspect of care and public health. They save millions of lives and improve the health and quality of life of many patients every day. The need for blood is universal, but access to blood for all those who need it is not. Blood shortages are particularly acute in developing countries.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that everyone who needs safe blood has access to it, all countries need voluntary, unpaid donors who give blood regularly.

          "title": "10 things to know about the #June12Protest",
          "text": "Nigerians took to the street last Saturday in peaceful rallies to protest against bad governance and insecurity across the country.\n\nThe protest, organised by some Nigerian youth and civil society organisations, was billed to hold simultaneously in various states across the federation.\n\nThe protest held in many parts of the country including Abuja, Lagos, Oyo, Ondo Osun and Ogun, to mention but a few. The protest, however, did not hold in most parts of the North.\n\nThe June 12 protest, deliberately planned by civic groups and activists to coincide with Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, aimed at pressuring the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to address the worsening state of governance and the alarming rate of insecurity in the country.\n\nJune 12 is celebrated as Democracy Day in Nigeria in remembrance of the June 12, 1993, presidential election that was presumably won by, Moshood Abiola.\n\nThe election, said to be the fairest and freest in Nigeria, was annulled under controversial circumstances by the military regime of Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nMr Abiola later died under controversial circumstances in detention in 1998 after he was arrested by the military regime for declaring himself president of Nigeria.\n\nThe federal government and the authorities in various states had indicated their disapproval of the protest.\n\nHowever, a counter-protesting group emerged in Abuja, protesting in solidarity with the president.\n\nCivic groups, including the #RevolutionNow movement, led by Sahara Reporters publisher, Omoyele Sowore, were prevented from protesting in Abuja and Lagos.\n\nWhile the right to peaceful assembly is a fundamental human right, the Nigerian government, under Mr Buhari, has the reputation of cracking down on such gatherings deemed confrontational by state officials.\n\nHere are 10 things we learnt from the protest:\n\nHiring of pro-government protesters\n\nIn a desperate move to overshadow the mainstream protests, hundreds of protesters wearing branded T-shirts with pro-Buhari inscriptions also trooped to the streets of Abuja on Saturday.\n\nMost of them were recruited to join a rally aimed at countering the mainstream June 12 protests on Saturday.\n\nSome of them, who randomly spoke to PREMIUM TIMES at Unity Fountain, Abuja, said they were promised to be paid between N1,500 and N2,500 to attend the counter-protest.\n\nMilitarisation to prevent protest\n\nThere was a heavy police presence in the country\u2019s two major cities, in order to prevent citizens from protesting.\n\nAbuja and Lagos saw police shooting their guns into the air and firing teargas into the crowds to disperse the demonstrators, who held placards and chanted \u201cBuhari must go\u201d.\n\nPolice fired teargas and detained several demonstrators in the two major cities. Officers were also seen smashing mobile phones confiscated from protesters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo protests in the North\n\nThe widely publicised protest failed to hold in most of Nigeria\u2019s 19 northern states.\n\nAside from Plateau State and the FCT in North-central Nigeria, protests did not hold in all the entire 18 other states.\n\nInstead of protests, official ceremonies and political rallies organised by some governors to commemorate the June 12 Democracy Day took the centre stage in most of the states, with citizens in most of the states in the northern region going about their routine business.\n\nSocial media mobilisation\n\nOne of the core components of the protests has been the seamless transition between online and offline campaigns.\n\nMainly using the outlawed Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook, young people have rallied and mobilised waves of protests to locations across the country with pretty simple formulas.\n\nFor instance, when dozens of people converge on a location to host their own protests, they share their location on social media asking for \u201creinforcements\u201d, a move that has seen crowds go from a few dozens to hundreds within hours in some places.\n\nStrategic locations were pre-identified online with people encouraged to come out and protest.\n\nProtests abroad\n\nAside from the protests held in Nigeria, different groups held another at the Trafalgar Square in London demanding that \u2018Buhari must go\u2019 and calling for Biafra and a Yoruba nation.\n\nSome others staged a peaceful solidarity protest in Washington D.C. to demand an end to insecurity and bad governance in Nigeria. The protests held across many cities in the country.\n\nThe protesters who wore branded T-shirts with the inscription \u201cYoruba Nation Now!\u201d held placards showing pictures of some of the victims of recent killings by armed bandits in the country.\n\nNo death recorded\n\nDespite the harassment, shootings and intimidation by the police and DSS, no cases of death were recorded across the country.\n\nAccording to some of the protesters, the only mission of the security agents was to thwart the protest.\n\nSources said commissioners of police in various states were warned not to shoot at any protesters to avoid escalating violence.\n\nArrested protesters released within hours\n\nDue to the militarisation of the protest, many protesters were arrested and detained briefly by the police.\n\nSome of the arrested protesters were manhandled and subjected to inhuman environments.\n\nHowever, despite all the odds, no protester was detained for up to 24 hours as all the detainees were released within hours.\n\nWell-coordinated pro-government protest\n\nThe counter-protest organised by agents of government was well-coordinated, with the organisers operating from the field.\n\nThe organisers were seen delegating various protesters to speak to journalists and also telling them what to say.\n\nMost of the organisers who look older physically declined speaking to the media as they claim their delegates were in charge of the protest.\n\nFree use of unity fountain\n\nWhile the anti-government protesters were denied access to the Abuja unity fountain, pro-government protesters operated freely at the fountain.\n\nThey spent several hours while the security agents looked by, forcing the anti-government protesters to find an alternative venue.\n\nPolice protection\n\nWhile anti-government protesters were bullied and harassed by security agents, pro-government protesters were given police protection.\n\nThe police moved along with them to wherever they were going within the unity fountain axis.\n\nDue to harassment and intimidation, anti-government protesters were forced to end their protest abruptly.",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has launched the Dash Me Store, an outfit of the Dash Me Foundation founded by the immediate past Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun.\n\nThe store is established to mobilise resources for onward distribution to vulnerable people in the society via grassroots charities.\n\nThe Vice President during the opening on Sunday said, \u201cI am excited to be here for several reasons, but most of all because of Mrs Adeosun\u2019s commitment to the notion that all service to man is actually service to God, and she took that very seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as Minister, she prioritized the Social Investment Programmes, when for the first time, the country voted almost N500B of our annual budget to welfare programmes which are called the Social Investment Programmes, which involved engaging 500,000 young men and women and also giving microcredit to about 2 million traders and also a home-grown school feeding programme for 9.5 million children daily in public schools across the country.\n\n\u201cI am therefore really not surprised that she has decided to use some of her enormous talent and influence to establish an organization that raises funds and provides resources for indigenous grassroots charities working with orphaned and vulnerable children, disadvantaged youth, and victims of domestic violence,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the establishment of Nigeria\u2019s first thrift-for-charity online store, Prof. Osinbajo said adding social enterprise to philanthropy with a structure that allows for resource mobilization for charity as well as creates the opportunity for people to earn a living in the process, should be the way to go.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is happening here is that philanthropy is not like it used to be when all you needed was a good and kind heart and you didn\u2019t need to plan or organize as you would a business for-profit\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, one of the factors responsible for the impactful implementation of the Social Investment Programmes of the Buhari administration over the years is the realization that \u201cyou can\u2019t reach Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d.\n\nHe said the realization has influenced the structure designed for the SIP and is largely responsible for the successes of the programme (which is now regarded as one of the biggest social welfare schemes in the continent).\n\n\u201cWhat Kemi and her team have done is to bring the new notion of social enterprise to this project. Philanthropy run with the discipline, attention to detail, and financial prudence of a successful business, and she can do all of that, and I am sure her team is imbibing that, given her background in finance in both the private and public sector.\n\n\u201cThe idea of this thrift-for-charity store is brilliant and the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a unique model which does not just give to the needy in the conventional way of merely handing out donations.\n\n\u201cIt is an innovative and structured way of aggregating donations to earn income to transform the lives of the vulnerable and needy while creating jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cI must say that your focus on funding grassroots charities is so crucial and I know that, having campaigned with you on behalf of our party, the APC all around Ogun and in every part of Nigeria, it is clear that you can\u2019t reach Nigeria and Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d, Osinbajo added.\n\nIn her response, the former Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun said the idea of the store is to aggregate donations of different kinds for charitable causes, noting that Nigerians from different fields of endeavour and from across the country would be enabled via the online store to contribute to supporting the needy in the society.\n\nShe said the organisation would work closely with charitable organisations in the grassroots to ensure that funds and other materials donated via the Dash Me Store get to actual beneficiaries",

How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze described the President\u2019s comment as disastrous, noting that \u2018no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo\u2019.\n\nThe group stated that the silence of Northern leaders is proof that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria.\n\nIsiguzoro noted that Igbo people are emergency experts in all situations and will be a dot in the circle that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide had charged the leadership of the North to speak out against discrimination against Igbos and divisiveness being created by disastrous declarations of President Muhammadu Buhari describing how the southeast is landlocked and no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIt appears that there are chains of crafted skirmish programmed to either aggravate the traumas of Ndigbo or remind them of the sordid past a few years ago, and with \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 slogan that was used to pulverize Igbos during the Biafra war that left 3 million people dead, especially women and children. Right now in 160 days, 513 Igbos had been killed, 2,436 arrested and 854 missing in the ongoing \u2018imported\u2019 insecurity challenges in the southeast.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018dot in the circle\u2019 is a new signal to point out that Ndigbo are surrounded or should be taught in the language they should understand, but the fact remains that, the silence of Northern leaders shows that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria. We have seen the direction of events and Igbos are not noisy anymore, we are emergency experts in all situations, \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 remains the Bermuda triangular point that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some residents of Umuahia, Abia State and Owerri, Imo State, have told our correspondents that Nigerian soldiers now routinely arrest people, brand them members of IPOB, kill them and take their corpse away.\n\nAn Umuahia resident who did not want his name in print, narrated how soldiers intercepted a bus load of traders travelling from the Abia State capital last week, and killed all occupants of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cLast week, the Army stopped a bus carrying traders from Umuahia. They arrested all the occupants of the vehicle and wasted them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey arrest people, mostly young men everywhere and kill them. If they see a group of young men talking, they will arrest all of them.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, Imo State capital, the story in the same. Residents say people are still being arrested and taken away.\n\n\u201cThey (security agents) are still arresting people here and there,\u201d a resident told our correspondent on Monday. \u201cPeople are afraid to go out. The whole place is scary.\u201d",

Consequently, the Twitter ban will likely impact negatively and disrupt businesses especially Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises who rely on social media, such as Facebook, Instagram including Twitter to conduct business.\n\n\u201cIt will therefore most likely negatively impact the IT sector of the economy which is already facing several other challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be considered that there are alternative social media platforms, the abrupt nature of the suspension would mean a loss of existing contacts and a cost of migration.\n\n\u201cWe must of course also not and cannot, discountenance the national security dimension of the misuse of social media and micro-blogging platforms to inspire violence outside its use to conduct Business.\u201d\n\nTwitter had reached out to the government that it was ready to meet for an open discussion to address mutual concerns and see the service restored. The company revealed this in a tweet.\n\nThe company had said, \u201cToday marks one week since Twitter was blocked in Nigeria. We have informed the Nigerian government that we are ready to meet for an open discussion to address mutual concerns and see the service restored.\n\n\u201cWe remain advocates for the free and Open Internet everywhere.\u201d\n\nMercy Omohoro, a Twitter user who also sells on the app, said, \u201cHonestly, it has always been twitter.

          "title": "Bitcoin wallets with at least 1 BTC account for 5% of the whole market \u2014 Daily Times Nigeria",
          "text": "The bitcoins market has shown positive trends towards growth as the number of people who are willing to invest in it is increasing rapidly. The growing popularity of cryptos is likely to have something to do with the trend of creating a national bank for digital currencies. More and more people are attempting to figure out what digital currencies are and how they function, not that the topic has been widely discussed. As a result, more bitcoin wallets are being developed every day, and the entire industry is growing as a result.\n\nMost of the time, these wallets with at least 1 BTC are on their way to be successful, as was reported by Bitcoin Magazine. According to that analysis, the number of entire coiner bitcoin wallets that store at least 1 BTC has increased year after year, while the remaining addresses account for only 5% of Bitcoin\u2019s market value.\n\nWhy hold 1 BTC\n\nDespite the fact that the total number of bitcoin wallets is growing on a daily basis, these wallets are not particularly wealthy in digital currency, for reasons that are easy to deduce. First and foremost, most consumers are unaware of how Bitcoin wallets work. The majority of Bitcoin consumers have no idea how these wallets function in real life. All it proves is that BTC is not what everyone believes it to be.\n\nThere are not many people that hold more than one bitcoin in their waller. It is simply improbable. Everyone knows that the price of bitcoin changes a lot and some individuals cannot afford to buy more than 1 BTC at a time. They are also concerned about safety, as bitcoin is not a real asset, and new clients may be unsure whether or not this digital currency would allow them safely trade money.\n\nBTC and Traditional Finance\n\nAs a result, bitcoin\u2019s integration into the existing financial system is exceedingly improbable. Although several nations are beginning to incorporate the NBDC into their financial systems, bitcoin is different since it is not regulated by the government or any sort of authorities, which makes it less safe.\n\nWhen you consider that most crypto firms still prefer to accept fiat currency for every service they provide rather than crypto payments, it is easy to imagine that it will not be completely adopted anytime soon. There have been rumors that crypto may join the FX sector, although this is exceedingly improbable. However, after the implementation of cryptos in the forex industry, there will be some attraction factors that the brokerage companies can offer to their clients, for example, instead of XM no deposit bonus, they will have the opportunity to offer the bitcoin no deposit bonus, that most likely will increase the client involvement. On the other hand, one of the reasons why people are hesitant to enter the forex market is because of the rules. They will have to wait for even longer to reach their aims and prosper if they obtain an official license from cryptos because authorities often take a long time to regulate the crypto industry.\n\nThe amount of BTC wallets\n\nDespite the fact that the price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed, according to the most recent Bitcoin data, the number of addresses of wholecoiner clients has climbed dramatically since 2009. Wholecoiner is a word used to describe who has a whole bitcoin in their e-wallet, and those whose wallets contain at least 1 BTC currently account for 95% of the whole crypto capital market, leaving just 5% distributed among the tens of millions of Bitcoin users who have a balance below 1 BTC. Over 800 000 wholesalers already hold 1 BTC or more, according to the data. Individuals who have several wallets and access to wallets with lesser amounts are most likely among them.\n\nHowever, as financial experts point out, consumers might go bankrupt if they do not understand how digital wallets function. As a result, before investing in Bitcoin, you should be aware that a Bitcoin wallet is a digital storage device that facilitates bitcoin transactions. The primary foal of this technology is to execute secure transactions which is why bitcoin wallets employ encrypted protocols. These wallets may be accessed through a variety of platforms, including web browsers, mobile apps, and desktop software packages.\n\nAccording to current figures, wholesalers control roughly $301 billion in bitcoin, with a less-than-whole that can be valued at $16 billion. It is worth noting that these wholesalers account for only 0.47 % of balance-bearing bitcoin wallets. Currently, just around 1% of the world\u2019s population owns this asset, but it is increasing at such a quick rate that it has the potential to quadruple in the near future.\n\nThe halving of bitcoin is a crucial step for traders. It is the word for how many coins BTC miners get for uploading new transactions to the blockchain. Halvings limit the network\u2019s ability to issue new BTCs, reducing the supply of the new bitcoin and potentially driving up prices. However, Bitcoin\u2019s trend of gaining more and more consumers will almost certainly continue and the number of individuals who sign bitcoin wallets will be substantially bigger in only a few years.",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: How President Buhari lied to Nigerians during Arise TV interview",
          "text": "One thing President Muhammadu Buhari is notorious for is his failure to grant interviews. When Nigerians are not addressed by Femi Adesina, his second in command, Garba Shehu always have the centre stage.\n\nWhen the matters to be addressed are hightly controversial, the minister of information and culture, Lai Mohammed takes the lead. These trio are the mouthpiece of President Buhari.\n\nNEWS DIRECT understands that on several occasions, Nigerians have had the need to wonder whether the president is aware of the ills and odds in the land.\n\nThe only time Mr Buhari speaks to the nation are on significant days such as Independence Day, New Year Day and Democracy Day among others.\n\nLike the rainbow, President Buhari made a rare media appearance last week but did not shine like the rainbow does. Despite the fact that last Thursday interview with Arise Television was not live, the number citizen of Nigeria still goofed.\n\nHe repeated his old lies on the successes of his administration in last six years. On his failures, Mr Buhari blamed the PDP\u2019s 16-year-rule for the decadence in the nation.\n\nSpeaking further, Mr Buhari said \u201cI would like you to check how much we are earning from 1999 to 2014. From 1999 to 2014, our production (if you check you will find out that) every production was 2.1 million barrels per day. At the cost of 100 American dollars per barrel. So, from 1999 to 2014, we were earning 2.1 million times 100 dollar per day,\u201d he told the Arise Television crew on Thursday.\n\nBut that is a big lie.\n\nFrom records of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as quoted by Statista, in 1999, the average annual price of crude oil was about $17.4 per barrel. It was $27.6 in 2000, $23.1 in 2001, $24.3 in 2002, $28.1 in 2003 and in 2004, it was $36.5. Oil sold for $50.5 per barrel in 2005, $61 in 2006, $69 in 2007, $94.1 in 2008, $60.8 in 2009 and in 2010, oil price was $77.3.\n\nIn 2011, the average annual price of oil had gotten to a record high of $107 per barrel, increasing to $109 per barrel in 2012, $105.8 in 2013 and $96.2 in 2014.\n\nThe average oil price between 1999 and 2014 is $61.7 per barrel.\n\nThis data is a far cry from an average of $100 per barrel President Buhari had claimed in his interview.\n\nNEWS DIRECT on Tuesday reached out to presidential spokespersons, Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu but they did not respond to calls and texts sent to their phones seeking their comments for this report.",

          "text": "Some five months after, reprieve has come the way of Abubakar Garba Idris, a senior protection assistant with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and some nine others, as they were released by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nAlso released alongside Alooma, as the UN staff is fondly called, were a businessman, Muazu Bawa, a senior Christian cleric, Reverend Zango and one Barka Wasinda, a former staff of the Nigerian Ports Authority and some aid workers abducted March from a facility in Dikwa.\n\nDikwa, which lies some 90 kilometres away from Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, had consistently come under attacks by the insurgents from January till date.\n\nAlooma and some of the captives were abducted several times between January 2 and March along Maiduguri/Damaturu highway.\n\nBlueprint gathered that they all regained their freedom after series of negotiations.\n\nThe UN staffer was as at the time of this report, undergoing medical and military check with troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Maiduguri after which he would be released to his family.\n\nSimilarly, Bawa, a business mogul, who was also kidnapped same day, as well as the other eight captives were all undergoing debriefing by the military.\n\nThe attacks\n\nFor instance, during the March attack, the terror group overran the town, destroyed support facilities, including a primary healthcare centre, and also laid siege to the UN humanitarian hub, which forced aid workers to seek shelter in a bunker.\n\nThe development forced the world body to suspend operations in the war ravaged northeast in response to the attacks on humanitarian operations in Dikwa and Damasak.\n\nThe council on foreign relations\u2019 security tracker says over 37,000 people were killed and millions displaced by the Boko Haram conflict.\n\nThe insurgents, it would be recalled, had attacked a convoy of travellers close to Matari village between Mainok to Jakana along Maiduguri/Damaturu highway, during which the UN worker was kidnapped at about 8.30am of the ill-fated day.\n\nAccording to reports, the criminals who were all in military attire mounted a roadblock on the highway with about three Hilux vans and several motorcycles to force to a halt.\n\nHowever, Alooma drew the ire of the insurgents when he threw off his identification card in an attempt to possibly conceal his identity from his abductors.\n\nUnfortunately, according to report, he was sighted by one of the insurgents who ordered him out of the car.\n\nAnd for Bawa, Blueprint learnt the businessman was driving his private vehicle and attempted to beat the checkpoint of the insurgents.\n\nIn the process, his car was shot at the rear by the Boko Haram elements, who in anger pounced on him and took the businessman to an unknown destination.\n\nConfirming their release, Executive Director Yobe State Network of Civil Society Abubakar Baba Shehu said \u201cit\u2019s cheering news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was together with someone who called a family member of Alooma and he has confirmed the release of his brother. This is encouraging news and we pray that more captives should be released soon,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nPlateau\n\nAnd from Plateau state, there are reports that 14 people were confirmed dead in two separate attacks by gunmen.\n\nBlueprint gathered that while 12 people were killed in Sabon Layi Village, Kuru community, Jos South local government area, two other persons were killed in Zogu Village, Miango community in Bassa local government area of the state.\n\nSources said the attacks were carried out Sunday night while the people were already in their sleep.\n\nConfirming the development, the lawmaker representing Jos South local government area in the State House of Assembly, Fom Gwattson, said: \u201cSome gunmen last night attacked my constituency and killed twelve persons in Sabon Layi community. I have just been informed of the development and this is completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNational President Irigwe Development Association Ezekiel Bini, who also spoke in similar vein, said two persons were killed in Zogu village, while two others were injured during the incident.\n\n\u201cTwo persons died during the attack last night, while two were injured. It\u2019s unfortunate that we have continued to bury our people on every attack by gunmen without anything being done to stop the killings by the authorities,\u201d Bini lamented.\n\nPolice confirm killings\n\nBut in a reaction, the police image maker in the state, Ubah Ogaba, put the casualty figures at 10 on Jos South local government area.\n\n\u201cWe had an incident in Jos South LGA. 10 persons, unfortunately, lost their lives but I am yet to get reports on the attack in Bassa.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State Police Command received a report that 10 persons were shot dead in a drinking joint at Sabon Layi, Kuru in Jos South LGA by yet to be identified gunmen who drove in with a Hilux and shot sporadically.\n\n\u201cPersonnel of the Command and the military have been deployed in the affected area.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police has ordered an immediate investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the killing and to bring the perpetrators of that dastardly act to book,\u201d Ogaba said.\n\n11 killed in Benue\n\nIn a related development, 11 people were killed in two separate incidents in Agatu local government area of Benue state.\n\nThe incident came barely one week after gunmen attacked and killed 27 people in Odugbeho community of the same local government area.\n\nIt was gathered that the latest killings occurred in Odugbeho and two other rural villages of Aila and Adagbo.\n\nSources said while two people were killed in Odugbeho, the nine others met their fate in Aila and Adagbo villages Sunday night.\n\nConfirming the development, chairman of the council, Adoyi Sule, said the attack on Odugbeho community was done by some suspected herdsmen.\n\nThe council boss further said the suspects invaded the community Sunday night, killed the two people and burnt 21 houses.\n\nSimilarly, he said the death of nine others were occasioned by the communal crisis between Aila and Adagbo communities.\n\nHe said about eight persons wounded during the fracas were currently receiving medical attention at an unknown hospital.\n\nAnd when contacted, spokesman of the state Police command, Catherine Anene, said she was yet to be briefed.\n\nZazzau emir\n\nAlso, the Emir of Zazzau,n Mallam Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli has raised the alarm over persistent level of attacks carried out by armed bandits in the Emirate and the state as a whole.\n\nHe therefore called for more deployment of troops to enhance maximum security of lives and property of citizens in the area.\n\nThe Emir raised the concern Monday when the Kaduna state Commissioner of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Samuel Aruwan, led a security delegation on a confidence building visit to the palace in Zaria.\n\nThe monarch said the increasing rate of banditry in the emirate and the state in general was becoming so alarming with gunmen striking in the ancient city almost on daily basis in the last one week.\n\nBamali said: \u201cIt is disheartening that a hospital can be razed and a Medical Doctor kidnapped, while a District Head who is leader can be subjected to attacks and his family kidnapped.\n\n\u201cYou are also aware that a student was shot death while two lecturers and about 10 students were kidnapped in Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic Zaria all within one week.\u201d\n\nThe Emir said more deployment of troops became highly imperative considering the strategic importance of Zaria which serves as a gateway to people in the North West.\n\nBamalli however appreciated the efforts of both the federal and Kaduna state governments at combating the menace, but called for more stringent measures to safeguard the lives of the people.\n\n\u201cWith all the number of Military, Air Force and Police Formations in the state,it is worrisome that such level of insecurity could persist. I therefore appealed for more concerted efforts in addressing the ugly trend,\u201d the emir pleaded.\n\nEarlier, Commissioner Aruwan had said they were at the palace to commiserate with the Emir over recent activities of gunmen in the Emirate and also reassure the people that government and all security personnel would continue to protect the lives and property of the citizens.\n\nHe conveyed Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai\u2019s condolence and sympathy to all those involved in the attacks.\n\nOn the visit were Commander 453 Base Services Group Nigerian Air Force Training Command Kaduna, Air Commodore Kenneth Iyamu, Garrison Commander 1 Division, Kaduna, Brig.-Gen. Ofuno and Commissioner of Police Umar Musa Muri, who all pledged their readiness to tackle insecurity challenges head on.\n\n\u2018We need security summit now\u2019\n\nAnd amidst these challenges, pioneer Director General Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Osaro Onaiwu has urged former governors from 1999 to 2019 to converge as soon as possible to deliberate on issues bordering on national security.\n\nHe charged the former governors to speak up against the insecurity and other vices ravaging the country, as keeping quiet in the face of killing and destructions would not help the country and its citizens.\n\nThe former NGF head further noted that none of the ex-governors had raised his voice against the killings and carnage in the country in the past few years.\n\nHe said \u201crain doesn\u2019t fall on one roof,\u201d insisting that the earlier the insecurity ravaging the nation is tamed the better for everyone.\n\nOnaiwu pointed out that nowhere is safe in the country, adding that \u201cthe nation is not at war, but the blood that has been spilled in the past few years could be counted as a nation at war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe former governors should meet like other leaders of thought that have been working round the clock to proffer solution to what is happening in the country.\n\n\u201cKeeping silence will not help the nation as there is nowhere that is safe presently. This is the time for them to meet and take action. Religion, ethnicity and other cultural affiliation should be put aside so that this country can be delivered from the hands of bandits, terrorists, kidnappers, robbers and others destroying the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is high time somebody speaks out and the former governors still have influence in this country and they should not keep quiet. Keeping quiet will not help the country to overcome the monster of insecurity and other vices,\u201d Onaiwu said.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have accused the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of not making its statutory contributions to the Federation Allocation Account (FAAC) thereby starving the states and local governments and indeed Nigerians of funds.\n\nThis was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued Monday at the end of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum meeting held in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state.\n\nThe PDP Governors\u2019 Forum also admonished other agencies of government such as the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) and the Department of Customs & Excise to up their contributions to the Federation Allocation Account.\n\nChairman of the forum and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal made the positions known at the end of the meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Forum examined the operations of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and expressed alarm at the opaque manner it carries out its operations. It decried the recent NNPC\u2019s decision not to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, thereby starving the States and Local Governments and indeed Nigerians of funds needed for employment, development and general wellbeing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting emphasised that under the Constitution, the NNPC is duty-bound to make proceeds of sale or business of petroleum available to the Federation Allocation Account which belongs to the three tiers of government, excluding reasonable and verified and verifiable cost of operations. The federal government through the NNPC is a manager of our oil wealth merely as trustee for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe meeting frowned at a situation where the NNPC decides in a totally discretionary and often whimsical manner, how much to spend, how to spend it and how much to remit to the Federation Account, contrary to the letters and even the spirit of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further said: \u201cThe PDP Governors also expressed deep concerns on the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It viewed with regrets that the CBN is operating as an independent government within a Government, which is a pervasion of the autonomy of the Bank. A situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a leviathan, but also a father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government.\u201d\n\nThey frowned at the rising and seemingly uncontrollable debt profile of Nigeria with over 80% of normal Appropriation spent on debt servicing, noting that \u201cmoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 Trillion Naira is becoming unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also reiterated its call for the \u201cRevenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission to urgently send the revised Revenue Allocation Formula to Mr President for onward transmission to the National Assembly for enactment, such that more resources are made available to States and Local Governments where ordinary Nigerians reside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting expressed support for the implementation of judicial and legislative autonomy in the Federation and States, in conformity with the extant provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe meeting examined the suspension of Twitter from operating in Nigeria and condemned the personalised reasons given for the action. The mere ego of Mr President is not enough for such a drastic action that deprives millions of Nigerians from such an affordable means of expression and communication. We hope that this is not a harbinger or early warning signs of descent into dictatorship.\n\n\u201cThis will further worsen Nigeria\u2019s 33% unemployment rate which is the highest in the world, improve Nigerias ranking as the country with second highest poverty rate in the entire world, all of which happened under APC\u2019s unfortunate stewardship.\n\n\u201cThe meeting consequently requested Mr. President to review the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria in the national interest,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 further stated.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were Governors Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia state) who is the vice chairman, Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Douye Diri (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde (Oyo), Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri (Adamawa), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Darius Ishaku (Taraba) and Deputy Governor Mahdi Mohammed of Zamfara state.",

He did not demand the constitution and inauguration of A BOARD of NDDC.\n\n\u201cThis simply means that he was specifically referring to the Board of NDDC already screened and confirmed by the Senate in line with the NDDC 2000 Act, as amended, but whose members have been unjustly placed on standby under the guise of allowing for forensic auditing of NDDC.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we are once more patriotically renewing our Advice to President Buhari to be very wary of those Governors, and some of his political Associates/Aides misleading him and putting pressure on him to continue to unjustly and unlawfully delay or jettison the inauguration of the Governing Board of NDDC that he rightly nominated and passionately requested the Senate to confirm, which the Senate did.\n\n\u201cAs we stated in our previous Advice to him, those Governors and Politicians who went pleading with him not to inaugurate the NDDC Board were not sincere to him and his APC but only wanted to pitch our people against him and his APC leadership. Have we not been vindicated now?\n\n\u201cIt will be against his commitment to restoring Peace, Order and Security in our Oil Producing South-South Region if he allows himself to be misled to further delay the inauguration of this substantive Board of NDDC. Nigerians can\u2019t afford to see our South-South Region added to the Regions that are sadly now engulfed in breakdown of Peace, Security and Public Order.\n\n\u201cAs High Chief Tompolo rightly stated in his Statement, the renewed demand for the inauguration of the substantive Board of NDDC is for the Love of our Region and Country, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer allow the guise of forensic auditing to be used to mislead President Buhari on this matter,\u201d it stated.",

          "title": "Re: 1,500 Christian Killed in 6 Months in Nigeria -NigPilot",
          "text": "While taking a vivid look at the article being published on the spiteful statements made by the immediate past United States Secretary of State and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, all I saw was nothing but a tool (Pompeo) that is craving for relevance, and being used by the news agency to propagate pernicious propaganda aimed at the heart of Nigeria\u2019s unity by creating extreme religious bigotry among the peaceful citizens, and to also disrupt President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nThe article written by Mike Pompeo on the 10th of June is nothing but a tool aimed at breeding discord and blindly criticizing the patriotic leaders of our dear country Nigeria. It is nothing but false political propaganda created to serve no good deed.\n\nHe stated that at least 1,500 Christians have been killed in Nigeria in the last six months. This is an awful fabrication of facts. Yes, there are several issues of insecurity rocking the nation, but it is not nearly as bad as Mike Pompeo paints it to be. It is shameful for him to have stated such false facts without providing proof or a source of reference.\n\nI was perplexed to my very core when I read what was written in the fallacious article, as it was obvious that Mike Pompeo wished to blindly attack the Nigerian government without cause or reason, and I asked myself, \u201cWHY?\u201d\n\nIt is remarkable to know that the level of insecurity in Nigeria has drastically reduced overtime. The alarming Boko Haram insurgency has been dealt with in a pragmatic approach taken by President Muhammadu Buhari. Many successes have been recorded under his leadership as he has been steadfast in the discharge of his duty and providing aid to civil authority.\n\nThe issue of Muslims fighting Christians is a matter that has been present throughout history from the 7th century. The matter has encouraged a variety of views throughout history, but greeting the matter with the idiosyncrasy of condemning one party over the other is one that breeds hatred and hostility. Owing to the delicate nature of such a matter, it would have been wise for Pompeo to guard his statements regarding the killings of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is on the edge presently, and statements that would further encourage discord and hostility between the two major religions in the country should be avoided.\n\nIt was myopic of Mike Pompeo not to have pointed out the fact that Christians are not the only ones being slaughtered in the country. Several faithful Muslims have also been killed in various parts of the country. It is obvious that his intents are born out of mischief.\n\nHe also failed to point out the fact that these acts were carried out by terrorists and bandits who do not discriminate when they kill. They do not care about what group or religion their victims belong to. They carry out their acts without mercy, no matter who you are.\n\nI strongly admit and concur that any government that cannot discharge this basic obligation of Protecting Lives and Property, losses any iota of legitimacy. President Muhammadu Buhari has been fervent in his handling of security issues in Nigeria that has led to massive killing and wanton destruction of property across the country, and making every region habitable to everyone irrespective of their religious view as opposed to what Pompeo insinuated.\n\nIn addressing the challenge to the survival of religion tolerance in Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari made it pertinent to consider, and also worked on security issues and problems that have affected or capable of affecting the attitude, confidence and cooperation of all groups and segments that make up the Nigerian federation, without leaving out the necessity to explore the gaps and gray areas in the national constitution that are responsible for various religion problems and crises.\n\nHowever, knowing that sensitive issues like that of religion intolerance is a weaponry that has fostered National and International Terrorist attacks on many Nations, Pompeo should have known better to verify every information gotten, or seen on the internet before relying on a creek in-house media as a source of verifiable information. This act makes a man like him reeks of low intelligence.\n\nHe also accused the Nigerian government of \u201cdownplaying the attacks and characterizing them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror.\u201d One can never call a spade a bucket. We have all seen that there is no religious motivation behind the killings in Nigeria. These killings are merely carried out by merciless bandits and terrorists who know nothing about Islam or Christianity.\n\nPompeo cited the case of Leah Sharibu who has remained in captivity in the hands of the Boko Haram sect due to the fact that she refused to convert to Islam. He claimed that the young lady has remained in captivity over three years without consequence. By this, he insinuates that the Nigerian government failed to act merely because she is a Christian who refused to convert to Islam. This is an odoriferous innuendo that Mike Pompeo has so witlessly expressed.\n\nHe also made other claims about the matter, one of which he gave a self-declared statistic stating that Christians murdered in the country had risen to 60 percent in 2020 and was most likely going to get worse in recent times. This he stated without providing concrete evidence to his claim.\n\nWe should educate Pompeo and help his amnesia about his statement on the presence of radical Islamic jihadist groups in northern Nigeria.\n\nFirstly, he should know that radical Islamic jihadist groups are all over the world. Islamic State West Africa Province, ISWAP, is all over African countries and has registered their presence through different attacks. Has he forgotten so soon?\n\nThe memorable 9/11 attack on the twin tower by Alqueada, that was masterminded and executed on American soil?\n\nThe numerous attacks by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, or Daesh, which is detailed as follows:\n\nA car bomb in Iraq that killed 28 Shia pilgrims and injured 60 others as they were returning from Karbala, while in the capital Baghdad a roadside bomb exploded near a minibus, killing four pilgrims and wounding 15.\n\nA suicide bomber exploded targeting civilians in a commercial shop on a busy tourist destination and business center in Turkey, March 2016.\n\nISIL took responsibility for a stabbing that killed a French police officer and his companion in France, June 2016.\n\n29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting inside Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida in United State, June 2016.\n\nBetween November 2 and 3, five were killed in Stadttempel, Vienna, including the perpetrator. The Vienna Police Department confirmed that the attacker was an Islamic State sympathiser, and that the attack was motivated by Islamic extremism. This happened in Austria, November 2020.\n\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant targeted Shia Muslims on 21 January 2021 in a clothing market in Tayaran Square, Baghdad. US, UN, EU and the Pope condemn the attack calling it a senseless act of violence. Iraq, January 2021\n\nAttacks where everywhere \u2013 United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Canada, etc \u2013 which were dated to 2021.\n\nHowever, with the above references and many more, should we now conclude just like Mr Mike, that all these attacks are on Christians, and every President in the attacked country supports religion intolerance?\n\nIt is obvious that Mike Pompeo\u2019s statements were borne out of hatred for the Islamic religion. It is important for him to realize that words are powerful. If he has any problem with the Islamic religion, he should keep it to himself and not sow seeds of discord in other countries. If he has nothing good to say about the country, it will be in his best interest to keep silent on the matter and focus on his own country.\n\nAt the end of his article, Mike Pompeo issued several lame threats to the federal government of the country. He stated that if the Nigerian government failed to carry out swift actions to put an end to the persecution of Christians, there would be consequences in the form of sanctions and increased diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe Buhari-led administration has been working tirelessly to safeguard the lives and properties of all Nigerian citizens no matter the religion you practice. It is an insult on Mike Pompeo\u2019s part to disregard the efforts put in by the current administration and try to create unnecessary agitation in the country.\n\nAt this point, sanctions and diplomatic pressure isn\u2019t what Nigeria needs. What the country needs is support from other countries. Mike Pompeo would do well to call for support in the country rather that criticize its leaders and proclaim unnecessary threats.\n\nPresident Buhari is efficiently leading the fight against insecurity in Nigeria along with the service chiefs and the Nigerian Military. Let us all join hands to support them rather than throw incessant criticisms at them.\n\nAdadu is a student of peace and conflict resolution and wrote from Gwarimpa",

          "text": "Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, says his people have no land to give out for cattle ranching.\n\nGovernor Umahi stated this on Monday evening while appearing as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019.\n\nUmahi said each state in the South-East already has laws banning open grazing and as such, it is way off as he is a servant to his people.\n\n\u201cThis is not about the governors, it is about the people, so, whatever position the people take in this regard, that is what will happen. There is no land in this regard that is not owned by individuals, corporate bodies.\n\n\u201cSo, this is beyond governors and that is the truth. People calling governors are making a very grievous mistake. Even if I say as a governor in South-East, I want people from this village, I want you to donate this land, the question is: will they allow it?\n\n\u201cI have heard about three communal crisis in my state, and it is all about land. There is a place that I am building a medical university and the people of that village, for a project that is almost completed, went and brought it down. They prefer to have their farms than a medical college. So, the land is a different ball game altogether,\u201d Umahi stated when asked whether he would provide land for ranching as a governor.\n\nREAD ALSO: Herders\u2019 Threat: What Is Going On In Nigeria Is Unconstitutional, Clark Tells Buhari\n\nSpeaking further Umahi noted that his people have \u201csaid they have no land for ranching. They put me where I am. If I have one acre of land and I am talking about giving land for ranching, I should be talking about that particular land. I can\u2019t be talking about somebody\u2019s land. Yes, constitutionally, I have control over the land but you have to kill all the people to get the land.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, Southern Governors banned open grazing of cattle across states in the region and urged the President to address Nigerians on the state of the nation.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country to address increasing agitations in different parts of the nation, while restating their commitment to the unity of the country.\n\nIn reaction to the ban, the presidency said the governors failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nSeeking to profer the needed solution, President Muhammadu Buhari in a recent interview stated that the government will return to a practice in which herders will ply designated grazing routes across the country.\n\nThe President said the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has been asked to begin the process to see how these routes can be legally put back to use, a directive which has not gone down with many Nigerians, with some claiming that the insistence on open grazing points to a hidden agenda.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday reacted to the Federal Government\u2019s ban on Twitter lamenting that it will further worsen and increase the unemployment rate in the country.\n\nThe governors disclosed this in a communique jointly issued at end of the meeting held in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.\n\n\u201cThe meeting examined the suspension of Twitter from operating in Nigeria and condemned the personalised reasons given for the action. The mere ego of Mr. President is not enough for such a drastic action that deprives millions of Nigerians of such an affordable means of expression and communication. We hope that this is not a harbinger or early warning signs of descent into dictatorship.\n\nREAD ALSO: Herders\u2019 Threat: What Is Going On In Nigeria Is Unconstitutional, Clark Tells Buhari\n\n\u201cThis will further worsen Nigeria\u2019s 33% unemployment rate which is the highest in the world, improve Nigeria\u2019s ranking as the country with the second-highest poverty rate in the entire world, all of which happened under APC\u2019s unfortunate stewardship.\u201d\n\nThe governors consequently requested Mr President to review the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria in the national interest.\n\nSpeaking concerning social media regulation, the governors said it can only be done within the existing laws on the subject and should not be used as an attempt to punish or gag Nigerians from enjoying constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\n\u201cNigerian youths do not have adequate access to employment and a lot of Nigerians rely on Twitter for their livelihood, businesses, and self-employment,\u201d the PDP governors added.\n\nRead below the communique issued at the end of the meeting:\n\nThe PDP Governors\u2019 Forum held a meeting on 14th June 2021 at Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, where it once again reviewed the state of the nation.\n\nThe meeting deliberated in particular on the deteriorating economic and security situation in the country, and worsening social and political tensions and issued the following communique:\n\nThe Forum examined the operations of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and expressed alarm at the OPAQUE manner it carries out its operations. It decried the recent NNPC\u2019s decision not to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, thereby starving the States and Local Governments and indeed Nigerians of funds needed for employment, development and general well-being.\n\nThe meeting emphasised that under the Constitution, the NNPC is duty-bound to make proceeds of sale or business of Petroleum available to the Federation Account which belongs to the three tiers of government, excluding reasonable and verified and verifiable cost of operations.\n\nThe Federal government through NNPC is a manager of our oil wealth merely as A TRUSTEE for all Nigerians. The meeting frowned at a situation where the NNPC decides in a totally discretionary and often whimsical manner, how much to spend, how to spend it, and how much to remit to the Federation Account, contrary to the letters and even the spirit of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe meeting called on other agencies of Government such as Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Federal Inland Revenue Services, Customs and Excise, and similar organisations that are statutorily required to make contributions into the Federation Account, to do more. The federating states should, going forward, now have a say in the determination of operating costs to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nThe meeting called for urgent steps to reverse these ugly trends in our practice of democracy, constitutionalism, and federalism.\n\nThe PDP Governors also expressed deep concerns about the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It viewed with regret that the CBN is operating as an independent government within a government, which is a pervasion of the autonomy of the bank.\n\nA situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order. It has become not just a LEVIATHAN, but also a Father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government.\n\nThe meeting observed that the CBN has become such an octopus that it threatens state governments publicly, without decorum, about sanctions on any attempt to question its MODUS OPERANDI. The CBN should take immediate steps to halt the depreciation of the Naira.\n\nThe PDP Governors frowned at the rising and seemingly uncontrollable debt profile of Nigeria with over 80% of normal Appropriation spent on debt servicing. All the gains of the PDP Government under Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, GCFR, where Nigeria exited its foreign debt obligations have been destroyed. Borrowing for frivolous items such as funding the Nigerian Television Authority is scandalous.\n\nMoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 Trillion Naira is becoming clearly unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP. We should not saddle incoming generations with the undue debt burden. The borrowing spree of the APC administration if unchecked will certainly lead Nigeria into avoidable bankruptcy.\n\nThe Forum reiterated its call, which seems to have fallen on deaf ears, for the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission to URGENTLY SEND the revised Revenue Allocation Formular to Mr President for onward transmission to the National Assembly for enactment, such that more resources are made available to States and Local Governments where ordinary Nigerians reside.\n\nIt called on the Chairman and Members of the Commission to RESIGN or be relieved of their duties if they cannot discharge this sacred constitutional duty entrusted by the Nigerian people to it. The present constitutional amendment process should make the Commission more independent and accountable to all stakeholders.\n\nThe meeting expressed support for the implementation of judicial and legislative autonomy in the Federation and States, in conformity with the extant provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe meeting called for more involvement of States in mining and geophysical activities within their States. This is necessary not just to curtail harm to the environment but to further diversify the Nigerian economy and complement Oil as a foreign exchange earner for Nigeria.\n\nThe PDP Governors further reviewed the emerging threats to our democracy, constitutionalism, and rule of law and cautioned the Federal Government to exercise power with restraint. The need for law and order is paramount to secure our nation but mindless killings of innocent civilians should be avoided and is hereby condemned.\n\nIt is in the same vein that the meeting reiterated its earlier revulsion at any attack on security personnel and their property anywhere in the country as a criminal and egregious act for which perpetrators should be brought to book.\n\nThe meeting examined the suspension of TWITTER from operating in Nigeria and condemned the personalised reasons given for the action. The mere ego of Mr President is not enough for such a drastic action that deprives millions of Nigerians of such an affordable means of expression and communication. We hope that this is not a harbinger or early warning signs of descent into dictatorship.\n\nThe meeting noted that social media regulation can only be done within the existing laws on the subject and should not be used as an attempt to punish or gag Nigerians from enjoying constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\nNigerian youths do not have adequate access to employment and a lot of Nigerians rely on TWITTER for their livelihood, businesses, and self-employment. This will further worsen Nigeria\u2019s 33% unemployment rate which is the highest in the world, improve Nigeria\u2019s ranking as the country with second-highest poverty rate in the entire world, all of which happened under APC\u2019s unfortunate stewardship.\n\nThe meeting consequently requested Mr President to review the suspension of TWITTER operations in Nigeria in the national interest.\n\nThe meeting further called on the APC-led Federal government to think outside the box and find solutions to the challenges facing electricity supply in Nigeria as the current system is certainly not delivering the power needed for Nigeria\u2019s rapid industrialisation.\n\nOn the recurring question of insecurity of lives and property in Nigeria, the PDP Governors reiterated the need to decentralise the operations of the security apparatus of state even within the existing legal framework, to ensure the input of local operators in State and Local Governments in policing and security.\n\nIt lamented the fact that Mr President seems not to be aware that the coercive instruments of State security are firmly within his hands and not the Governors, considering his recent media interview on the subject. The meeting reminded Mr. President that he has ultimate authority under the Constitution over security organisations, even though the States have a role to play.\n\nCooperation and synergy between States and the Federal Government in security operations are critical in securing Nigeria. In any case, even though, Police are on the Exclusive List, the States, as a practical matter spend huge sums of money to support the security agencies to carry out their duties.\n\nThe need for an appropriate legal framework to involve the States in policing has become even more urgent by the day.

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday raised an alarm over the rate at which the All Progressives Congress (APC) is borrowing money to fund projects in the country.\n\nThis formed part of the resolutions reached at the end of the meeting of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum held in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.\n\n\u201cMoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 trillion is becoming clearly unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP.\n\n\u201cWe should not saddle incoming generations with an undue debt burden. The borrowing spree of the APC administration if unchecked will certainly lead Nigeria into avoidable bankruptcy,\u201d a communique issued at the end of the meeting read in part.\n\nThe governors decried that the debt profile of Nigeria with over 80 per cent of normal appropriation spent on debt servicing was rising and becoming uncontrollable.\n\nThey stated that all the gains of the PDP government under former President Olusegun Obasanjo when the nation exited its foreign debt obligations had been destroyed.\n\nREAD ALSO: JAMB Asks Applicants To Complete UTME Registration By Tuesday\n\nThe governors accused the present administration of borrowing for frivolous items, stressing that such an action was scandalous.\n\nThey faulted the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which they claimed was functioning as an independent government-within-a-government.\n\n\u201cA situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a leviathan, but also a Father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government,\u201d the communique read.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe meeting observed that the CBN has become such an octopus that it threatens state governments publicly, without decorum, about sanctions on any attempt to question its Modus Operandi. The CBN should take immediate steps to halt the depreciation of the naira.\u201d\n\nTackling Insecurity\n\nThe governors also called for the decentralisation of the operations of the security apparatus of the state, even within the existing legal framework.\n\nThey explained that the move became necessary in the face of the disturbing spate of insecurity in the land, to ensure the input of local operators in state and local governments in policing and security.\n\nThe governors decried that President Muhammadu Buhari seemed not to be aware that the coercive instruments of state security were firmly within his hands and not the governors, considering his recent media interview on the subject.\n\nThey reminded the President that he has ultimate authority under the Constitution over the security organisations, even though the states have a role to play.\n\nThe leaders believe cooperation and synergy between states and the Federal Government in security operations were critical in securing the nation and its people.\n\nThey stated that despite being on the Exclusive List, the states spend huge sums of money to support the police and other security agencies to carry out their duties.\n\nThe governors called on the National Assembly to expedite action in passing the Electoral Act and Constitution amendments to ensure restructuring and decentralisation of governmental powers and functions.\n\nRead the communique issued at the end of the meeting below:",

          "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo has refused to commit his future to Juventus ahead of Portugal\u2019s start to Euro 2020.\n\nRonaldo has a year left on his contract with the Italian giants, but that has not stopped intermediaries from assessing whether leading European clubs want to make a move for the Portugal captain.\n\nRonaldo is expected to decide his future after the European Championship. Speaking ahead of Portugal\u2019s opener against Hungary on Budapest on Tuesday, Ronaldo was asked about his club future and he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been playing at a high level for 18 years, it doesn\u2019t even tickle me. If I were starting now, being 18 or 19 maybe, I wouldn\u2019t sleep thinking about my future.\n\n\u201cBut as you can calculate by now, at 36-years-old\u2026 whatever comes will be for the good, regardless of whether one stays or leaves, that\u2019s not the most important thing now. The focus is on the national team. A competition of this magnitude you don\u2019t play every day.\u201d\n\nRonaldo just completed his third season at Juve and helped the team win the Coppa Italia. The Turin giants missed out on the Serie A title and were eliminated by FC Porto in the round of 16 of the Champions League.\n\n\u201cThis is my fifth European Championship but for me it feels as though it\u2019s my first,\u201d Ronaldo said, with Portugal looking to defend the trophy they won in France in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for me is to start on the right foot tomorrow, to win and play well. Positive thinking. This is obviously not the same team as in 2016, it is a younger team with enormous potential.\n\n\u201cOnly competition will tell if we are better or worse.\u201d Ronaldo believes it\u2019s his ability to adapt to the changing of the game that has allowed him to continue to be successful. On a personal level, I\u2019m not the same player I was 18 years ago, 10 years ago or five years ago.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence of a football player is to adapt to the game. The game itself is different. Players who have longevity in football are those who can adapt. The numbers speak for themselves: I have adapted from 18 to 36. I always work to achieve things on a personal and collective level. I think the times have been very positive. I think I\u2019ve adapted very well to all the times I\u2019ve played.\u201d\n\nRonaldo, who scored 36 goals in 44 appearances for Juve this past season, goes into the tournament looking to break a few records. Should he hit the back of the net in this tournament, he will become the leading scorer in Euro finals as he is level on nine goals with France great Michel Platini.\n\nHe has made 55 appearances in European competition (qualifying phase and finals) with Portugal, with Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon having made a record 58 appearances. Ronaldo has also scored 104 goals in 175 appearances for Portugal, just five fewer than Iranian Ali Daei\u2019s all-time men\u2019s record of 109 international goals.\n\n\u201cThe most beautiful record would be to win the Euros twice in a row,\u201d Ronaldo said. \u201cThe team has been doing well, it\u2019s prepared. I hope that tomorrow the team goes on with the right foot, which is very important in this type of competition. We\u2019re going to play against a well-prepared team, who will have the support of the public in their stadium. It\u2019s important to have the fans.\u201d\n\nPortugal suffered a setback in their preparations for Tuesday\u2019s opener against Hungary. Coach Fernando Santos was forced to make a late change to the squad with Manchester United\u2019s Diogo Dalot, on loan at AC Milan, replacing Manchester City right-back Joao Cancelo, who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt was a shame that Joao tested positive, but we\u2019re not worried about that,\u201d Ronaldo added.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t even talk about COVID-19. It\u2019s a subject that already tires everyone out. Unfortunately, we have to live with it. In my opinion this team is focused on the game. It will be the first European Championship for many of them. The rest does not affect this team.\u201d",

          "text": "Denmark\u2019s players have expressed dissatisfaction at the position they were put in after teammate Christian Eriksen\u2019s collapse during their Euro 2020 opener on Saturday, having to decide whether to finish the match that evening or the next morning.\n\nUEFA offered the players, who gathered in the dressing room after they witnessed Eriksen being treated on the pitch following a cardiac arrest, the choice of resuming the match on Saturday night or beginning again on Sunday at noon local time (11 a.m. BST, 6 a.m. ET).\n\n\u201cWe were put in a position which I personally don\u2019t think we should have been put in,\u201d Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel told reporters on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt probably required that someone above us had said that it was not the time to make a decision and maybe should wait for the next day,\u201d he added.\n\nMidfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg also said Eriksen delivered a message via video link from the hospital to say that he is doing OK and that Denmark should try to focus on playing their next game, against Belgium on Thursday in Copenhagen.\n\nUEFA officials were not immediately available for comment. But European football\u2019s governing body wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the match would be restarted \u201cfollowing the request made by players of both teams.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had two options. None of the options were good. We took the least bad one. There were a lot of players that weren\u2019t able to play the match. They were elsewhere [mentally],\u201d Danish striker Martin Braithwaite said Monday.\n\n\u201cYou could have wished for a third option in this situation,\u201d he added.\n\nEriksen collapsed just before half-time and was taken to hospital after receiving CPR on the pitch. After a long suspension, the game resumed at 8:30 p.m. CET, and Finland went on to win 1-0.\n\nThe comments echoed criticism from former Danish internationals Peter Schmeichel and Michael Laudrup on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSomething terrible like that happens and UEFA gives the players an option to go out and play the game or come back at 1200 on Sunday. What kind of option is that?\u201d Peter Schmeichel, the father of Kasper, told the BBC on Sunday.\n\nUEFA said it had dealt with the matter as carefully as it could at the time, however.\n\n\u201cUEFA is sure it treated the matter with utmost respect for the sensitive situation and for the players,\u201d a statement said. \u201cIt was decided to restart the match only after the two teams requested to finish the game on the same evening.\n\n\u201cThe players\u2019 need for 48 hours\u2019 rest between matches eliminated other options.\u201d\n\nJonas Baer-Hoffman, general secretary of international players\u2019 union FIFPRO, said the decision should not have been made in the immediate aftermath of the incident.\n\n\u201cIt would have been better to cancel the game in that evening. Take a bit of time, take a breath, look at it with a bit more distance, look at what are the options to carry on with the game or not, and if the game can\u2019t be replayed then I think also that would not be very important in comparison to what happened there to Christian,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe players were probably not given a real option in terms of taking a good decision that was in that moment in balance with where they were mentally,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of lessons that need to be drawn from this,\u201d he said, adding that they would be conducting a review with UEFA.\n\nDenmark coach Kasper Hjulmand also said on Sunday that he did not think the players should have been back on the pitch.\n\nThe Danish Football Association said on Monday that the 29-year-old Eriksen remained in stable condition in a nearby hospital.",
