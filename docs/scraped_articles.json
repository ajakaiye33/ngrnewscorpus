The party candidate on Monday, 21st February 2022 unleashed havoc on PDP supporters using hoodlums and militia men and dispersed a PDP rally in the Ntu Community in Ngor-Okpala. They threatened to maim anybody who dares to attend the rally. But of course, Ntu people resisted them and came out in their hundreds.\n\n\u201cThe PDP notes with dismay the desperate move by Uzodimma to give ten bags of rice to each polling unit to entice the voters. We, therefore, condemn vote buying and undue inducement of voters in Ngor Okpala.\n\nUnfortunately, the APC government which brought untold hardship to lmo people is trying to use food as bait to catch votes. Ngor Okpala people are proud and hardworking, so their conscience cannot be bought with mere rice.\n\n\u201cImo PDP, therefore, wishes to use this medium to alert the security agencies in the state of the atrocities the APC plans to perpetuate in Ngor-Okpala and calls on them to move in and ensure a hitch-free election and the security of lives and property of the people.\n\nThe PDP also uses this medium to call on the international community, civil society organisations and all lovers of peace and democracy to be at alert as APC plans to subvert the wishes of Ngor-Okpala people on Saturday, 26th February 2022,\u201d PDP said.\n\nWhen Vanguard called the APC State Publicity Secretary, Cajetan Duke, he said he was in a meeting and would call back.\n\nBut reacting to the development, the Imo State Government rubbished the claim by the PDP.\n\nA statement by Declan Emelumba, Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Imo State said: \u201cThe PDP\u2019s Claim that Governor Hope Uzodimma is giving 10 bags of rice to each polling unit for the bye-election is an absurd baseless and complete falsehood, coming from a sinking party that foresees defeat on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe PDP knows that it will lose the bye-election, hence it is looking for an alibi. Governor Hope Uzodimma is a democrat who believes that people will always freely choose who they want in an election unhindered. He will never subscribe to vote-buying.\n\n\u201cAt any rate, Ngor-Okpala people are sufficiently enlightened not to return an irresponsible party that abandoned their seat in the house of Assembly for two years, to the same House. The PDP should cover its face in shame and apologise to Ngor-Okpala people for treating them with utmost disrespect and disdain.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

You are hereby sentenced to death. You shall die in a manner to be directed by Akwa Ibom State Governor. May God have mercy on your soul.\u201d Court held.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

B.

          "text": "Oil rose to its highest since 2014 yesterday after Moscow ordered troops into two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, adding to supply concerns that are pushing prices towards $100 a barrel.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, was up $1.93, or two per cent, at $97.32, having earlier reached its highest since September 2014 at $99.50.\n\nUnited States\u2019 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped by $2.96, or 3.3 per cent, from Friday to $94.03, with the market having been closed on Monday for a public holiday. WTI also touched a seven-year high on Tuesday as it peaked at $96.\n\nGermany put the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia on ice while the United States (US) and European Union (EU) discussed potential sanctions as Ukraine reported continued shelling in east Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe potential for a rally over $100 a barrel has received an enormous boost.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThose who have bet on such a move anticipated the escalation of the conflict, \u201d said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.\n\nJulius Baer analyst, Norbert Rucker, added: \u201cWe see the oil market in a period of frothiness and nervousness, spiced up by geopolitical fears and emotions.\n\n\u201cGiven the prevailing mood, oil prices may very likely climb into the triple digits in the near term.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the Federal Government has declared its intention to invest and focus attention on natural gas exploitation in the country.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, stated this yesterday at the Sixth GECF Summit in Doha, Qatar, where represented President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Senior Adviser (Media & Communications) to the minister, Horatius Egua, made this known in a statement.\n\nThe aide said: \u201cThe recent enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is an indication of our commitment to derive more value from natural gas by providing the required governance, regulatory and fiscal framework to support the growth of the industry.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigeria, a gas province with some oil, \u201cis committed to sustainable growth of natural gas exploitation and utilization, both for domestic use and export via LNG and pipeline gas to sub-regional African countries\u201d stressing that \u201cNigeria is embarking on different initiatives, projects, and policies to enhance the performance of the oil and gas sector\u201d.\n\nHe listed some of the gas initiatives Nigeria is currently embarking upon to include the National Gas Expansion Program (NGEP), designed to provide framework and policy support to extend gas supply and utilization in power generation, gas-based industries, and in emerging niche gas sectors such as gas in transportation LPG for cooking and remote virtual gas supply using trucks to convey LNG and CNG to industries.\n\nThe others initiatives according to the president are the Ajaokuta-Abuja-Kano gas pipeline to support 5 billion cubic feet per day of domestic gas utilization in the near term and 5-Gigawatt power generation, the expanding of the current LNG production capacity to about 30 million tons per annum at Bonny with the on-going N-LNG Train 7 project and the declaration of 2021-2030 as the Decade of Gas towards a gas-powered economy, that would not only lower Nigeria\u2019s GHG emissions but also reduce the country\u2019s import bills.\n\nThe President noted that with natural gas projected to be the leading fossil fuel in the energy transition, \u201cthe GECF, given its member countries vast natural gas resources and experience in the oil and gas industry, is well positioned to provide stewardship and credible platform to promote natural gas as a sustainable fuel for an effective energy transition. ..We therefore need to continue to assess the gas and energy market dynamics both in the short, medium, and long-term timeframe with the aim of taking market opportunities and collectively address the challenges.\n\nTo achieve the set objectives, he called for the \u201cneed to work together as policy makers, investors, the energy industry decision makers, researchers, and technology developers to make modern energy sources such as natural gas available and affordable to all\u201d.\n\nWhile restating Nigeria\u2019s commitment to Conference of Parties (COP26) Glasgow declaration towards zero carbon emissions, the president however noted the importance of natural gas for effective energy transition towards a low carbon future and as a fuel for socio-economic development, taking into consideration its credentials such as abundant, flexible, cleanest fossil fuel, and its versatility.\n\nThe Ukraine crisis has added further support to an oil market that has surged on tight supplies as demand recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, together known as OPEC+, have resisted calls to boost supply more rapidly.\n\nA senior British minister on Tuesday said that Russia\u2019s move into Ukraine has created a situation as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when a confrontation between the United States and Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nNigeria\u2019s minister of state for petroleum on Tuesday stuck to the OPEC+ view that more supply was not needed, citing the prospect of more production from Iran if its nuclear deal with world powers is revived.\n\nTalks are ongoing on renewing Iran\u2019s nuclear agreement with world powers, which could eventually boost Iran\u2019s oil exports by more than 1 million barrels per day.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) has agreed on a zoning formula that would swap its national offices held between the north and south in the last eight years.\n\nThe decision was part of the outcome of the meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari and APC governors in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe governors had tabled their decisions on the forthcoming national convention of the party before the president during the meeting which lasted for about 15 minutes.\n\nSpeaking to State House Correspondents on the outcome of the meeting, Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai, explained that all offices occupied by northerners in the last eight years would go to the south while the south would take up offices occupied by northerners under the new arrangement.\n\nGoing by the agreement, the positions to be swapped to the north are National Chairman, National Organising Secretary, National Youth Leader, National Auditor and National Deputy Publicity Secretary. In the same vein, the positions to be taken up by southerners in the party are National Secretary, National Treasurer, National Woman Leader, National Youth Leader, National Publicity Secretary, National Deputy Organising Secretary and National Special Leader.\n\nEl-Rufai said the agreement was reached in line with the zoning formula in the party.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed to a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, the northern zone will have the positions the south have had in the last eight years. And vice versa. It is a very simple, equitable and fair formula.\n\n\u201cWe will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention,\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna governor said the APC governors were divided over the timing of the national convention.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThere were some governors that felt that we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress\u2019s issues in some states. As you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.\n\n\u201cIn a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra state agreeing on any issue. We can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we\u2019re all on the same page.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, however said the APC governors were not divided.\n\n\u201cAre governor divided? Not at all. The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President, we are appreciative of his leadership, we commend him for his leadership, we are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thanked them to the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.\u201d\n\nBugudu said President Buhari was in favour of a consensus arrangement for the selection of candidates for party offices.\n\nHe said though the planned zonal congresses of the APC is not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.\n\nChairman, Northern Governors Forum and Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, dismissed fears that the ruling party will collapse at the end of President Buhari\u2019s era.\n\nAt the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha and Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.",

However, it is important to put into consideration, the consequences of these factions during and after elections. It is important to remind you that the ignoble creation of factions in our party in Rivers and Zamfara states cost the party the governorship elections in those states.\u201d",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe minister added that Nigeria\u2019s economy and population remained the largest in Africa with over $400 billion in gross domestic product and over 200 million people.\n\nShe said the huge and growing population offered both an economic challenge and opportunity in the light of constrained revenue proceeds brought on by several multi-dimensional factors, including the global pandemic and its impact on the domestic economy.\n\nAhmed also said against the backdrop of the challenges, the current administration has successfully implemented a range of infrastructure programmes that have had a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of the citizenry.\n\nShe reiterated that quality infrastructure is important, not only to engender and accelerate economic growth, but also to ensure and enhance inclusive growth for all within a nation space.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAhmed recalled that the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme (RITCS) was launched in 2019 to leverage private sector capital and expertise to construct, repair and maintain critical road infrastructure in key economic corridors and industrial clusters in Nigeria. She stated that the RITCS scheme was designed to complement and ameliorate the burden of funding significant capital outlays on road projects by the Federal Government.\n\nAhmed said as a model, the RITCS adopted the use of tax expenditures, via tax credits, to finance the construction of critical road and bridge infrastructure projects, while utilising an innovative PPP mechanism that is aimed at the incentivisation of private sector participation and capital investments.\n\n\u201cThe Scheme commenced in 2019, with the president\u2019s approval of 19 Road Projects covering 769.16 km and located in 11 states across the six geopolitical zones. Subsequently, construction commenced with the reconstruction of the Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota Road in Lagos State (34 km), re-construction of Obajana-Kabba road (43km) in Kogi State \u2013 both invested in and undertaken by Dangote Industries Limited, while the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited undertook the construction of the Bodo-Bonny road and the bridges across the Opobo channel in Rivers state (40 km).\n\n\u201cSince the inception of the RITCS, the president has approved 14 additional roads, bringing the total to thirty-three (33) Road Projects, covering a total length of 1,564.95 km as of 2021. These additional projects are in 19 States across the six (6) geo-political zones in the country. In the last three years (2019 \u2013 2021), about N78 billion worth of tax credits have been issued to investors under the RITCS. In addition, the NNPC is to finance the construction of 21 roads across the country.\u201d\n\nOn the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) Infrastructure Development Projects (NIF), Ahmed disclosed that over a period of seven years (2015 \u2013 2021), the government invested and completed 13 projects across seven key sectors, including healthcare, education, agriculture, financial services, and housing.",

          "title": "Citing Emergence of Previous Chairmen, Buhari Okays Consensus for APC Convention",
          "text": "\u2022El-Rufai denies division among colleagues\n\n\u2022Confirms they initially disagreed, but now on same page\n\n\u2022Party zones offices, adopts PDP formula, swaps positions between North and South\n\n\u2022Chairmanship goes to North-central, National Secretary South-west\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, met with governors elected on the platform of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and okayed suggestions for a consensus option at the newly proposed March 26 national convention of the party.\n\nBuhari met with the APC governors at the State House, Abuja, for about 15 minutes and discussed the current state of the party and the misgivings about its national convention. He noted that all former chairmen of APC, from Chief Bisi Akande, John Odigie-Oyegun, to Adams Oshiomhole, emerged through consensus.\n\nBut Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, dismissed insinuations that the 22 governors of APC and the Anambra State Deputy Governor were sharply divided over the date of the national convention, saying they merely disagreed. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen after the APC governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari, however, noted that the governors had disagreed over the timing of the national convention, as some were of the belief that there were many unresolved issues. But he contended that they were all now on the same page.\n\nEl-Rufai said APC had adopted a formula, which was embraced by the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during its convention. Under the plan, APC would allow its northern and southern members swap positions from the ones held by the previous National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nJudging by the copy of the zoning formula obtained by THISDAY last night, APC had resolved to have its national chairman come from the North-central, while conceding the office of National Secretary to the South-west.\n\nDespite its recent challenges, Chairman of Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, allayed concerns that the ruling party might collapse after Buhari\u2019s tenure. Lalong believed APC would be stronger after the incumbent president.\n\nEl-Rufai, who was fielding questions from State House correspondents, said the governors had disagreed over the timing of the convention, because, \u201cThere were some governors that felt we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress issues in some states.\n\n\u201cAs you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.\n\n\u201cYes, there were differences in opinions about timing. Some of us are saying the constitution allows us to have convention even if three or four states have issues that are unresolved, while others are saying no, let us finish all the reconciliations and we do this convention. After all, there is no time limit for the convention as long as we do it before the time for the primaries.\n\n\u201cSo, that was the difference. This is what the media has called divided governors. In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra State agreeing on any issue.\n\n\u201cWe can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we are all on the same page.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna State governor also disclosed that APC had agreed on a zoning formula that would swap offices previously held between North and South.\n\nBy the arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last NWC will go to the South, and vice versa, in the coming dispensation.\n\nEl-Rufai affirmed that agreement had been reached on zoning.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south has had in the last NWC, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also after their meeting with Buhari, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, revealed that Buhari was in favour of consensus in selecting candidates for party offices.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cOn consensus, Mr. President reminded us that we have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus: Baba Akande emerged as the pioneer chairman of the party by consensus; His Excellency, John Oyegun emerged by consensus; His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole emerged by consensus.\n\n\u201cSo, he is a believer in consensus as one of the options for producing leadership, and he urged us to explore consensus, so that we can generate a list. While recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent, but knowing that just one person will occupy the office, consensus is part of our constitution, and he urged us to work towards consensus.\n\n\u201cAnd the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level; it\u2019s almost certain that we will achieve it.\n\n\u201cThen, the date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday on their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have heard the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position.\u201d\n\nBagudu explained that even though the planned zonal congresses of APC were not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOn proposed zonal congresses not in the constitution, I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday (Monday), there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn.\n\n\u201cSo, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the constitution, particularly, how you do zonal congresses. And we have in the past done them with national convention, but nothing again in the constitution stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC governors were divided, Bagudu retorted, \u201cAre governors divided? Not at all! The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President; we are appreciative of his leadership. We commend him for his leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Lalong maintained that the ruling party would not collapse after Buhari\u2019s exit, saying, \u201cI think that from the progress report read by our chairman, and from several assumptions, and also several reports that we are seeing what tremendous efforts the federal government is doing. We are already going around commissioning projects here and there in all the various states.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, although, you are not specific as to which reason will make us not to come back again, but as far as we are concerned, based on assessment, and based on what the federal government is doing, there is every hope that this party, this government will move beyond our president and that is what he has been saying, that by the grace of God, this government will move beyond his tenure.\u201d\n\nNineteen of the 22 APC governors were in attendance at the meeting held at the Council Chambers, which also had in attendance Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nThe governors in attendance were those of Yobe, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Cross River, Kaduna, Lagos, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Kano, Imo, Kogi, Ogun, Plateau and Anambra\u2019s deputy governor.\n\nZoning Formula\n\nAccording to the zoning formula obtained yesterday by THISDAY, APC has zoned its chairmanship position to North-central, which implies that the presidential ticket of the party might go to the south, in addition to the office of the National Secretary, which has been given to the South-west in specific.\n\nOther positions zoned to the North-central are National Vice Chairman (NC), Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nAPC zoned the following positions to the South-south: National Vice Chairman (SS), National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader\n\nThe offices zoned to the South-west are National Secretary, National Vice Chairman (South-West), National Youth Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nFor the North-west, the positions given are National Vice Chairman (NW), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability \u2013 PWD) Leader, among others.\n\nThe party zoned the position of the Deputy National Chairman (S) to the South-east, with other offices like National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nNorth-east would produce Deputy National Chairman (N), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (NW), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, among others.\n\nInterestingly, the zoning plan has tactically knocked out a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and Sunny Monidafe.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants favoured by the method are the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Musa; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; and former governors of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura and Abdudulahi Adamu.\n\nBuni Threatens to Resign\n\nBut while APC may have succeeded in dousing the raging issues over its national convention, a new problem seems to be developing.\n\nAn insider told THISDAY last night that the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had threatened to resign his position, citing accusations of inefficiency from many APC governors accused.\n\nThe source said regarding Buni, \u201cWhile some of the governors were ready to grab his resignation, others cautioned that accepting his resignation would draw the party back. And on the basis of that, the governors encouraged him to continue until the national convention is held.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the governors and the president agreed to swap offices between North and South, THISDAY gathered that the leaders of the party specifically agreed that the national chairman should go to the North-central.\n\nAccording to the source, while the party\u2019s leaders agreed on consensus option in electing the national officers, the governors agreed that the president should be given the privilege to pick the national chairman.\n\nThus, ahead of the national convention on March 26, the meeting yesterday also agreed to hold national caucus meeting to resolve all pending issues.\n\nAPC EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL CONVENTION 2022\n\nZONING OF NATIONAL OFFICES\n\nSouth-South:\n\n(Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River,\n\nDelta, Edo and Rivers States)\n\n1.

          "text": "\u2022Says 1,130 Benin bronzes due back from Germany this year\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to countries, institutions, and bodies, both private and public, to return Nigeria\u2019s artefacts in their possession. Buhari also disclosed that 1,130 Benin bronzes would be returned to Nigeria by the German government before the end of this year.\n\nReacting to the recent return of two important Nigerian artefacts from Britain, the president, in a statement yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, welcomed the official handover, on Saturday, of the Okwukor and the Head of an Oba of Benin Bronzes, to the Oba of Benin, His Royal Highness, Oba Ewuare II. The artefacts were repatriated from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen, respectively, in the United Kingdom, after 125 years of their leaving the territory of present day Nigeria.\n\nIn a passionate plea for return of the objects, which form a significant part of the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage, Buhari recalled that the artefacts, now returned to the Oba of Benin, were taken away by British soldiers in 1897, when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom and took thousands of items away.\n\nAccording to the president, \u201cThese artefacts are part of the records of the history of the Benin people. My directive to return these artefacts to the Oba of Benin marks the beginning of another aspect in the highly valued relationship between the federal government of Nigeria and our traditional institutions who are, indeed, the true custodians of our history, customs, and traditions.\n\n\u201cThis directive is also significant because it will introduce a working relationship between the federal government, as represented by the NCMM, and the traditional institutions whereby this commission negotiates the release of antiquities from foreign museums and institutions on behalf of Nigeria and the traditional institutions that lost the antiquities and jointly they all take steps to ensure the valourisation of Nigerian and Nigerian people through these great arts and cultural emblems.\u201d\n\nWhile urging other countries to take a cue from the institutions, the president vowed that the federal government would pursue the repatriation of Nigerian artefacts vigorously. He pledged that government would ensure that they were put to good and proper use on their return in museums and other facilities in conjunction with the royal families and kingdoms that lost these artefacts.\n\nThe president noted that in line with international law and practice, export, import, and control over antiquities were matters within the purview of national governments, to be exercised on behalf of sub-national authorities, institutions and bodies. He thanked the government of the United Kingdom that facilitated the return of the artefacts by issuing the prerequisite Export Permits to Nigeria at no cost, as well as the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen who agreed to return these artefacts to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese are unprecedented moves worth emulating by others,\u201d he said, adding that the federal government hopes to work hand in hand with the British authorities in the future to encourage the return of more Nigerian artefacts from the United Kingdom.\n\nBuhari also appreciated the Federal Republic of Germany, which was planning the process of repatriating 1,130 Benin bronzes to Nigeria this year from many of Germany\u2019s public museums.\n\nHe also commended the High Commissioner of Nigeria to the United Kingdom, Sarafa Ishola, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) for their collaborative works that led to the repatriation of the artefacts. According to him, it is noteworthy that several others are currently in the process of being returned while discussions are on-going to repatriate many more.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Fintech Focus: Why KYC compliance is crucial for fintechs",
          "text": "As digital financial services providers penetrate the African market at large, there is a need to ensure that fintech startups lay a strong foundation for a robust risk, fraud, anti-money laundering (AML)/combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), and compliance framework.\n\nThis is to ensure that they have a system that promptly detects fraud, and their platforms are not used as a conduit for money laundering, cybercrime, and other related crimes.\n\nIn Nigeria, the use of ATM card details and mobile banking PINs for fraudulent transactions is commonplace. Per the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF), cases of electronic bank fraud cost lenders $14.2 million between 2016 and 2018.\n\nA robust risk and compliance framework entail having inter alia an effective and efficient Know Your Customer (KYC) program in line with regulatory requirements; fraud prevention, detection, and prevention monitoring program; transaction monitoring process for prompt detection and reporting of suspicious activities and transactions as well as risk assessment and sanction screening programme.\n\nThis article focuses on Know Your Customer compliance and fraud.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cKYC simply means processes banks and other financial institutions use to ensure that customers are who they claim to be,\u201d Mobolaji Bammeke, Chief Compliance Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal. \u201cIt\u2019s at the heart of fraud prevention processes, as required by laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nEssentially, KYC involves fintech companies and other institutions with financial duties collecting specific information (including but not limited to full name, phone numbers, national ID numbers, utility bills, international passport, etc.) from potential customers\u2014whether individual or corporate entities.\n\nThis is often done at the time of onboarding and where relevant, identity documents are validated before customers are approved.\n\nJumps to the next platform.\n\n\n\nRinse, Repeat.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s high time we came together to build an open source fraud database to curb this & create more trust in the ecosystem. \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/SdmCgXgmEU \u2014 GB \ud83e\udd8b (@TechProd_Arch) May 9, 2020\n\nWhy\u2019s this important? These measures serve as a line of defence against financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. KYC tests are typically very simple and easy to implement but when executed well, can be highly effective in preventing fraud.\n\n\u201cCompliance with KYC requirements prevents money launderers from using your platform as a conduit for fraud or other illicit financial activity,\u201d Bammeke notes. \u201cIt\u2019s in line with AML and CFT regulations. Typically, access is restricted for users that do not fulfil KYC requirements.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that KYC is a continuous process. That is, after the initial onboarding is concluded, a financial company is required to regularly monitor client accounts to detect suspicious activity that indicates fraud or relates to financial crimes. If such unusual activities occur, a new KYC evaluation process is necessary.\n\nBeyond identity checks, KYC policies ensure sound business practices and offer insightful data on customers. For instance, they can help companies evaluate the financial status of clients and determine creditworthiness where relevant.\n\nHow can fintechs get compliance right?\n\nFintech companies may not necessarily be financial institutions (that hold funds), but their transactions mostly flow through traditional banks.\n\nAs an extension of doing business with lenders that are subject to the KYC regulations, they must comply with the same to manage money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk.\n\nWhat are the key considerations players should be aware of?\n\nThe KYC process is a critical step in customer acquisition, and whatever policies are implemented should ideally have little impact on the onboarding experience of prospective customers.\n\n\u201cWhen drafting KYC compliance strategy, fintechs need to balance customer needs with risk management,\u201d Bammeke says. \u201cIt\u2019s vital to not miss out on lawful customers due to overly exhaustive processes. But that does not mean skipping necessary steps to ensure regulatory compliance. There just has to be a balance.\u201d This balance is to ensure a smooth customer experience for customers.\n\nMore so, as the company expands, it should continuously improve the KYC process in line with new risks.\n\nInnovation in KYC: A peek into the future\n\nCompared to legacy institutions known for slower, more nuanced KYC compliance procedures, fintechs are nimble and have quicker, more accessible processes as their services are fully digital. The latter is thus more positioned to unlock innovative approaches to regulatory requirements like KYC.\n\nAlready, modern technologies like biometrics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain give companies new ways to achieve compliance with KYC requirements while enhancing user onboarding experience, limiting human interference, enabling greater access to financial services.\n\n\u201cIn addition, fintechs can try other ways of identity verification such as video KYC and semantic analytics,\u201d Bammeke says. \u201cLegacy systems still largely dominate the space, but we\u2019re seeing increasing KYC and AML innovations driven by modern technologies. They make the processes a lot faster, more accurate, and transparent.\u201d\n\nThe link between KYC and fraud mitigation is a compelling reason for fintechs to establish adequate authentication and verification processes.\n\nCompliance failure not only makes the company vulnerable to financial crimes but could also attract significant regulatory fines depending on the jurisdiction. An instance is the $100 million fine crypto exchange BitMex had to pay last year to settle claims of illegal trading and AML violations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, KYC is an ongoing process, it involves achieving a balance of identifying and verifying your customer\u2019s identity as well as minimizing risk in order to offer your customer base access to services without compromising on a great customer experience,\u201d adds Bammeke.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The air changes the moment you step into AfricanWorks\u2019 compound in Victoria Island, one of the highbrow areas in Lagos, Nigeria. The first thing you see are the greeneries all over the compound, the atmosphere is calm and quiet. It feels like you\u2019ve just escaped the hustle and bustle of Lagos.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the outdoor experience is a hint of what goes on in the interior.\n\nThe main door is see-through so you can tell of the comfort that awaits inside. After a minute in the lobby, Gregoire Schwebig, founder and CEO of AfricaWorks came out to meet me. He\u2019s of average height and moderately built. His energy, however, didn\u2019t feel like that of a man who had just completed a trip from Paris to Lagos that morning. As we exchanged pleasantries, one question lingered; why is this French man building a home-grown business in Africa?\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSchwebig was born and grew up in Paris with a close tie to Francophone Africa. His mother was born in Senegal, so he visited Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali and Togo while growing up. After graduating from ESSEC Business School, one of the best business schools in Europe, he went on to work at Lehman Brothers in London as a financial analyst. After Lehman Brothers liquidated, he joined Societe Generale in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2011, Schwebig joined Fanasi Capital, a venture capital fund focused on high-growth startups in East Africa, as a senior associate, and then moved to Kenya and remained there for 8 years. He was elected as a consular adviser to the French government on the affairs of 7 countries in East and South Africa. In 2016, he became the president of the Kenya chapter of the French Chamber of Commerce, a dedicated body that helps French companies and entrepreneurs set up in Kenya.\n\nSchwebig wore many hats during his time in Kenya; in 2014, he started Haussmann Africa, a corporate real estate company that built and designed custom offices for companies. The company, which he still runs till date, has designed offices for Uber, L\u2019oreal and Total.\n\nAfter designing offices for a while, he realised there were gaps he wanted to fill, so in 2019, he started AfricaWorks.\n\nAfricaWorks in Abidjan\n\nBuilding AfricaWorks\n\nThe way people work had already started shifting before the pandemic hit in 2020. The pandemic only expedited the shift and forced businesses to restructure work to fit the new normal which is hybrid.\n\nWhile there was already full-blown support for the future of work in the West, there was little or no solution in Africa to support the growing business ecosystem\u2014there was no real pan-African flexible workplace solution that could power the future of work across the continent. And here is where AfricaWorks, a pan-African flexible workspace provider chain, plugs itself.\n\nThe idea was simple: build a world-class workspace that brings together the best businesses under one roof in one city. Then scale and replicate the process in another. AfricaWorks launched its first space in Abidjan, the capital city of Ivory Coast, and now operates in 9 cities\u2014Abidjan, Accra, Cairo, Cape Town, Dakar, Dar Es Salaam, Jo\u2019burg, Lagos, and Nairobi\u2014across 8 countries and counting.\n\nAfricaWorks in Cape Town\n\nThe company lists top multinationals like Glovo, Universal Music, L\u2019oreal, Total and more as part of companies working out of its spaces.\n\n\u201cWe currently have over 150 businesses and over 2,000 individuals working from our spaces. We are also opening more spaces in the coming months,\u201d Schwebig told TechCabal.\n\nMore than just a coworking space\n\nFor AfricaWorks, as the African tech and business ecosystem grows, it will continue to grow to support them across the continent. Beyond being a pan-African coworking space, it now wants to do more as it slowly transitions into a tech company. It has started building a business-to-business (B2B) product that will provide full-on operation support for its clients.\n\n\u201cOur B2B service marketplace will be called AfricaWorks Services, which will help us connect our clients to partnered services providers like recruiting, marketing, finance, expansion, and everything else they need to grow their businesses,\u201d said Schwebig, who also co-founded French-African Foundation, an organisation that contributes to the emergence of a Franco-African succession.\n\nSchwebig with the Afriworks Lagos team\n\nThe play here is to reduce third party friction and be the only direct partner their members need. AfricaWorks Services will partner with talent companies like OfferZen and Andela to bring qualified talent to its member companies; partner with marketing and financial firms to bring quality marketing and financial services to its community; and African tradetech like Norebase to help in expansion and manage trade across Africa.\n\nSchwebig believes that Africa will play a pivotal role in the future of work and they [AfricanWorks] are positioning to be a crucial part of that movement. He believes this is becoming evident in the way the African tech ecosystem is booming and the surge in talent exodus. AfricaWorks wants to play in the talent services but first for its members and then\u2014maybe in the future\u2014expanding the services to the public.\n\nAfricaWorks operates in 9 cities and counting and these countries, though they may have similar problems, have a peculiar business landscape that requires a bespoke solution. Schwebig confirmed that, while Ivory Coast remains AfricaWorks\u2019 biggest market in terms of patronage and revenue, it has invested more in Nigeria due to the size of the market and the prospect of the tech ecosystem, especially.\n\nAfricaWorks in Nairobi\n\nAmong other places, the company is also planning to open new space at the Kotoka international airport in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAccording to Goldie Iyamu, the marketing head at AfricaWorks, by the time all the pending projects are completed, the company should push into 500 businesses and over 3,000 people working across their spaces.\n\nAfter 2 years and 6 months, AfricaWorks has experienced astronomical growth and now it\u2019s positioning itself as the partner for businesses with pan-African growth ambitions.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The destruction of patronage networks and the subsequent isolation of African art and artists during colonialism and early independence are things of the past for a group of artists who have leapfrogged their way into living rooms and boardrooms across the world.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle of bird Story Agency\n\nHuddled in a tiny office, young workers are neatly wrapping up canvases, ready for shipment. The silence in the room is loud \u2014 only interrupted by an occasional sigh, heavy breathing, or a cough. At the far end of the room, a young man is multitasking\u2014 his fingers hammering at the buttons of a laptop, while he chats on a smartphone. An air of urgency hangs in the room and he, like the rest of the team, seems pressed for time.\n\nIn an age that welcomes and pays for digitally-signed images of all types, and in which vast volumes of clothing chosen from digital catalogues traverse the world, it is perhaps not surprising that digital manifestations of art are giving artists ready markets all over the world. What might surprise many is that this system of digitally marketed, paid-for, and delivered artworks is flourishing here in Kinshasa.\n\nWelcome to the engine room of Bandombe Galerie, a virtual art gallery that is the brainchild of Sisqo Ndombe. Bandombe showcases and connects contemporary African artists with potential clients, globally.\n\n\u201cA majority of African artists do not manage to make a living from their creations because there are not enough channels dedicated to their promotion,\u201d Ndombe explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThat\u2019s where Bandombe comes in, attracting potential buyers, connecting them with artists, and then providing the platform for negotiation, payment, and delivery of the creative works.\n\n\u201cAs an artist, if you don\u2019t have a place where you can show your work to an audience, you shall never succeed,\u201d Ndombe added.\n\nWhere traditional art galleries prefer working with acclaimed artists and often shun aspiring and unknown creators \u2013 often simply because a gallery only has so much space \u2013 Ndombe felt he could solve this problem on a digital level. As the idea began to crystallise, his \u201ceureka\u201d moment struck\u2026 he could leverage the internet to not only showcase unknown talent \u2013 including his own \u2013 but also to market and sell top African art, globally.\n\n\u201cI remember the time when I had to reach out to galleries, walking long distances carrying my canvases, trying to find some buyers. I couldn\u2019t afford to do things that way anymore,\u201d he says as he recalls his journey as an artist.\n\nThe power of the internet has been a game-changer not just for him, but many more artists, who have signed up to his network across Africa.\n\nWith limited finances, the start was going to be a struggle. However, from his wages as a graphic designer in a local company, he managed to save some money and through constant sacrifice, his dream began to unfold.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Bandombe Galerie, website: bandombe.com, went up online,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the idea to sell more than just his own art evolved, he onboarded other artists. Some were reluctant but Ndombe is nothing if not persuasive and he managed to convince enough of his fellow artists to sign on with the platform. Where there was reluctance at home, artists from other African countries jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\u201cI thought my fellow Congolese would be the first to jump in, but that didn\u2019t happen. However, when they saw that artists from other countries were packing the platform, they started to join in,\u201d he said.\n\nAt first, it was not easy to get buyers to trust the concept or the platform, but Ndombe\u2019s never-say-die spirit kept the project focused on his goal \u2014 to attract buyers with unique artworks.\n\n\u201cWhat is instrumental to attract art lovers and buyers on our platform is to have a good selection of displayed works,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt took the team eight months of anxiety, patience, and sacrifice before selling their first piece.\n\n\u201cOur first client was a European woman. She had been working in Congo for a couple of years, and now she was leaving the country. She wanted to take some art piece from Congo with her as a souvenir,\u201d Ndombe recalled.\n\nIn the four years since, the Kinshasa-based virtual gallery Bandombe Galerie has grown in leaps and bounds across Africa making it one of, if not, the, most popular virtual galleries for patrons of African art launched on the continent. Currently, it has 800 registered artists from 30 African countries and more than 3,000 artworks in its catalogue.\n\nLooking back at its journey of the gallery, Ndombe said that what started as a small idea to address his dilemma is now helping some aspiring artists to emerge and gain visibility among art collectors far beyond the borders of their countries and continent.\n\n\u201cIt has given access to many African artists and their works to a wider audience and market,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of those who bought up into Ndombe\u2019s virtual gallery initiative is Rwanda-based painter, Izere Antoine.\n\n\u201cBandombe is very supportive of the up-and-coming talents and African art in general,\u201d said Izere.\n\nIzere said through the virtual gallery, he has found buyers for three of his paintings. And above all, beyond the visitations and inquiries, Bandombe has transformed his life and equipped him with tech skills to digitally market his works and brand himself.\n\n\u201cMostly it also encouraged me to be more in online marketing like websites and more,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerian artist Onofua Dennis, who has also signed on with Bandombe talks glowingly of the virtual gallery.\n\n\u201cTheir marketing competency, their capacity in dispensing durable relationships between artists, collectors, and as well as the gallery team through communication, packaging, and delivery of artworks are great,\u201d he said.\n\nParticularly, Onofua praises Bandombe\u2019s payments policy and logistics management which he says have been key in building that durable relationship between all artists and clients.\n\n\u201cPercentage of payment due to the artist is being attended to within a short period of time. More so, I have seen fantastic reports of buyers \u2013 delivered publicly \u2013 about the receiving of their package,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked if Bandombe has been helpful in helping him obtain more artistic recognition, he quickly cuts in: \u201cWell, yes\u201d, adding that; \u201cTo date, we have sold more than 214 pieces\u2026 and that is remarkable\u201d.\n\nFor Ndombe, the growth and future success of Bandombe Galerie mean more work and a commitment to growing his client base.\n\nHe is also determined to end the current trend in which the global emergence of contemporary African art is being driven mainly by non-African buyers, instead of by a local market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to sensitise our people to consume more art. We envisage the opening of a showroom and the organisation of art fairs across the continent.\n\n\u201cThe potential is huge for Africa arts, and a bright future is beckoning those with the courage to embrace the infinite opportunities offered by technology to shine on the global stage,\u201d he concluded, signing off on another deal with a remote patron.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

With its promise of anonymity and speedy transactions not limited by national borders, there has been no shortage of adopters and even evangelists.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all we have to thank the blockchain for, with NFTs generating almost as much attention as the technology. Where artists had to wait for their work to be commissioned \u2014 often by individuals in the same geographical location \u2014 they can now create and sell art for astonishing prices. Admittedly, art is not the only use case for NFTs, but it is currently the most popular.\n\nWith the often mind-boggling prices NFTs sell for, it is perhaps no surprise that they have been used in fraudulent activities, with wash trading and money laundering the most common cases.\n\nIdeally, we would expect governments to curb these issues, but NFTs are not regarded as securities, and it has become difficult to establish what is a scam. Fortunately, our reporter, Bolu Abiodun has some tips on identifying NFT scams, and you can read all about it in Wash trading scams and money laundering; why NFT traders should be careful.\n\nMarketForce raises $40 million to provide BNPL to merchants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketForce co-founders. Source: TechCrunch\n\nMost African households depend on informal retailers for their supplies. As tech eased operations in other industries, a few entrepreneurs built solutions for the eCommerce space.\n\nInitially, these solutions were B2C, but in the last few years, the focus seems to have shifted to serving the small businesses that drive commerce on the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the players in this industry \u2013 MarketForce \u2013 has raised a $40 million Series A to offer buy now, pay later (BNPL) services to its customers.\n\nV8 Capital Partners led the round, with Cellulant Co-founder, Ken Njoroge, Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, Vu Ventures, Vastly Valuable Ventures, Uncovered Fund, Reflect Ventures, Greenhouse Capital, Century Oak Capital, and Remapped Ventures participating.\n\nLast year, the startup raised $2 million in a pre-Series A round, including $150,000 from Y Combinator. Following that, it launched in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. At the time, it had just launched RejaReja to enable retailers to get next-day deliveries for products.\n\nWith its latest raise, the startup plans to grow its team to 800 while growing the number of merchants on RejaReja to 250,000 in the next few months.\n\nMarketForce is not the only startup digitising the informal retail experience, with TradeDepot, SokoWatch, Omnibiz, and Alerzo doing the same.\n\nWith low spending power and a lack of proper addressing systems limiting B2C startups, the focus has shifted to B2B. Yet, there remains a vast market opportunity for startups. A 2020 report by the International Trade Center found that ten countries accounted for 94% of all online businesses in Africa. As mobile and Internet penetration increases on the continent, more countries could get a piece of the eCommerce pie.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happens to all your online shopping returns\n\nThe moral calculations of a billionaire\n\nOpportunities\n\nAltSchool Africa is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) was one of the most popular buzzwords in the crypto community in 2021, with many news headlines talking about NFT artists and traders making a killing with NFTs.\n\nSource: Intelligence by Techpoint\n\nHowever, the much-praised blockchain is fast becoming the subject of some bad press in 2022 because of scams, which are not uncommon in investment-related activities.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US, investment fraud \u2014 involving stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies \u2014 accounted for $285 million of all social media scams in 2021.\n\nGoing by the trend of investment style fraud so far in 2022, NFT scams should be added to the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis\u2019 2022 Crypto Crime Report, a significant amount of criminal activity was associated with NFTs in 2021. The two illicit activities related to NFTs include wsh trading \u2014 artificially increasing the value of an NFT \u2014 and money laundering through the purchase of NFTs.\n\nWhat is NFT wash trading?\n\nWash trading, also known as round-tripping, is a form of market manipulation done when an investor buys a financial instrument and sells it back to himself many times. This increases the instrument\u2019s trade volume, creating the illusion that the asset is worth more than it actually is. Consequently, unsuspecting investors buy such assets only to realise they are not worth as much as they thought.\n\nWhile wash trading is done by an individual, round-tripping can be done by one person buying and selling the same security within the same trading day or by two companies selling securities to themselves and agreeing to repurchase them at about the same price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chainalysis\n\nIs wash trading illegal with NFTs?\n\nIn traditional finance, wash trading is illegal. The US was the first country to declare it unlawful in the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act, and now, the practice is against the law in almost every part of the world.\n\nHowever, in the decentralised world of NFTs, the legality of wash trading is yet to be clearly spelt out. While it is deceptive, there\u2019s no legislation anywhere in the world detailing what is right and what isn\u2019t in NFT trading as its asset class hasn\u2019t been identified.\n\nDespite this marked absence of NFT regulation and class determination, some countries have taken a stand on the practice. For example, Bithumb, a South Korean crypto exchange, was accused of allowing wash trading worth over $250 million in fake volume in 2018.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency wash trading might be illegal in some countries, it is still hard to identify the perpetrators because of the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional financial instruments \u2014 stocks and securities \u2014 with verifiable know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, blockchain-powered assets can be exchanged without revealing identities.\n\nHow to spot NFT wash trading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherscan screenshot that shows a completed wash trade. Source: Chainalysis\n\nKnowing how blockchain works is required to spot or track NFT wash trading. However, the simplest way to avoid buying NFTs with an artificial value is to purchase them from a reputable person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Chainalysis tracked wash trading activities with blockchain analysis, which revealed how sellers go about their wash trading activities.\n\nThe blockchain transactions on Etherscan showed NFTs successfully sold from one Ethereum address to another. While the transaction appeared normal, a closer look revealed that wash trading had occurred. The address that sold the NFT also sent the ETH to the buyer\u2019s address shortly before the sale. The seller financed the address used to purchase the NFT before the sale.\n\nNFT wash trading is sort of like a WhatsApp vendor sending you money to buy their products to make it seem like they\u2019re making sales. In the case of NFTs, however, one person can easily finance multiple wallets they own to purchase their listed NFTs.\n\nTo check the transactions an NFT has gone through on a marketplace like OpenSea, go to the item activity tab below the NFT, and you\u2019ll see the details of how the NFT has been bought and sold from several addresses. For more information on the NFT, click the diagonal arrow under the date column, and it takes you directly to the blockchain on which that NFT exists. You can go further by looking into the individual activity of each address associated with the NFT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSea: NFT marketplace\n\nThis is like checking the account history of someone who has sent you money; you see where their money goes and where it comes from. However, going through all these transactions is a gruelling task that should be left to experts.\n\nThe best way to avoid wash trading is to buy NFTs created by a known artist.\n\nFor example, you can decide to buy the works of an artist you\u2019ve seen, read about, or follow on social media. That way, you are sure of the value of the NFT you\u2019ve purchased based on the owner and not on trading volume.\n\nWhat does wash trading mean for the NFT market?\n\nWash trading with NFTs doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the NFT market so far. If anything, the market is doing better than ever.\n\nOpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace in the world, surpassed $3.5 billion monthly trading volume in January 2022. While NFT trade volumes continue to grow despite the scams, Chainalysis\u2019 report reveals that most wash trades didn\u2019t yield as much as the work that went into them.\n\nMost NFT wash trades have been unprofitable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash trading profits. Source: Chainalysis\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, selling an NFT to a self-financed account does not make it a wash trade; however, if it happens more than 25 times, the probability that it falls into that category is high. The research firm arrived at this conclusion after analysing the transactions of 262 sellers who sold NFTs to a self-financed account at least 25 times.\n\nInterestingly, while only 110 of the 262 sellers made more than $8 million from their wash trades, 152 incurred losses of over $400,000 from the deceptive trade. It is important to note that only NFTs bought and sold on the Ethereum network were analysed by Chainalysis; the story could very well be different on other chains such as Solana.\n\nAccording to the analysis, wash trading isn\u2019t a dominant phenomenon yet. However, if it becomes more prominent, it could encourage regulators to define NFT\u2019s asset class.\n\nWash trading isn\u2019t the only crime-related activity that can attract the attention of regulators. NFTs are gradually becoming a suitable option for money laundering. The Chainalysis Report also identified an increase in the value of NFTs purchased by illicit addresses totalling $1.4 million in Q4 2021.\n\nNFTs are not the only cryptocurrency used to carry out crimes. And according to Chainalysis, $8.6 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have so far been used in money laundering schemes in 2022.\n\nEvery form of economic value transfer can be a tool for committing crimes, and NFTs are no different. The fact that NFTs are being used for criminal activities does not impede its potential to become a tool for creators to get appreciation for their works or solve other economic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "MTN goes tech: How data overtook voice revenue",
          "text": "Last Wednesday, Africa\u2019s largest telecommunications company, MTN, took an important step towards its ambition of becoming a full-fledged technology company and the biggest digital platform on the continent by 2025, with the unveiling of a new logo.\n\nThe logo is coming ahead of a re-branding event set to take place on Monday, February 28, 2022.\n\nWhile the new logo retained the iconic yellow colour, the oval-shaped blue background with a red accent was replaced with an oval MTN in black lettering. It is a logo that is supposed to communicate the company\u2019s new transition \u2013 from telco to tech.\n\nAnyone who has followed recent developments in the company would not be surprised MTN is making the transition formal. It has been long in coming with the recruitment of Adia Sowho, the former interim CEO of Thrive Agric and a well-known face in the tech ecosystem.\n\nMTN has been on a strong push in recent years to diversify its business, pursuing new revenue streams in mobile data, technology, and related communications services to businesses, wholesale network services, fintech, and digital services.\n\nMTN is also in the job market looking to recruit 150 digital experts to ensure it keeps pace with growing digital demand.\n\nAccording to the company, the move ties with MTN Group\u2019s 2025 ambition.\n\n\u201cWe intend to lead the delivery of a bold new digital world and are therefore looking to expand our teams to ensure we keep challenging what we do to always do better,\u201d said Tebogo Maenetja, chief of human resources at MTN South Africa.\n\nSome of the roles MTN wants to fill include UX and UI designers; product owners; performance marketers; digital content specialists; eCommerce experts; full-stack developers; scrum masters, and business analysts.\n\nRead also: MTN\u2019s 2021 results in five numbers\n\nThe telco\u2019s intensity is coming from impressive growth in the data business. In 2021, MTN reported active data subscribers growth of 5.3 percent year-on-year to 34.3 million compared to its voice business, which declined by 10.6 percent in the same year due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations.\n\nThe growth in active data subscribers also reflected in the revenue, which rose to 55.3 percent in 2021, maintaining an accelerated growth trajectory in the fourth quarter as it continues to accelerate the expansion of its 4G coverage, enhance the quality and capacity of the network to support increasing data traffic, and grow active data users. The company also saw an average megabit (MB) per user grow by 62.7 percent, enabling overall data traffic growth of 85.3 percent. The telco claims its 4G network now covers 70.3 percent of the population, up from 60.1 percent in December 2020.\n\nVoice revenue was not so impressive as it grew by only 8.4 percent year-on-year in 2021. The company\u2019s fintech business rose by 57.3 percent due to sustained growth in the use of Xtratime products and broader fintech services by users.\n\nMTN also expanded its MoMo agent network, through a one distribution strategy, with the addition of over 374,000 registered agents, bringing the total number to approximately 770,000, up to 94.8 percent. The growth led to transaction volume rising by 167.0 percent to 137.5 million from an active user base of 9.4 million, up 102 percent.\n\nExperts say that for most telecom operators like MTN the shift to becoming full-fledged technology companies is driven by current economic realities and the influx of new disruptors that have seen most incumbents struggle to maintain their market leadership. In some cases, the new disruptors have swallowed supposed big old players.\n\nIn a recent report, Mckinsey noted that even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, telecom operators had been battling a decade-long disruption, one of which is the customer-back disruption led by digital natives such as Uber and Netflix. These digital natives set new standards for seamless online experiences that forced incumbents to redefine their interaction models.\n\nThere is also business-model disruption with technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and the internet of things rewriting the rules in service delivery and value-capture models. The telcos also faced the new-entrant disruption, which led to increased competition among traditional players as well as non-traditional players. This disruption has now shifted value toward technology-focused parts of the value chain.\n\n\u201cMost operators responded to these daunting challenges with a mix of efficiency measures, digitisation efforts, structural changes (such as network sharing), and productivity improvements,\u201d the Mckinsey report noted. \u201cIn parallel, many expanded into new industries, such as TV and information and communications technology (ICT), to increase revenue streams. As demonstrated by pre-COVID-19 performance, though, that formula has been running out of steam.\u201d\n\nIn the case of MTN, the disruptions drove the launch of new business verticals, most of which were aimed at increasing data consumption on the network. Generally, internet data consumption has been on the increase in Nigeria. The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) had in 2021 noted the huge demand for data.\n\n\u201cNigerians are consuming in excess of 80,000 terabytes of data every month,\u201d said Garba Umar Danbatta, executive vice-chairman, NCC, noting, \u201cWe have seen this trend for a while, with an increase in data usage associated with an increase in online activity.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, Nigeria\u2019s monthly data consumption of 80,000 terabytes (80m GB) is only surpassed by South Africa, which consumes about 269,000TB every month. Kenya and Ghana complete the four largest consumers, using 22,400TB and 8,100TB of monthly internet data, respectively.\n\nWith people consuming more data than calls, it is no surprise therefore that MTN is prioritising the former over the latter. Importantly, the company knows it needs to provide different services to ensure more people consume its data service.\n\nIn 2019 for instance, MTN launched its music streaming service, MusicTime, which it developed in partnership with Simfy Africa. The music streaming app, first introduced in South Africa in 2018, allows users to buy time on the service, data inclusive, as opposed to other streaming services that allow users to do a monthly subscription. However, the app is missing from the Play Store.\n\nOther verticals launched by the company include Ayoba, MoMo, and recently a microinsurance service called AYo, which is already launched in Ghana, Uganda, and Zambia.\n\nAccording to a BusinessDay report, AYo started out as a 50-50 partnership between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH). Over the past two years, MMH took its stake down to 25 percent before completely exiting the venture, leaving MTN as the sole owner.\n\n\u201cI believe part of what is driving the company\u2019s decision is borne out of the fact that currently, they provide telecom support services that power Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem,\u201d noted Omosomi Omomia, a manager at KPMG. \u201cMTN has over 277 million subscribers in over 20 African countries with Nigeria and South Africa being the largest market. Interestingly, MTN has business interests in tech but their core business revolves around providing telecom services such as voice and data services.\u201d\n\nOmomia said MTN would need to consolidate its different businesses into a single entity that could in no distant time begin to rival global tech companies like Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), Apple, and Alphabet\u2019s Google.\n\nMTN\u2019s next big play is the launch of 5G in Nigeria. 5G even gives the company a massive advantage to grow its data market share. It is already among the companies in South Africa with the 5G licence and is deploying at speed.\n\nIn Nigeria, the company has already paid the $273 million licence fee and is waiting for the regulator NCC to make it official on February 24. It has also closed funding, which it plans to use to fund its infrastructure across the country.",

It also allows cash transfers for people who do not have bank accounts and ATM cards.\n\nThis initiative by MTN is to ensure a secure electronic service linked to an MTN mobile phone number that enables the mobile operator\u2019s Mobile Money wallet holders to store funds, send and receive money, make payments and do a number of other transactions simply using their mobile phone.\n\nMoMo is used to send money to any MTN mobile phone user, registered or not, as well as to mobile phone users on other local networks. Also, it is used to withdraw cash at any authorised MTN Mobile Money agent, top-up MTN airtime, pay bills, buy and pay for insurance, payment of employee salaries, airline tickets, school fees, and other goods and services.\n\nIn November 2018, MTN MoMo launched in Uganda, and by May 2021, the programme was live across 12 African countries including Nigeria, with over 22 million subscribers in 15 countries.\n\nWhile MTN currently awaits final approval on a payment service bank (PSB) licence that will enable it to deploy MoMo as a mobile money service in Nigeria, the company in an interview with BusinessDay said it planned to separate the business from its telco business in the country.\n\nAyoba\n\nAyoba is a free instant messaging app, built by MTN for Africans. The platform offers users free access to an ecosystem of digital and media services through chat and call features, channels, micro-apps, and payment solutions.\n\nAyoba is localised and tailored for African and Middle East consumer needs, supporting 22 relevant languages. It has incorporated sophisticated end-to-end encryption to keep its users\u2019 data safe and ensure their privacy.\n\nThis means that messages in a conversation cannot be read by anyone else, not even the team at Ayoba. MTN\u2019s inclusive approach to technology entails that Ayoba users will be able to communicate with anyone with a mobile device, even if they don\u2019t have the Ayoba app yet.\n\nFounded two years ago, Ayoba has reached a milestone of over 10 million monthly active users, with over 180 content channels ranging from sports news, music and artists, health and wellness, careers, fashion, and beauty, as well as education and travel.\n\nRBM\n\nRBM uses the rich and interactive features of rich communication services (RCS), which is the next generation SMS that allows sharing of audio, video, images, location, among others, to enable branded business messaging.\n\nRCS messages are securely delivered to native messaging apps such as Google and Samsung messages on android phones. Available on 3G and 4G networks, RCS is the default messaging standard for 5G networks.\n\nAs of today, RCS is available globally with over 700 million monthly active users. In partnership with Google and Dotgo, MTN would leverage the services provided by Dotgo such as the RCS application programme interface (APIs), including chatbot directory, billing, payments, reconciliation, among others, to drive monetisation from RCS.\n\nRead also: MTN Group expects full year profit surging 35% as mobile giant unlocks significant value\n\nInsurance platform\n\nMTN\u2019s insurance platform is a solution that monitors driving behaviour and statistics to enable usage-based insurance.\n\nThe solution, developed by MTN Business in conjunction with technology partner Huawei, involves the installation of an on-board diagnostic (OBD) device that can feed information to the driver\u2019s mobile phone and to a data centre for use by the insurance fleet management companies.\n\nIt monitors driving statistics, driver behaviour, and the state of the vehicle, enabling insurance companies to offer usage-based policies that are based on collected and analysed data.\n\nAccording to the company, the service will initially use MTN\u2019s 3G and 2G networks for connectivity but will ultimately use the NB-IoT network that the operator is building out with Huawei.\n\nMusic streaming app\n\nMTN has a fully inclusive time-based music streaming service that offers users trending and locally relevant music through partnerships with music labels and providers.\n\nThe service, which is an offering from the team at Simfy Africa, is set to revolutionise Africa\u2019s music industry with a fully inclusive music streaming offering that includes a countdown timer, top trending music, and data included in the price.\n\nThe service works based on a timer clock that counts down as users listen to music, and there is no subscription needed. Being an app in South Africa, MusicTime is available as either: 120 minutes for R5 or 300 minutes for R10, and both packages are valid for seven days from purchase.\n\nUsers can listen to the music with no hidden data costs, advertisements, or other interruptions.",

I want you to work together as a team. We will not accept you playing politics. You are not the political heads of these agencies and ministries; leave politics for politicians and do your jobs as professionals.\n\n\u201cNote that a lot of work has been done. We expect you to key into our Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda and adjust whatever we have done that you think is not adequate. You are not coming to reinvent the will and start the process; no you are not. There is a MEGA Agenda and we all have to key into that agenda so that we can reach our destination much quicker than we have planned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese appointments are not made on the basis of political affiliation; they were made principally on track records,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, who warned detractors to desist from propagating disunity and disharmony among the people, said his administration will no longer tolerate the antics of political detractors who benefit from stirring controversies and divisions where none exist.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will not allow ourselves to be divided again. Edo is one; whether you are Edo South, Edo Central or Edo North, Edo is one. So, when people begin to manipulate and try to create divisions where they don\u2019t exist, we must ignore them.\n\n\u201cThey tell lies; they go-ahead to manufacture information and figures where they don\u2019t exist just because they want to continue to divide us and manipulate us. They have now met a government that has refused to be divided.\n\n\u201cMany of us share lineage across the state. So, where is this issue of dividing us coming from? Some people thrive when we are divided; we do not want Edo divided anymore as Edo is one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to tell these people who benefit from our division that they should look for another business because we will not be divided. We must now look for ways to organize ourselves properly and rely on ourselves internally,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nResponding on behalf of the newly sworn-in Permanent Secretaries, Mr. Bernard Aigbe, thanked the governor for finding them worthy for the appointment, pledging not to fail in their duties.\n\nAigbe further hailed the governor for providing 24-hour electricity for all government offices in the state through the Ossiomo Power, noting that their appointment was a call to further contribute their quota to the development of the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

They are also to receive, screen and conduct preliminary review proceedings on public and private petitions relating to the subject of this law.\n\n\u201cThe committee has the power to investigate offences which are against the provisions of this law and prosecute offenders who have contravened this law. They are also to make resolutions and set out procedures and other functions as required for them to undertake their activities.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cYou are all witnesses to the rapid urbanization that is taking place and the pressure on communal land. Economic development and growth can only take place in an atmosphere of law and order.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow and accept a situation where people just trespass indiscriminately into other people\u2019s landed properties as it threatens the foundation of our economic existence in the state.\u201d\n\nCharging the committee on improving land administration in the state, Obaseki further stated, \u201cWe have aggregated lots of petitions running into hundreds. We would work with security agencies to ensure that you do the work well and fearlessly; I have spoken with the Inspector General of Police who has given his assurances.\n\n\u201cWe would also work closely with the State Judiciary. If we don\u2019t make convictions, people will not be deterred. I hope the committee will be fearless in the dispensation of justice. Be aware that you have 100 percent backing of the state government and anyone found to disobey this law should face the consequences, no matter how highly placed they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to use this medium to warn those communities that have large stock of arms to terrorize and encroach on other people\u2019s properties; they are fighting a war they can\u2019t win,\u201d the governor warned.\n\nIn her response, the Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Justice Alero Edodo-Eruaga (rtd), noted: \u201cNo investor will put his money in troubled waters. We will ensure peace across the state as it will lead to development, industrialization and create employment opportunities for the youths.\n\n\u201cWe will ensure peace in our communities and state, ensuring that the act of selling people\u2019s land is a thing of the past in Edo.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

And if we continue to practice that for a period of five years to 10 years I believe some of these practices that are catalysing these crises in the sub-region will begin to go down,\u201d Jonathan said.\n\nAccording to him, as part of a strategy to put the development of the region in a fast lane, he said that the region was reconsidering re-capitalizing its regional bank.\n\n\u201cWe also looked at some other things like, we have recommended that the ECOWAS Bank of Investment and Development should be capitalised properly and restructure it so that it will play a key role in assisting people in the private sector to build small and medium scale industries across the sub region. That will increase the opportunity of young people getting loans to develop businesses and also create jobs for others. \u2018\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT",
          "summary": "He noted that, the major challenges African leaders are having is that they have chosen not to work with members of the opposition parties while in office, because they see them as enemies.\n\u201cImmediately you win the election you must be the president of everybody.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cIt is not going to be a one-day business, it is going to be a business that we will do for one year.\nOther members will take over and maybe they will modify our action plan and also move on.\nThat will increase the opportunity of young people getting loans to develop businesses and also create jobs for others.",

          "text": "By Rotimi Ijikanmi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari administration has delivered three critical infrastructure projects, which for decades defied solutions from past administrations of Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola listed the projects on Tuesday in Abuja at the 21st edition of Town Hall Meeting focusing on the achievements of the Federal Government in Infrastructure Development.\n\nThe town hall meeting was organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Orientation Agency (NOA).\n\nIn a presentation, Fashola said that Apapa-Oworonshoki road in Lagos state which was notorious for gridlock and in bad shape for decades was one of the difficult projects.\n\nHe said the road built in 1970 had failed intermittently and seemed to have defied solution in the history of the country.\n\nFashola said Buhari found solution to the critical infrastructure with the construction of a new 37 km road from Apapa Port to the Toll Gate which would last for at least 50 years after completion.\n\nThe minister also identified Bodo-Bonny Bridge in Rivers which was the only access to the site of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas.\n\n\u201cFor decades, this place is only accessible by air and when there is bad weather which are a usual occurrence people cannot get there for days.\n\n\u201cThree attempts had been made by the previous administrations to construct the bridge but all failed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nFashola said the Buhari administration succeeded in constructing the first road and bridge linking Bonny Island in highly challenging environment and soil condition\n\nThe third project according to Fashola is the Second Niger Bridge which he said would be delivered and inaugurated before the end of the year.\n\nThe minister said the second Niger Bridge had always come up as an election statement by past administrations and nothing happened until Buhari broke the jinx.\n\nThe minister said the administration awarded 1,019 infrastructure contracts covering 859 projects across the country and no state was left out without benefitting from the projects.\n\nHe said the administration also took an initiative to fix roads inside federal tertiary institutions and the impact had really worth the efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are in 76 federal tertiary institutions we have completed and commission 29 and starting a round of 22 last year before the ASUU strike.\n\n\u201cOur promise of change as a party and government is manifesting in the area of road transport infrastructure\n\n\u201cThe money we borrowed is being invested in all part of Nigeria and it is driving growth,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "title": "APC Chairmanship: Consensus our best option, Buhari declares",
          "text": "Ahead of its March 26, 2022 national convention, President Muhammadu Buhari has urged governors and chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to explore the option of getting a consensus chairman to run the party\u2019s affairs.\n\nChairman of the APC Governors Forum and Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu said this Tuesday while briefing State House correspondents at the end of a meeting between the APC governors and President Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is a believer in consensus as one of the options of producing leaders and he urged us to explore consensus while recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent but only one person will occupy the office at the end of the day. Consensus is part of our constitution and he urged us to work towards consensus.\n\n\u201cWe have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus; Bisi Akande emerge as the pioneer chairman of the APC through consensus, John Oyegun emerged by consensus, Adama Oshiomhole emerged by consensus. So, the president reminded us of that.\n\n\u201cAnd the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level it\u2019s almost certain that we will achieve it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the APC governors had officially informed the president of the new date for the party\u2019s national convention where officials are expected to be elected.\n\n\u201cThe date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday of their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have had that, we have had the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the proposed zonal congresses which many argued have no provisions in the party\u2019s constitution, the governor said all available options would be looked into.\n\n\u201cI think there has been so much debate. Yesterday, there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn. So, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the Constitution.\n\n\u201cParticularly, how you do zonal congresses? And we have in the past done them with National Convention, but nothing again in the constitution, stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe said contrary to insinuations in some quarters, the APC governors are not divided.\n\n\u201cAre governors divided? Not at all, the 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President, we are appreciative of his leadership, we commend him for his leadership. We are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Kaduna state Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai said the governors were hitherto divided on the issue of timing for the national convention.\n\n\u201cWe were divided over the timing of the convention. Some governors felt we should not have the convention until we resolved all the congresses issues in some states because in some of the states, these matters are even in court.\n\n\u201cSo some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved and that was not borne out of any agenda or selfish interest but just a realistic position to avoid violating any laws or putting our party structures or elected candidates in problem in future.\n\n\u201cBut after our meeting last night to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee and our briefing with the president today, we are all on the same page,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the APC had resolved the zoning formula to be used for national offices of the party.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones and essentially, we swapped the positions such that now northern zone will take positions that the southern zone had in the last eight years and vice-versa.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple, equitable and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of preparing for the convention that will start in earnest,\u201dhe said.\n\nAlso speaking, Plateau state Governor Simon Bako Lalong said the APC would outlive the tenure of President Buhari by remaining in power beyond 2023.\n\nOkorocha\n\nIn a related development, the immediate past governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha has proffered solution to the crisis rocking the APC over repeatedly postponed national convention.\n\nOkorocha, who spoke to Senate correspondents after plenary Tuesday, specifically suggested that founding leaders of the party across the original four blocks should be allowed to nominate interested party members for sensitive positions such as national chairman, secretary, women leader, youth leader, organising secretary etc.\n\nHe said while President Buhari as leader of the Congress for Progress Change (CPC) bloc should be given the honour of deciding who becomes the next national chairman of the party , others like Senator Bola Tinubu of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria(ACN), Ogbonnaya Onu of the defunct All Nigeria People\u2019s Party(ANPP) , himself as leader of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) faction then, should also be giving the honour of picking the national secretary and other important positions.\n\nSharing the party\u2019s positions on that basis, he added , would help in preventing the ship of the party from hitting the rock.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur party is a great party, APC is a great party, what is wrong with our party is that we have forgotten how we all started, we should not make the mistake of PDP of the old and I think that will be corrected with the party\u2019s Convention now slated for March 26 , 2022.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is to go back to basics so that we adhere to the culture of unity and equity the party was known for at formation in 2013.\n\n\u201cThere were four political parties that formed APC. CPC led by the former Head of State, Muhammadu Buhari who is now the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu came with ACN , Governor Abdulaziz Yari , Senator Ali Modu Sheriff (SAS) and former governor of Ebonyi state, Ogbonaya Onu who is now Minister of Science and Technology and Rochas Okorocha leading the APGA.\n\n\u201cOur initial position was that all positions would be shared among these four parties and DPP that came with few members and after the merger, the new PDP joined.\n\n\u201cNow, the wisest thing for all of us to do is to go back to the founding basis and distribute the political positions as we did it that time and there will be no rancour and it will be very peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe father of the party now is President Muhammadu Buhari who should be given that respect to pick the person that will hold sensitive position in the party as Chairman, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu should always be made to produce some key positions in the party and the other parties and should also be made to have positions and when this is done there will be no problem in APC.\n\n\u201cBut if we go into election at this time and of course it will open a Pandora of litigations because where 1000 people buy nominations form, APC can make an income of N2 billion on sales of forms and after that, APC can spend N3 billion on litigations.\n\n\u201cSo the wise thing to do is to call the founding fathers of the party and give them key positions and carry everyone along, including the new people that joined the party.\u201d",

          "title": "Ukraine Mobilises Reserves As Moscow Doubles Down On Demands",
          "text": "Ukraine mobilised its military reserve Wednesday and urged its citizens to leave Russian territory as Moscow sharpened its demands, increasing fears of all-out war.\n\nKremlin chief President Vladimir Putin has defied an avalanche of international sanctions to put his forces on stand-by to occupy two rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn response, Kyiv\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has put Ukraine\u2019s more than 200,000 reservists on notice that they will receive summons to return to their units.\n\nUkraine\u2019s security council also on Wednesday called for a state of emergency in the country \u2014 a measure that still needs to be formally approved by parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine urged its approximately three million citizens living in Russia to leave, as the crisis deepened despite intense international pressure on Moscow, backed by new economic sanctions.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gas Prices \u2018In God\u2019s Hands\u2019, Producers Warn As Ukraine Crisis Sparks Surge\n\nWestern capitals say Russia has amassed 150,000 troops in combat formations on Ukraine\u2019s borders with Russia, Belarus and Russian-occupied Crimean and on warships in the Black Sea.\n\nUkraine has around 200,000 military personnel and Wednesday\u2019s call up could see up to 250,000 reservists aged between 18 and 60 receive their mobilisation papers.\n\nMoscow\u2019s total forces are much larger \u2014 around a million active duty personnel \u2014 and have been modernised and re-armed in recent years.\n\n\u2013 High cost of war \u2013\n\nBut Ukraine has received advanced anti-tank weapons and some drones from NATO members. More have been promised as the allies try to deter a Russian attack or at least make it costly.\n\nShelling has intensified between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists, and civilians living near the front are fearful.\n\nDmitry Maksimenko, a 27-year-old coal miner from government-held Krasnogorivka, told AFP that he was shocked when his wife came to tell him that Putin had recognised two Russian-backed separatist enclaves.\n\n\u201cShe said: \u2018Have you heard the news?\u2019. How could I have known? There\u2019s no electricity never mind internet. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen next, but to be honest, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he said.\n\nWashington and Britain say Russia\u2019s force is poised to strike Ukraine and trigger the most serious war in Europe for decades, but Putin says he is open to negotiation \u2014 within limits.\n\nRussia has demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining the NATO alliance and is seeking to roll back the advance of Western influence in eastern Europe since the Cold War.\n\n\u201cThe interests of Russia, the security of our citizens, are non-negotiable for us,\u201d Putin declared, in a video address to mark the Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday.\n\nREAD ALSO: Germany Can Do Without Russian Gas, Minister Says\n\nOn Tuesday, the Federation Council, Russia\u2019s upper house, gave him unanimous approval to deploy troops to two breakaway Ukrainian regions now recognised by Moscow as independent, Donetsk and Lugansk.\n\nRussia said it had established diplomatic relations \u201cat the level of embassies\u201d with the separatist statelets, which broke away from Kyiv in 2014 in a conflict that cost more than 14,000 lives.\n\nMoscow also said it would evacuate diplomatic personnel from Ukraine to \u201cprotect their lives.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Putin on Tuesday set out a number of stringent conditions if the West wanted to de-escalate the crisis, saying Ukraine should drop its NATO ambition and become neutral.\n\nUS President Joe Biden later announced tough new sanctions against Russia for \u201cbeginning\u201d an invasion of Ukraine, but said there was still time to avoid war.\n\nJapan and Australia followed suit early Wednesday with their own stringent penalties for Moscow and individuals connected with the aggression against Ukraine.\n\nBiden announced what he called the \u201cfirst tranche\u201d of sanctions, including steps to starve Russia of financing and target financial institutions and the country\u2019s \u201celites\u201d.\n\nBut he left the door open to a final effort at diplomacy to avert a full-scale Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that Russia is the aggressor, so we\u2019re clear-eyed about the challenges we\u2019re facing,\u201d the US leader said.\n\nBiden\u2019s address followed a wave of sanctions announced by Britain and the European Union, after Putin recognised the self-declared Donetsk and Lugansk separatist regions this week.\n\nGermany also announced it was halting certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Full-scale invasion\u2019 \u2013\n\nKremlin officials have responded scornfully to the sanctions, and observers point out that energy-rich Russia has huge reserves of $639 billion and an $182-billion sovereign wealth fund to see it through a crisis.\n\nPutin\u2019s plans remain unclear, but Western officials have been warning for weeks he has been preparing an all-out invasion of Ukraine, a move that could spark a catastrophic war in Europe.\n\nThe White House signalled it no longer believes Russia is serious about avoiding conflict, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov scheduled for Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Putin said that Moscow had recognised the independence of Ukraine\u2019s separatist regions within their administrative borders, including territory still controlled by Kyiv \u2014 raising the spectre of a clash.\n\nHe added that Western-brokered peace agreements on Ukraine\u2019s conflict no longer existed and stressed that the deployment of Russian troops would \u201cdepend on the specific situation\u2026 on the ground.\u201d\n\nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had \u201cevery indication\u201d that Moscow \u201ccontinues to plan for a full-scale attack on Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBritish foreign minister Liz Truss told Sky News it was \u201clikely\u201d that Putin would \u201cfollow through on his plan for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine\u201d.",

          "title": "ECOWAS Rejects Mali\u2019s Five-year Transition Proposal",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former President and Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Council of the Wise (CoW), Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has said the sub-region would not accept the five-year transition period proposed by the military government in Mali because it is too long.\n\nJonathan, who is also ECOWAS Chief Mediator on the Mali crisis, said military regimes had become an aberration in the sub-region and could no longer be tolerated.\n\nHe spoke on Tuesday in Lagos during a press conference at the end of a two-day strategic retreat of the ECOWAS Council of the Wise.\n\nJonathan stressed that the proposal for a five-year transition period for the military regime by the Malian parliament was unacceptable because the time was not only too long, but also untenable.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cIf the parliament approves that, I don\u2019t believe ECOWAS will accept it. I cannot say authoritatively because I am not the chair of the Authority of ECOWAS, but because I am the mediator, we feel that five years is too long for a transitional government. In 2012, when we had a similar experience in Mali, it was one and a half years within which elections were done, when the former speaker of parliament became the interim president.\n\n\u201cAnd within one and a half years elections were done. Niger, of course, that was 2011, when I was still head of state, when the military intervention happened, it was within 12 months, elections were conducted. We had a similar case in Burkina Faso within that period; within 12 months elections were conducted.\n\n\u201cWe believe that ECOWAS does not want any coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the sub-region anyway. But assuming it happens, we believe that the period they will hold office should not be so long.\n\n\u201cIn this February, they have spent about one and a half years already. Adding another five years is six and a half years. ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State will discuss it, but I believe ECOWAS may not accept it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to negotiate it further with them and see that they reduce it because five years plus one and a half years, that is six and a half years, it is almost two tenures of an elected government. And I think for a transitional government it does not really add up.\u201d\n\nJonathan said as part of a strategy to quicken the development of the region, ECOWAS was considering re-capitalisation of its regional bank.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe also looked at some other things, like we have recommended that the ECOWAS Bank of Investment and Development should be capitalised properly and restructured so that it will play a key role in terms of assisting people in the private sector to build small and medium scale industries across the sub-region.\n\n\u201cThat will increase the opportunity of young people getting loans to develop businesses and also create jobs for others. So we looked at other things, but basically none of these will bring immediate answer to a situation in a place like Mali. Already, the military are there and they want to stay for another five years. So that should be through negotiation, which the council of the wise will work with the commission, we will work with the Authority of Heads of State and Government to get that done.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo when you now raise the issue of Mali parliament that have approved the five-year term transition, the parliament of Mali is a part of the government of Mali that is in operation. They are not elected members of the parliament and that is why ECOWAS parliament won\u2019t even accept them to meet with the ECOWAS parliament.

We have three countries being run by the military, which is an aberration in the sub-region.\n\n\u201cBut the main reason for the council of the wise is to come up with different ways that we should be doing things to reduce such infraction in our democratic setting. So that is the first.\n\n\u201cWe will also make suggestions, but the council of the wise is mainly persuasive. It is like an organ of ECOWAS that will come up with advisory programmes and policies that will help the commission and, indeed, the Authority of Heads of State and Government to handle some of these issues.\u201d\n\nJonathan said his council recommended for the region free and compulsory education for all children from primary to secondary school level as part of efforts to ensure that young people were no longer easily recruited into evil agenda.\n\nJonathan said the issue of bad leaders whose actions and inactions lead to crisis in their countries was also being looked into.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Citing Emergence of Previous Chairmen, Buhari Okays Consensus for APC Convention",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, met with governors elected on the platform of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and okayed suggestions for a consensus option at the newly proposed March 26 national convention of the party.\n\nBuhari met with the APC governors at the State House, Abuja, for about 15 minutes and discussed the current state of the party and the misgivings about its national convention. He noted that all former chairmen of APC, from Chief Bisi Akande, John Odigie-Oyegun, to Adams Oshiomhole, emerged through consensus.\n\nBut Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, dismissed insinuations that the 22 governors of APC and the Anambra State Deputy Governor were sharply divided over the date of the national convention, saying they merely disagreed. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen after the APC governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari, however, noted that the governors had disagreed over the timing of the national convention, as some were of the belief that there were many unresolved issues. But he contended that they were all now on the same page.\n\nEl-Rufai said APC had adopted a formula, which was embraced by the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during its convention. Under the plan, APC would allow its northern and southern members swap positions from the ones held by the previous National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nJudging by the copy of the zoning formula obtained by THISDAY last night, APC had resolved to have its national chairman come from the North-central, while conceding the office of National Secretary to the South-west.\n\nDespite its recent challenges, Chairman of Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, allayed concerns that the ruling party might collapse after Buhari\u2019s tenure. Lalong believed APC would be stronger after the incumbent president.\n\nEl-Rufai, who was fielding questions from State House correspondents, said the governors had disagreed over the timing of the convention, because, \u201cThere were some governors that felt we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress issues in some states.\n\n\u201cAs you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.\n\n\u201cYes, there were differences in opinions about timing. Some of us are saying the constitution allows us to have convention even if three or four states have issues that are unresolved, while others are saying no, let us finish all the reconciliations and we do this convention. After all, there is no time limit for the convention as long as we do it before the time for the primaries.\n\n\u201cSo, that was the difference. This is what the media has called divided governors. In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra State agreeing on any issue.\n\n\u201cWe can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we are all on the same page.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna State governor also disclosed that APC had agreed on a zoning formula that would swap offices previously held between North and South.\n\nBy the arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last NWC will go to the South, and vice versa, in the coming dispensation.\n\nEl-Rufai affirmed that agreement had been reached on zoning.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south has had in the last NWC, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also after their meeting with Buhari, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, revealed that Buhari was in favour of consensus in selecting candidates for party offices.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cOn consensus, Mr. President reminded us that we have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus: Baba Akande emerged as the pioneer chairman of the party by consensus; His Excellency, John Oyegun emerged by consensus; His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole emerged by consensus.\n\n\u201cSo, he is a believer in consensus as one of the options for producing leadership, and he urged us to explore consensus, so that we can generate a list. While recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent, but knowing that just one person will occupy the office, consensus is part of our constitution, and he urged us to work towards consensus.\n\n\u201cAnd the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level; it\u2019s almost certain that we will achieve it.\n\n\u201cThen, the date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday on their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have heard the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position.\u201d\n\nBagudu explained that even though the planned zonal congresses of APC were not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOn proposed zonal congresses not in the constitution, I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday (Monday), there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn.\n\n\u201cSo, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the constitution, particularly, how you do zonal congresses. And we have in the past done them with national convention, but nothing again in the constitution stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC governors were divided, Bagudu retorted, \u201cAre governors divided? Not at all! The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President; we are appreciative of his leadership. We commend him for his leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Lalong maintained that the ruling party would not collapse after Buhari\u2019s exit, saying, \u201cI think that from the progress report read by our chairman, and from several assumptions, and also several reports that we are seeing what tremendous efforts the federal government is doing. We are already going around commissioning projects here and there in all the various states.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, although, you are not specific as to which reason will make us not to come back again, but as far as we are concerned, based on assessment, and based on what the federal government is doing, there is every hope that this party, this government will move beyond our president and that is what he has been saying, that by the grace of God, this government will move beyond his tenure.\u201d\n\nNineteen of the 22 APC governors were in attendance at the meeting held at the Council Chambers, which also had in attendance Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nThe governors in attendance were those of Yobe, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Cross River, Kaduna, Lagos, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Kano, Imo, Kogi, Ogun, Plateau and Anambra\u2019s deputy governor.\n\nZoning Formula\n\nAccording to the zoning formula obtained yesterday by THISDAY, APC has zoned its chairmanship position to North-central, which implies that the presidential ticket of the party might go to the south, in addition to the office of the National Secretary, which has been given to the South-west in specific.\n\nOther positions zoned to the North-central are National Vice Chairman (NC), Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nAPC zoned the following positions to the South-south: National Vice Chairman (SS), National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader\n\nThe offices zoned to the South-west are National Secretary, National Vice Chairman (South-West), National Youth Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nFor the North-west, the positions given are National Vice Chairman (NW), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability \u2013 PWD) Leader, among others.\n\nThe party zoned the position of the Deputy National Chairman (S) to the South-east, with other offices like National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nNorth-east would produce Deputy National Chairman (N), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (NW), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, among others.\n\nInterestingly, the zoning plan has tactically knocked out a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and Sunny Monidafe.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants favoured by the method are the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Musa; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; and former governors of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura and Abdudulahi Adamu.\n\nBuni Threatens to Resign\n\nBut while APC may have succeeded in dousing the raging issues over its national convention, a new problem seems to be developing.\n\nAn insider told THISDAY last night that the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had threatened to resign his position, citing accusations of inefficiency from many APC governors accused.\n\nThe source said regarding Buni, \u201cWhile some of the governors were ready to grab his resignation, others cautioned that accepting his resignation would draw the party back. And on the basis of that, the governors encouraged him to continue until the national convention is held.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the governors and the president agreed to swap offices between North and South, THISDAY gathered that the leaders of the party specifically agreed that the national chairman should go to the North-central.\n\nAccording to the source, while the party\u2019s leaders agreed on consensus option in electing the national officers, the governors agreed that the president should be given the privilege to pick the national chairman.\n\nThus, ahead of the national convention on March 26, the meeting yesterday also agreed to hold national caucus meeting to resolve all pending issues.\n\nAPC EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL CONVENTION 2022\n\nZONING OF NATIONAL OFFICES\n\nSOUTH-SOUTH:\n\n(Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River,\n\nDelta, Edo and Rivers States)\n\n1.

          "text": "Nigeria and Iraq have said the strategy employed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to gradually raise oil production is enough to balance the market.\n\nBoth countries insisted that there was no need for OPEC to be more aggressive, despite crude oil surge this year to almost $100 a barrel.\n\nThe 23-nation alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, would meet on March 2 to decide the next line of action in terms of the amount of oil it expected members to pump in April.\n\nBloomberg quoted Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, as maintaining that the international cartel would not need to take any unplanned barrels to the market, stressing that the current plan perfectly serves the market as it is.\n\nSylva told reporters at an event in Doha, Qatar, according to Bloomberg, \u201cWe won\u2019t do anything extraordinary at this time because we are expecting a lot of production from outside of OPEC+.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s no need at all to bring on more barrels than the current plan. We are expecting more production if a nuclear deal with Iran works out (since) there will be production from them.\u201d\n\nSeveral of OPEC+\u2019s biggest producers want to continue to add 400,000 barrels a day of crude to the market each month, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn addition, Iraq\u2019s Ihsan Jabbar said OPEC and its partners would make their decision for April at the March meeting, after reviewing fresh data on supply and demand.\n\nThe comments came even as Brent crude rose 2.3 per cent to $97.60 a barrel, extending this year\u2019s jump to 26 per cent.\n\nTuesday\u2019s gain occurred after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he was recognising two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Ukraine.\n\nIraq\u2019s energy minister, Jabbar, said OPEC was factoring in growth in output from non-OPEC+ members, such as Brazil and Canada, and did not want to see any increase in commercially-stored oil around the world.\n\n\u201cThe market will have more and more oil so we think there\u2019s no need\u201d to deviate from today\u2019s strategy, Jabbar said in an interview in Qatar, where he was attending a natural gas conference, together with Sylva and others.\n\n\u201cWe will not create any growth to the commercial storage. We will secure all the demand by making the required supply,\u201d he added.\n\nRussia, a major oil and gas producer, plans to send \u201cpeacekeeping forces\u201d to the Ukrainian region in a dramatic escalation of the on-going conflict. Moscow has consistently denied having plans to invade Ukraine.\n\nSome major oil importers have called on OPEC+ to pump faster and put pressure on the likes of Saudi Arabia to use up some of their spare capacity.\n\nJabbar said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d for any OPEC+ state to raise output beyond its quota, despite many members struggling to reach theirs.\n\nNigeria has been struggling to meet its OPEC allocation for months and has as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels\u2019 output allowed by the organisation, the country has managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nAlthough there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country\u2019s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nLast week, the International Agency Energy Agency (IEA), which advises rich countries, said OPEC+ was pumping almost one million barrels a day below its target.\n\n\u201cWe have come from the recovery from COVID,\u201d the Iraqi minister said.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair that you will give the increase just for some countries,\u201d he added.\n\nIraq undershot its output target last month because of bad weather at ports, Jabbar said. The country should meet its quota for February of around 4.3 million barrels a day, he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive of Vitol, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil traders, expects oil prices to climb to $100 and remain at that level for an extended period of time.\n\nThis bullish prediction, he said, was driven by a belief that global demand would surge in the second half of the year and could surpass 100 million barrels per day.\n\nOn the supply side, he said it was the fear of shrinking spare production capacity and restraint from US shale that was driving oil prices higher. Oil prices will go higher, and they would stay there for an extended period of time, said the chief executive of Vitol, Russell Hardy.\n\n\u201cThe 100 million-barrel number is probably going to be exceeded this year,\u201d Hardy told Bloomberg, adding, \u201cDemand is going to surge in the second half.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, demand for crude this year could surpass 100 million barrels daily.\n\nLike many others, Vitol\u2019s chief executive noted that the imbalance in global oil markets was fuelling inflation and threatening to interfere with the recovery of the global economy from the fallout of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, more oil does not seem to be coming, as the US and European super majors are focusing on shareholder returns instead of production growth, and national oil companies in the OPEC+ countries are sticking to their original plan of adding 400,000 bpd to total production every month.\n\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to run out of spare capacity. That\u2019s what the market is trying to work out,\u201d Hardy noted.\n\nMajor Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, had already recently predicted that prices would hit $100 a barrel.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

Bryan was not charged with a weapons offense. The hate-crimes felony, the most serious of the charges the defendants faced, carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.

          "text": "Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and threatened to go further if Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its neighbour.\n\nThe United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan announced plans to target banks and elites while Germany halted a major gas pipeline project from Russia in one of the worst security crises in Europe in decades.\n\nBitter about Ukraine\u2019s long-term goal to join NATO and claiming it as historic Russian land, Russian President Vladimir Putin has amassed more than 150,000 troops near Ukraine\u2019s borders, according to U.S. estimates, and ordered soldiers into the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d.\n\nThe United States dismisses that justification as \u201cnonsense\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo put it simply Russia just announced that it is carving out a big chunk of Ukraine,\u201d U.S. Presidnt Joe Biden said on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is the beginning of a Russian invasion.\u201d\n\nSatellite imagery over the past 24 hours shows several new troop and equipment deployments in western Russia and more than 100 vehicles at a small airfield in southern Belarus, which borders Ukraine, according to U.S. firm Maxar.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said early on Wednesday one soldier had been killed and six wounded in 96 incidents of shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east over the previous 24 hours. It said separatist forces used heavy artillery, mortars and Grad rocket systems.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian cancelled separate scheduled meetings with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday as weeks of frantic diplomacy failed to end the crisis.\n\nPlans announced by Biden to bolster Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania include sending 800 infantry soldiers and up to eight F-35 fighter jets to locations along NATO\u2019s eastern flank, a U.S. official said, but are a redistribution, not additions.\n\nPutin did not watch Biden\u2019s speech and Russia will first look at what the United States has outlined before responding, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, cited by Russian news agencies.\n\nPutin said he was always open to finding diplomatic solutions but that \u201cthe interests of Russia and the security of our citizens are unconditional for us.\u201d\n\nMoscow is calling for security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO, while the United States and its allies offer Putin confidence-building and arms control steps to defuse the stand-off.\n\nLavrov brushed off the threat of sanctions.\n\n\u201cOur European, American, British colleagues will not stop and will not calm down until they have exhausted all their possibilities for the so-called punishment of Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nGAS PIPELINE HALTED\n\nIn perhaps the most significant measure announced on Tuesday, Germany halted the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline owned by Russian state-owned gas giant Gazprom , a move likely to raise gas prices in Europe.\n\nBuilt and awaiting German approval, the pipeline had been set to ease the pressure on European consumers facing record energy prices but critics including the United States have long argued it would increase Europe\u2019s energy dependence on Russia.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned that gas prices in Europe were likely to rise in the short term. Dmitry Medvedev, Russia\u2019s former president and now deputy chairman of its Security Council, suggested prices could double.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros per thousand cubic metres!\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nThe Kremlin said it hoped the Nord Stream delay was temporary and Putin said Russia \u201caims to continue uninterrupted supplies\u201d of energy to the world.\n\nU.S. sanctions target Russian elites and two state-owned banks, excluding them from the U.S. banking system, banning them from trading with Americans, and freezing their U.S. assets. They also seek to deny the Russian government access to Western financing.\n\nThe U.S. sanctions applied to VEB bank and Russia\u2019s military bank, Promsvyazbank, which does defence deals. Russia\u2019s two largest commercial lenders, Sberbank and VTB, would face American sanctions if Moscow proceeded with its invasion of Ukraine, a U.S. official said.\n\nBiden said that while more sanctions were being prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, it was critical to ensure such measures did not hurt Americans in the form of steeper energy costs.\n\nCrude oil futures on Tuesday reached their highest levels since 2014. A U.S. State Department official said sanctions that could be imposed in the near future \u201cwill not target oil and gas flows\u201d.\n\nBritain announced sanctions on three billionaires with close links to Putin, and five smaller lenders including Promsvyazbank.\n\nThe European Union has agreed to blacklist banks involved in financing separatists in eastern Ukraine and to cut the Russian government out of its debt markets. read more",
