          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nFor Barrister Ayodele Fasanya, 58, the only thing that matters now is how to raise money to get a kidney transplant. Fasanya battling stage five chronic kidney disease has been hospitalised at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital since November. Even though he has been receiving palliative care and undergoing regular dialysis, he said only a kidney transplant that doctors say will cost a whopping N17m can help him have his life back. LARA ADEJORO reports:\n\nAyodele Fasanya says he still remembers the days he used to be active and vibrant in legal practice. He said he still hopes to complete his PhD in Law to become a consultant. But, his legal practice and PhD dream are all on hold as he battles chronic kidney disease.\n\nFasanya said he did not know that what started as a mild illness would degenerate into a stage five Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\nStage five CKD, according to experts, occurs when the estimated glomerular filtration rate falls below 15, indicating that the kidneys are failing or close to failing.\n\nHis doctors have told him that he would need a kidney transplant to increase his chances of living a longer, healthier life.\n\nAccording to Fasanya, his health challenges started during a routine medical checkup in the year 2000. He said that was when he got the news that he had high blood pressure.\n\nHe said that he started attending a private hospital for treatment from 2001 to 2011, adding that he was placed on medication. He, however, stated that no one discovered that his kidney has been affected.\n\n\u201cMy serious ailment then has been gastric arthritis, my uric level was quite high and it affects my mobility because I was quite an active and busy person and what I do was to use painkillers and I later got to know that the Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not good for the kidney,\u201d he recalls.\n\nMeanwhile, during a proceeding in court, he slumped and was rushed to the General Hospital, Ikorodu but was later referred to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cAt LASUTH, I came in as a rheumatology patient but when I was doing some tests, they found out that my creatinine level was unusually high and it indicates there\u2019s a problem with the kidney.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was referred to a nephrologist, the first test showed that I had stage three chronic kidney disease. As soon as I heard that, I got panicked and I begin to self-audit to control and live a healthy style, I cut off animal protein, plant protein, salt but again, I had underlying cholesterol but I controlled it.\n\nChronic Kidney Disease is a condition characterised by a gradual loss of kidney function over time and it can lead to kidney failure.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent who visited him at his ward in LASUTH, Fasanya said \u201cFor a while, I was fine without any issue but by the time I came for a check-up again, it has advanced to CKD stage four.\n\n\u201cBut then, doing my PhD in law became tasking in addition to the legal practice. Two months ago, after I had written my exam, I just found out that I became numb immediately after I came home.

I appreciate everyone who has given their widow\u2019s mite to commence the initial treatment and I still appeal for more funds,\u201d he told our correspondent.\n\nA 2018 bulletin published by the World Health Organisation showed that a range of communicable and non-communicable diseases result in renal complications and many people who have kidney disease lack access to care.\n\nIt added that a multisectoral approach is needed to tackle the global burden of kidney disease and the sustainable development goals emphasise the importance of a multisectoral approach to health.\n\nThe Global Burden of Disease 2015 study also estimated that, in 2015, 1.2 million people died from kidney failure, an increase of 32 percent since 2005 and in 2010, an estimated 2.3\u20137; while one million people with end-stage kidney disease died without access to chronic dialysis.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, each year, around 1.7 million people are thought to die from acute kidney injury.

          "text": "Toluwalope Kareem\n\nA consultant pediatrician/pediatric nephrologist with Zenith Medical and Kidney Centre Abuja, Dr. Chukwunonso Epundu, discusses bedwetting or enuresis, in this interview with TOLUWALOPE KAREEM\n\nWhat is bedwetting?\n\nBedwetting or enuresis, in general, means the unintentional passage of urine, usually by children, but it can also happen in adults, where the person urinates into their clothes. It can occur during the day or at night. When it occurs at night, it is called nocturnal enuresis.\n\nWhat are the causes of bedwetting?\n\nThe major cause can be divided into two major categories; we have organic and inorganic causes. For inorganic, the causes cannot be pinpointed or related to something particularly medical; most times it is psychological. This is the type typical with children. Mostly, it is a psychological thing, the children are otherwise normal, nothing is wrong with them medically. More than 80 per cent of children that are bedwetting fall under the inorganic condition.\n\nFor organic, the causes can be related to something that is identified as a medical problem. In this case, if you treat the condition, the bedwetting itself would stop. This is not as common as the inorganic type.\n\nAt what age is a child expected to stop bedwetting?\n\nBefore one can actually establish bedwetting, one has to have reached the age of expected continence. Continence means the ability to control one\u2019s urge to urinate, whether one is sleeping or awake. Daytime continence is usually attained at age three, whereby if the child wants to urinate, he or she would be able to say so. But, of course, some children attain continence earlier, around age two or even one plus. But at three years every child is expected to have attained daytime continence. If that is not the case, then the parent or guardian may be concerned.\n\nFor nocturnal continence, it is usually attained between ages five and seven. Within this period a child should have attained night-time or nocturnal continence; the child should be able to wake up from sleep by themselves to go to the toilet to urinate. But, of course, some children may attain that earlier. It is after this stage that a parent or guardian may begin to get a little worried and see a pediatrician.\n\nIf a child does not stop bedwetting at age seven, what are the possible causes?\n\nWe have primary and secondary bedwetting. Primary bedwetting is when a child has never attained continence at any point in time since he or she was born. Secondary bedwetting is when a child may have attained continence, stopped bedwetting at night for at least about six months and then suddenly starts bedwetting again.\n\nFor the first instance, where the child is primarily bedwetting and has never attained continence, a lot of factors could be responsible, including psychological factors where the child hasn\u2019t been able to understand or master when the urge to urinate comes and to get up to go to the toilet. In this case, such a child needs to be tutored appropriately.\n\nThe other aspect is that some children have a smaller bladder than others; so when they take plenty of fluids, especially in the evening, they may end up filling their bladder faster and they may find themselves bedwetting.\n\nAlso, it can be due to environmental factors. For instance, the toilet may be a bit far from where they are and they may find it difficult or feel reluctant to get up and go use the toilet.\n\nVery importantly, structurally or genetically, for a child who is bedwetting, one of the parents often may have had such a problem when they were young. Such parents may not say it, but that is a simple truth. For such parents, they should show understanding and address the problem in the way it was addressed in their own time, and help the child to overcome the condition, without making the child feel bad.\n\nFor secondary incontinence, when the child has stopped bedwetting but suddenly starts again after about six months, something unusual must have happened; it could be a change of environment, it could also be as a result of a psychological stressor, such as change of school, teachers, etc. It could be that something happened in the child\u2019s school that they did not discuss with their parents and is stressing them up; maybe they are overworked in the house and end up sleeping so tired and unable to wake up to visit the toilet to urinate.\n\nThere are also factors like urinary tract infection and they are unable to hold back urine. In such an instance, it is now the job of the doctor and parent to explore all potential problems, identify them and possibly treat such and recover.\n\nWhat are the causes of bedwetting in adults?\n\nWhen an adult is bedwetting, there are factors one will consider. You have to look at the nervous system; it could have something to do with a stroke because from the brain to the spinal cord anything could have happened; a cardiac problem, genital system. If the person had an accident and lost control of the bladder, that can equally lead to incontinence. Infection can also be a problem and not allow the person to hold urine very well. If a person has diabetes, for instance, such a person may not be able to get up all the time to urinate and that can lead to leakage of urine on the bed and that is bedwetting.\n\nOther things such as prostate enlargement in men can lead to urine retention in the bladder and leakage of urine. Age on its own can be a factor, when a person is very old it may lead to an inability to control the urge to urinate. Other things, such as cancer, can also be responsible, particularly when some nerves are affected.\n\nHow is bedwetting diagnosed?\n\nDiagnosis most of the time has to do with taking a good history from the parents of the child, telling the doctor what is happening to their child. The doctor will look at the age, the factors and sometimes it may require little reassurance from the doctor and that may be enough.\n\nWhen the doctor looks at the factors, age and what the parents have described and what they may have tried to do, the doctor will be able to establish whether the child should have attained continence and say whether it is something to be worried about or not.\n\nIf the doctor thinks it\u2019s primary bedwetting, then he will make recommendations on what to do. Most of the time, you will realise that it is a psychological thing that needs to be addressed, but if the doctor identifies a problem, then there will be treatment. Diagnosis is mostly from the history given.\n\nHow best can the situation be handled?\n\nIf it is organic, that needs to be treated and given some time. For instance, if there is a urinary tract infection, you treat it until the person recovers and bedwetting stops; but when it is a psychological problem, you have to do a lot of counselling for the parents. Because the way and manner the parents handle the issue with the child can go a long way in the way the child overcomes the problem.\n\nFor instance, if the child is examined and it is found that nothing is wrong structurally or medically, you need to explain to the parents that it may take a while for the child to overcome this, the child requires a lot of support psychologically so that the child will not suffer from low self-esteem.\n\nMost of the time parents are very aggressive and sometimes abusive when trying to deal with it, which is wrong. Let the child take responsibility for bedwetting, especially when the child knows that bedwetting is wrong; also allow the child to take part in the cleaning process so that he or she would not want to do that over again. It is not a time to beat the child, let the child know that he or she is not alone and you will all overcome it.\n\nYou can also let the child know that there is a genetic background to it; that one of the parents had such as a child so that the child can feel a sense of support from the family. Also, watch the amount of water the child takes at night before going to bed; intake of carbonated drinks should also be reduced. You should not discuss the child\u2019s bedwetting in public, it shouldn\u2019t be a public affair; a child should not have to suffer such low self-esteem because of bedwetting.\n\nFor some children, sleeping in an air-conditioned environment makes a room so cold and they may not want to go and ease themselves. As parents, you should make it easier for them to want to go and use the toilet by themselves by creating a good lighting system around the bathroom so that they can be able to ease themselves comfortably when they wake up.\n\nAnother thing parents can do to help is what we call parental timing, which should last for about six weeks. It involves waking the child up to ease themselves, and over time the child gets used to that timing. If all this fails, there is something called a bed alarm, once the child wears it and wants to ease themselves and the urine touches it, the alarm rings or vibrates and wakes the child up. When all these fail, the doctor can prescribe drugs to control the bladder. But the pediatrician has to be sure because that is the last option. Also, you could encourage a reward system for your child.\n\nFor adults, most of the time you already know that it is an organic problem, so you find the root of the problem and solve it. For instance, if it is diabetes, when you treat it with medications, the blood sugar will come down and frequent urination will reduce. Most of the time in adults, you know the cause and you treat it and bedwetting will go. Some adults are bedwetting even without organic factors, they have had it going on with them for such a long time, right from childhood till adult, they\u2019ll need to see a nephrologist to evaluate them; they may also need to see a psychologist that will evaluate them properly if it is inorganic.\n\nIn adults, bedwetting can be particularly embarrassing. The person cannot just stay back in the house and wallow in shame without seeking medical help. It could just be a situation where the muscle of the bladder is unstable. Some medications may just be enough to solve the problem.\n\nAre there different treatments for bedwetting in children and adults?\n\nMost of the time for children, the issue is not organic, it tends to be more of an inorganic treatment you give to them; you offer a non-medical treatment to them. But for adults, the case is often organic; so you give them medical treatment.\n\nPeople say bedwetting has some spiritual connection. How true is this?\n\nI do not agree with them. From our point of view, there is nothing spiritual about it. It is something that has a root cause and can be traced. If it is not organic or medical in nature, then it is psychology and in such cases, it just needs to be addressed.\n\nAlso, genetic causes based on parental history as well cannot be debunked or overlooked, but the only thing is that most times parents may not divulge that they also had the issue when they were younger. You cannot blame the parents, because of the shame they faced when they were children, so they don\u2019t want the child to experience it; so they may become more aggressive for the child to stop it early enough.\n\nPeople say when you cross over fire it may stop bedwetting. How true is this?\n\nIt is not true, there is no relationship between fire and bedwetting, and all those things are conjectures and superstitious beliefs that have no scientific basis. If the right thing is done, and the right approach is taken, the child will eventually stop bedwetting.",

When it occurs at night, it is called nocturnal enuresis.\n\nWhat are the causes of bedwetting?\n\nThe major cause can be divided into two major categories; we have organic and inorganic causes. For inorganic, the causes cannot be pinpointed or related to something particularly medical; most times it is psychological. This is the type typical with children. Mostly, it is a psychological thing, the children are otherwise normal, nothing is wrong with them medically. More than 80 per cent of children that are bedwetting fall under the inorganic condition.\n\nFor organic, the causes can be related to something that is identified as a medical problem. In this case, if you treat the condition, the bedwetting itself would stop. This is not as common as the inorganic type.\n\nAt what age is a child expected to stop bedwetting?\n\nBefore one can actually establish bedwetting, one has to have reached the age of expected continence. Continence means the ability to control one\u2019s urge to urinate, whether one is sleeping or awake. Daytime continence is usually attained at age three, whereby if the child wants to urinate, he or she would be able to say so. But, of course, some children attain continence earlier, around age two or even one plus. But at three years every child is expected to have attained daytime continence. If that is not the case, then the parent or guardian may be concerned.\n\nFor nocturnal continence, it is usually attained between ages five and seven. Within this period a child should have attained night-time or nocturnal continence; the child should be able to wake up from sleep by themselves to go to the toilet to urinate. But, of course, some children may attain that earlier. It is after this stage that a parent or guardian may begin to get a little worried and see a pediatrician.\n\nIf a child does not stop bedwetting at age seven, what are the possible causes?\n\nWe have primary and secondary bedwetting. Primary bedwetting is when a child has never attained continence at any point in time since he or she was born. Secondary bedwetting is when a child may have attained continence, stopped bedwetting at night for at least about six months and then suddenly starts bedwetting again.\n\nFor the first instance, where the child is primarily bedwetting and has never attained continence, a lot of factors could be responsible, including psychological factors where the child hasn\u2019t been able to understand or master when the urge to urinate comes and to get up to go to the toilet. In this case, such a child needs to be tutored appropriately.\n\nThe other aspect is that some children have a smaller bladder than others; so when they take plenty of fluids, especially in the evening, they may end up filling their bladder faster and they may find themselves bedwetting.\n\nAlso, it can be due to environmental factors. For instance, the toilet may be a bit far from where they are and they may find it difficult or feel reluctant to get up and go use the toilet.\n\nVery importantly, structurally or genetically, for a child who is bedwetting, one of the parents often may have had such a problem when they were young. Such parents may not say it, but that is a simple truth. For such parents, they should show understanding and address the problem in the way it was addressed in their own time, and help the child to overcome the condition, without making the child feel bad.\n\nFor secondary incontinence, when the child has stopped bedwetting but suddenly starts again after about six months, something unusual must have happened; it could be a change of environment, it could also be as a result of a psychological stressor, such as change of school, teachers, etc. It could be that something happened in the child\u2019s school that they did not discuss with their parents and is stressing them up; maybe they are overworked in the house and end up sleeping so tired and unable to wake up to visit the toilet to urinate.\n\nThere are also factors like urinary tract infection and they are unable to hold back urine. In such an instance, it is now the job of the doctor and parent to explore all potential problems, identify them and possibly treat such and recover.\n\nWhat are the causes of bedwetting in adults?\n\nWhen an adult is bedwetting, there are factors one will consider. You have to look at the nervous system; it could have something to do with a stroke because from the brain to the spinal cord anything could have happened; a cardiac problem, genital system. If the person had an accident and lost control of the bladder, that can equally lead to incontinence. Infection can also be a problem and not allow the person to hold urine very well. If a person has diabetes, for instance, such a person may not be able to get up all the time to urinate and that can lead to leakage of urine on the bed and that is bedwetting.\n\nOther things such as prostate enlargement in men can lead to urine retention in the bladder and leakage of urine. Age on its own can be a factor, when a person is very old it may lead to an inability to control the urge to urinate. Other things, such as cancer, can also be responsible, particularly when some nerves are affected.\n\nHow is bedwetting diagnosed?\n\nDiagnosis most of the time has to do with taking a good history from the parents of the child, telling the doctor what is happening to their child. The doctor will look at the age, the factors and sometimes it may require little reassurance from the doctor and that may be enough.\n\nWhen the doctor looks at the factors, age and what the parents have described and what they may have tried to do, the doctor will be able to establish whether the child should have attained continence and say whether it is something to be worried about or not.\n\nIf the doctor thinks it\u2019s primary bedwetting, then he will make recommendations on what to do. Most of the time, you will realise that it is a psychological thing that needs to be addressed, but if the doctor identifies a problem, then there will be treatment. Diagnosis is mostly from the history given.\n\nHow best can the situation be handled?\n\nIf it is organic, that needs to be treated and given some time. For instance, if there is a urinary tract infection, you treat it until the person recovers and bedwetting stops; but when it is a psychological problem, you have to do a lot of counselling for the parents. Because the way and manner the parents handle the issue with the child can go a long way in the way the child overcomes the problem.\n\nFor instance, if the child is examined and it is found that nothing is wrong structurally or medically, you need to explain to the parents that it may take a while for the child to overcome this, the child requires a lot of support psychologically so that the child will not suffer from low self-esteem.\n\nMost of the time parents are very aggressive and sometimes abusive when trying to deal with it, which is wrong. Let the child take responsibility for bedwetting, especially when the child knows that bedwetting is wrong; also allow the child to take part in the cleaning process so that he or she would not want to do that over again. It is not a time to beat the child, let the child know that he or she is not alone and you will all overcome it.\n\nYou can also let the child know that there is a genetic background to it; that one of the parents had such as a child so that the child can feel a sense of support from the family. Also, watch the amount of water the child takes at night before going to bed; intake of carbonated drinks should also be reduced. You should not discuss the child\u2019s bedwetting in public, it shouldn\u2019t be a public affair; a child should not have to suffer such low self-esteem because of bedwetting.\n\nFor some children, sleeping in an air-conditioned environment makes a room so cold and they may not want to go and ease themselves. As parents, you should make it easier for them to want to go and use the toilet by themselves by creating a good lighting system around the bathroom so that they can be able to ease themselves comfortably when they wake up.\n\nAnother thing parents can do to help is what we call parental timing, which should last for about six weeks. It involves waking the child up to ease themselves, and over time the child gets used to that timing. If all this fails, there is something called a bed alarm, once the child wears it and wants to ease themselves and the urine touches it, the alarm rings or vibrates and wakes the child up. When all these fail, the doctor can prescribe drugs to control the bladder. But the pediatrician has to be sure because that is the last option. Also, you could encourage a reward system for your child.\n\nFor adults, most of the time you already know that it is an organic problem, so you find the root of the problem and solve it. For instance, if it is diabetes, when you treat it with medications, the blood sugar will come down and frequent urination will reduce. Most of the time in adults, you know the cause and you treat it and bedwetting will go. Some adults are bedwetting even without organic factors, they have had it going on with them for such a long time, right from childhood till adult, they\u2019ll need to see a nephrologist to evaluate them; they may also need to see a psychologist that will evaluate them properly if it is inorganic.\n\nIn adults, bedwetting can be particularly embarrassing. The person cannot just stay back in the house and wallow in shame without seeking medical help. It could just be a situation where the muscle of the bladder is unstable. Some medications may just be enough to solve the problem.\n\nAre there different treatments for bedwetting in children and adults?\n\nMost of the time for children, the issue is not organic, it tends to be more of an inorganic treatment you give to them; you offer a non-medical treatment to them. But for adults, the case is often organic; so you give them medical treatment.\n\nPeople say bedwetting has some spiritual connection. How true is this?\n\nI do not agree with them. From our point of view, there is nothing spiritual about it. It is something that has a root cause and can be traced. If it is not organic or medical in nature, then it is psychology and in such cases, it just needs to be addressed.\n\nAlso, genetic causes based on parental history as well cannot be debunked or overlooked, but the only thing is that most times parents may not divulge that they also had the issue when they were younger. You cannot blame the parents, because of the shame they faced when they were children, so they don\u2019t want the child to experience it; so they may become more aggressive for the child to stop it early enough.\n\nPeople say when you cross over fire it may stop bedwetting. How true is this?\n\nIt is not true, there is no relationship between fire and bedwetting, and all those things are conjectures and superstitious beliefs that have no scientific basis. If the right thing is done, and the right approach is taken, the child will eventually stop bedwetting.",

At a time the region is bitter over delay in constituting aboard for the NDDC some youths could come out to shower praises. This is wrong.

But for now, these youths that came up with the statement under the name Niger Delta Progressives Movement, NDPM, should bury their heads in shame. \u201c, he said.\n\nHe said he had called for the sack of the Minister over the delay in inaugurating aboard for the commission and the deplorable state of the East-West road, adding that he had not changed his mind.\n\nAlhaji Saidu said the Niger Delta is very dear to him because he had been actively involved in driving matters of development in the region, adding that he moved a motion for the north to support the creation of the NDDC at a gathering of prominent northerners at the Arewa House when he was national youth President of Arewa Youth Forum.\n\nContinuing, he said as an aide to the late Harold Dappa Biriye, a Frontline leader of the Niger Delta, he accompanied the late sage to almost all meetings on matters of development of the region.\n\n\u201cAnd at meetings in the north Chief Biriye will ask me to speak first on matters of the region on many occasions before he would wrap up. So you know and see my passion for the region\u201d, he said.\n\nAlhaji Saidu further called for the implementation of recommendations of the Niger Delta Environmental Survey and several other recommendations on Niger Delta, stressing that sweeping them under the carpet was not a good one for any serious government.\n\n\u201cIt is high time federal government visited recommendations on redressing challenges in the Niger Delta. There are several of them. There are the recommendations of the Niger Delta Environmental Survey and many others. They should give them attention so the area can enjoy development \u201c, he said.\n\nOn the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Akpabio, he said he was calling again for his sack because of his failure to keep his promise to inaugurate aboard for the NDDC before August this year.\n\n\u201cWe heard the Minister when he visited stakeholders in Warri, Delta state that he was going to ensure aboard was in place before the end of July.

          "text": "By Prince Okafor\n\nEnergy Management and Automation firm, Schneider Electric has harped on the need for oil and gas companies across the country, to deepen local content in their operations.\n\nThe company made this disclosure at the just concluded Practical National Content organized by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board, NCDMB, in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.\n\nAccording to the General Manager, Sub-Saharan Africa, Process Automation, Schneider Electric, Ajibola Akindele, \u201cThe outbreak of Covid-19 last year led to lockdowns in various countries and restrictions on international travels.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic presented an opportunity for companies to domicile skills and capabilities in Nigeria within Nigerians. Noting that, during the pandemic, there were restrictions in travel as well as repatriations, hence most expatriates could not come to Africa.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic afforded Schneider Electric the opportunity to upskill local engineers. The Nigeria office of the company recorded some of the highest training man-hours during the period of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt was a great opportunity to train our teams and provide exposure to some of the most complex projects. It was important that we localized resources.\n\n\u201cAnd for the part of our business that covers oil and gas, we are domesticating key skills in Nigeria to support the whole of Africa. We are establishing two Centres of Excellence \u2013 one for our Digital solutions and the other for our LNG solutions.\u201d\n\nHe also urged companies to have a long-term focus in their recruitment as this will ensure that the aging workforce have the time to transfer knowledge to the younger professionals.\n\nHe also advocated for formal mentorship programs so that experienced professionals could mentor the younger ones. This is to ensure knowledge transfer.\n\nAkindele also called for collaboration between the oil and gas industry, the government, and the academia to deepen Research and Development in Nigeria.\n\nNoting that currently, R&D in Nigeria is a bit disjointed, he called for collaboration between the industry, government, and the academia. He stressed that the academia needs to conduct researches that is relevant to industry and government should drive policies that will promote R&D.\n\n\u201cWe cannot overemphasize the role that R&D plays. If you looked at the developed countries in the world (the U.S, Germany, China, Japan), they are responsible for 64 percent global R&D spend. And it is intentional. About 2.5 to 4 percent of their GDP goes into R&D. And if you looked at less developed countries, it is in the region of 0.2 \u2013 0.9 percent of GDP.\n\n\u201cWhen a country invests in R&D, that country is able to innovate, leap-frogging other countries, which makes the country richer. It is directly linked to the growth of your GDP. Makes absolute sense! If you don\u2019t invest in R&D, you will continue to be a consumer, unfortunately,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged organizations to support investments in R&D by investing in basic research, funding University endowments and professorial chairs, creating centers of excellence and supporting the commercialization of patents.",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFormer governor of old Kaduna State, Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar, has said that Super Tucano aircraft won\u2019t end the insecurity bedevilling the nation, insisting that this could be achieved only with ground forces.\n\nUmar also said that the $460 million spent on the procurement of 12 Super Tucanos is enough to recruit, train and pay the emoluments of about 200,000 soldiers for one year.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nUmar, in this exclusive interview with Sunday Sun, wondered what difference the change of Service Chiefs has brought into the fight against insurgency in the country, pointing out that the key in the fight against insecurity is massive increase in security manpower and equipment.\n\n\u201cMore boots on the ground not more fixed wing aircraft like Super Tucano.\n\n\u201cAll the forests of the Northwest and some parts of North-central must be combed and dominated by ground forces and surveilled by helicopter gunships. Wild bombings with the use of aircraft amount to wild goose chase. Fixed wing aircraft are not ideal weapons of choice in the fight against banditry and kidnappings,\u201d Umar explained.\n\nUmar dwelt on this and other thought-provoking issues. Excerpts:\n\nThe year 2021 is running out and the season of politics is beginning from next year. In the last six years, we have seen the All Progressives Congress (APC) that promised to deliver in all fronts, including insecurity. You are a farmer and we know insecurity has gone all high in the country. How do you feel about insecurity in the country? As a farmer, how are you averting problems in your farm?\n\nOf course, like every citizen, I am very much concerned about the growing insecurity in the country. The primary responsibility of any government is the security of life and property of its citizens. People give up most of their rights to the state with the hope that their security will be guaranteed. It goes without saying that nothing else matters in the absence of security. What benefit do people derive from the best physical infrastructure in the absence of security? I, therefore, urge this government and future administrations to pay greater attention to the issue of security. Nigeria is currently facing existential challenge due to growing and rapidly metastasizing insecurity. To the second part of your question. I took the painful decision to shut down operations on my Ostrich farm. You will be surprised to know that I have disposed of all my ostriches due to insecurity and high cost of feed. I have actually not been to the farm in the past three years. That is what I mean by asserting that no economic activity is possible without security. I am currently fully retired.\n\nKaduna which you once governed has been very hostile security-wise, with bandits packing students from time to time. Since all these things are happening and your state, Kebbi is relatively peaceful, have you moved away? And how are you coping?\n\nUnfortunately, Kaduna is not the only state facing this problem. It may be one of the most affected. It is, however, the state of my residence, like many retired military officers and civil servants. I have no intention of relocating. In fact, the greatest problem I face is how to travel to Kebbi through Zamfara State.\n\nPeople are taken aback that Kaduna that is home to several military formations is held by the jugular by bandits and other criminal elements. What is your view about this?\n\nWell, these military formations are not tasked with internal security mission. For example, Command and Staff College, NDA, Depot NA and Air Force Training Command are all training institutions. One Mechanised Division has operational responsibility beyond Kaduna State. Kaduna, like all other states, has the problem of anaemic shortage of security manpower.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s policy of not paying ransom to bandits: how do you view it? Is it the right way to go?\n\nIt is not difficult to see El-Rufai\u2019s rationale. There is a direct nexus between the astronomical rise in banditry and kidnappings with ransom payments. But the alternative to ransom payments is the use of force to prevent or rescue victims. Unfortunately, such force is absent. Relatives of victims are left to bear the burden. I really sympathise with governors who have not the wherewithal to marshal such force. Perhaps, this makes a strong case for state police.\n\nHow do you rate the APC on its promises of tackling insecurity, corruption and the economy?\n\nWell, the answer is within your competence as a senior journalist. Luckily, I am only a retired military officer and retired farmer. I have also since joined the late Chief Bola Ige\u2019s sit-down-look party. An honest answer to this question is likely to attract to my person, ad hominem reactions. I beg to pass on this.\n\nWould you say the APC deceived Nigerians with empty promises just to acquire power by all means in 2015?\n\nThis appears to be a leading question. I have already indicated my response earlier. If you are not satisfied, you may direct the question to a PDP member.\n\nThere was fear sometime ago due to happenings in the country that the military may stage a come back. Having been in the military and rose to the top, how do you see this feeling in some quarters?\n\nMilitary rule has always been regarded as an aberration even when people welcomed it in the past. As Winston Churchill aptly opined, \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government except all the others.\u201d Election continues to be the best form of choosing leaders. Regimes\u2019 abysmal failure is the most efficacious catalyst for mobilising the electorate to vote them out. We must continue to tread the path of democracy instead of undemocratic ways like coups. We must, however, fortify our democracy and make military regimes less attractive by insisting on regular free and fair elections. We must ensure the presence of checks and balances by the different arms of government. Democratic dividends are the fruits of any functional democracy. Africa as a whole must tackle the problem of sit-tight leadership. It is an illiberal form of democracy, worse than military regimes.\n\nNigerians demanded for the removal of Service Chiefs. But when it eventually happened, they were appointed ambassadors. How do you see the move by the presidency?\n\nWell, that shows that the Presidency was satisfied with their performance rewarding them with those appointments. I honestly do not believe mere change of Service Chiefs is the elixir in combating our current security challenges even though it was the right decision for the president to submit to public demand and pressure to effect those changes. You may wish to ask, what difference has that change made? The key is massive increase in security manpower and equipment. More boots on the ground not more fixed wing aircraft like the Super Tucano. All the forests of the Northwest and some parts of North-central must be combed and dominated by ground forces and surveilled by helicopter gunships. Wild bombings with the use of aircraft amount to wild goose chase. Fixed wing aircraft are not ideal weapons of choice in the fight against banditry and kidnappings.\n\nElsewhere, the military is for external aggression, but here, they are battling Boko Haram and bandits and for over a decade, our military who have excelled in various peacekeeping missions abroad, have not defeated Boko Haram. What is happening to our military?\n\nWhat is happening is that our military is overstretched. It is engaged in both military and police duties. Yet, it suffers from shortage of manpower and equipment. It is too thinly spread nationwide. If this trend persists, our security forces will become demoralised and ineffective. Adequate troops strength is key to successful mission performance. It also provides for troops rotation. A situation where manpower shortage necessitates lengthy tour of duty, particularly in a hot war, may also lead to fear and low morale amongst troops. Our troops are doing their best and they need to be commended and encouraged. We need to improve their capacity.\n\nMilitary hardware like the Super Tucano and the conditions given by the United States Government: how will they help to tackle insecurity?\n\nI am not aware that the United States Government gave those conditions. They would not sell those planes if there was any possibility of their misuse, particularly in human rights abuse. As I mentioned earlier, fixed wing aircraft like the Super Tucano have great limitations in the kind of warfare we are prosecuting against bandits and kidnappers. The reports of successful operations against bandits are clearly exaggerated. For emphasis, more ground troops are key. The $460 million spent on the procurement of 12 Super Tucanos is enough to recruit, train and pay the emoluments of about 200,000 soldiers for one year. Enough troops strength and time to flush out bandits from their firm bases in the Northwest forests are what is needed.\n\nFarmers-herders crisis: Southern governors banned open grazing and the North is supporting ranches. What is the best way to stop the farmers-herders clashes? Do you support open grazing or ranches?\n\nYou know the herders-farmers conflict is an age-old problem. It has always been a struggle for the control of diminishing land resource. It is being exacerbated by the astronomical rise in population and expansion of crop farming. There is also the problem of desertification in the North leading to shrinkage of arable land. These elements and the primordial method of livestock farming which has the herder roaming in search of pasture and water intensifies the conflict. Even in the era of abundant vacant land, seasonal conflicts occurred. Very few governments paid attention or even attempted to address this very serious problem. Now that the conflicts are getting out of hand, there are attempts to address the problem albeit in an uncoordinated fashion. Truth is, we need protein and crops. We must, therefore, try to create a sustainable method of producing both. The governors are constitutionally empowered to handle this. They must act. You should, however, note that one of the problems that led to the recent worsening relations between herders and farmers is growing incidence of banditry and kidnappings in which rogue Fulanis as distinct from herdsmen, are largely implicated. The fact that herders and some of these criminals share ethnic identity, being Fulanis, makes the herder culpable in a case of mistaken identity. It is true that the herder is often guilty of trespass, but is hardly involved in banditry and kidnappings. Actually, many herders are also victims of these crimes perpetrated by their kinsmen. We must realise and be aware of this distinction, otherwise all Fulanis are in danger of negative profiling and indiscriminate reprisal attacks.\n\nWhat is the way out of secessionist agitations in the country?\n\nSomeone correctly observed that with all the imperfections and weaknesses of our federation, it provides a security umbrella to all the federating units. In the event of Nigeria\u2019s balkanization, almost all the independent units will face the challenge of heterogeneity or diversity. Nigeria is also endowed with natural resources such as vast land area, minerals and large population. All the federating units stand to benefit from these endowments. But since man does not live by bread alone, there are those intangible needs which must be satisfied for him to want to freely belong in the union. Things like equity, justice and fairness are some of the necessary conditions. They are the pillars, the centripetal forces on which a virile, prosperous and united nation exist. Most rational citizens will protest or even demand to exit from an inequitable union no matter the abundant material benefits they stand to gain. It is in this context we should view secessionist agitations. This must have informed the United Nations\u2019 decision to provide for people\u2019s rights to peacefully demand for self determination. President Buhari\u2019s decision to consider the request of Ndigbo elders to release Nnamdi Kanu is a welcome development. I hope he grants their request. Looking at the pattern of this government\u2019s appointments, particularly in the senior positions of our security agencies, the Igbo are fully justified to complain about being excluded or marginalised. Most Igbo leaders who express satisfaction with the status quo must be doing so out of personal consideration. I, however, recognize the right of any person who disagrees and believes that the case of Nnamdi Kanu should go through judicial process. But sometimes, political compromise and settlement are much more beneficial and preferred means of settling such political disputes. Nigeria has an enviable history of such political settlements which helped immensely in our national reconciliation and political social stability. For example, after our 30 months civil war, July 1967-January 1970, which led to the loss of over two million people, the General Yakubu Gowon government decided to pardon the Biafran secessionist leaders in an effort towards national reconciliation. Although Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu was declared wanted, President Shehu Shagari pardoned him in 1982. He returned from exile and contested election under the president\u2019s party, the defunct National Party of Nigeria (NPN). In the spirit of political compromise and fairness, I appeal to Mr President to grant state pardon to Senator Joshua Dariye and former Governor Reverend Jolly Nyame. I honestly believe that considering their offences, the anti-corruption bar has been set too high for the duo. Judged by the same standard, most serving and retired governors would be in jail.\n\nGoing by happenings in the country, any hope for Nigeria?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nOf course. Countries which faced greater challenges in the past had overcome and taken their pride of place amongst some of the most developed or developing countries. After the World War 1 (WW1), the Allies sought to cripple Germany. The Versailles Treaty of 1919 took away all German colonies and some of its most valued land possessions in Europe like the rich Alsace Lorraine. It was made to pay war reparations which resulted in the crippling of its economy and massive pauperisation of its people. Twenty years later, in 1939, Nazi Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, embarked on a most destructive war, WW11 of 1939-1945 aimed at reversing the Versailles Treaty and expanding its frontiers in Europe. Of course, it lost the war and was left in ruins. Today, Germany boasts of the strongest economy in Europe. Coming closer home, nobody gave Rwanda a chance after its early 1990s civil war in which a genocide that claimed the lives of over 800,000 civilians in less than three months. Today, Rwanda has the fastest growing economy in Africa with an annual GDP growth of over eight per cent. It enjoys socio-political stability. Nigerians are a well determined and industrious people.

          "text": "Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodimma, is 63 years old today. As part of events to mark this birthday, he presented a book, entitled \u201cReflections on the Igbo Question\u201d in Owerri yesterday.\n\nIn an interview with ONUOHA UKEH, Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief; IHEANACHO NWOSU, Editor, Daily Sun and FRED ITUA, Correspondent, the Imo State governor told a story of his life.\n\nHe talked about his growing up, family life, politics, life as governor and philosophy in life, among others.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHow do you feel marking 63rd birthday, especially knowing that you are getting older?\n\nI feel very good. I am not afraid that I am getting older. Sometimes, you don\u2019t die because you\u2019re getting old. Our destiny is in God\u2019s hand. However, I must say that when expectations are not met, it makes one feel bad.\n\nThe first thing is to thank God for life. No man is an island. When we were born, others were born too. Many of them were not lucky to attain the age I\u2019ve reached. Many of them are still around, but don\u2019t have the kind of opportunities that have come my way. I attribute everything to the glory of God. I feel strong and healthy. That special grace of God helps me always. It makes me happy.\n\nCould you tell us about some childhood memories that left a mark in you?\n\nI recall as a child, we used to see these research officers, who would come to our village to find out the kind of casava we were planting. They\u2019ll check and tell us the type we can eat and others we shouldn\u2019t, even the ones that were poisonous. That is to tell you the kind of society we had then.\n\nI remember sanitary inspectors who would move from house to house to check our toilets. It is really unfortunate that we have been progressing backwards politically. Since 1999, I can\u2019t remember any brand new road. Roads we\u2019ve today were built by previous governments, yet, we can\u2019t maintain them. Well, one new road I see in South East is the 2nd Niger bridge.\n\nAs I growing child, I knew about the Defence Corporation in Kaduna. The institute was licensed the same time with that of India and Malaysia. Today, that of India is talking of managing atomic energy and construction of missiles. We now go there to buy guns and other security equipment. The only thing our Defence Corporation can do now is to transform to a place furniture are made.\n\nThings are on the decline. It is painful that despite our endowment, we are not progressing. Foreign countries only come here to look for raw materials. M.I Okpara established a palm factory. This gave a value chain. But crude oil which is over 60 years in Nigeria, is still being taken abroad as raw material, whereas in crude oil, you can get other petrochemical things. God gave us this natural resource and it appears we don\u2019t know what to do with it. South Korea doesn\u2019t have one barrel of crude oil, yet, it has 22 refineries.\n\nAt 63, you\u2019ve seen the good, the bad and the ugly. What are those things you enjoyed as a child that are missing now in the country?\n\nMy father lived in Port Harcourt. As children, we would leave Port Harcourt around 5pm on Friday to my brother\u2019s place in Lagos to spend the weekend. We will travel in the night without fear. We had social lives. There was nothing like unknown gunmen. Nobody was being kidnapped. Even armed robbery started like a small thing immediately after the civil war. We thought it was a joke.\n\nThose days, you would graduate and get three different letters of employment from different companies. You\u2019ll begin to consult, to know which one to settle for. These things are missing now. Those days in Lagos, you\u2019ll go to a bus stop and see staff buses conveying workers to the office. In the evening, it was the same thing. Those things have disappeared.\n\nToday, where are those industries? So many things have gone wrong. We had a sense of security and job opportunities. There was respect and value for human life. In 1978-79, if there was an an accident where two persons died, the whole country will mourn. Today, every hour, you see on television, 20 persons dead here, 25 there and 10, in another place. Nobody is interested or affected. People are getting used to very uncommon things.\n\nWe need to sit down and think about these things. If we don\u2019t plan for tomorrow, it will forget about us. Just on Tuesday, I met with President Muhammadu Buhari to apply for additional security so that our people can come home for Christmas. Three years ago, the governor in Imo state didn\u2019t do that. Everyday, things get worse in Nigeria. These things don\u2019t encourage sane minds.\n\nCan you recall when this descent started?\n\nIn 1983, a journalist asked Umaru Dikko why there was poverty in Nigeria and he gave him a sarcastic response. He said he had not seen anybody eating from the dustbin. Since the Second Republic, things started going down, like a child\u2019s play. The public sector management was okay. Politicians then would get contracts and take only 10 per cent. From 1999, when the military handed over power, some leaders were no longer interested in inflating government contracts. They will go to government treasury and take out the money. Nothing has been able to serve as a deterrent. The kind of discipline that should be inculcated into the managers of our economy and leaders is absent. Chinue Achebe wrote that Things Fall Apart and the centre cannot hold.\n\nWhat would say life has taught you?\n\nLife has taught me a lot. In today\u2019s world, if you don\u2019t solve your problem, no one will solve it for you. If you don\u2019t initiate a process, no one will do that for you. I\u2019ve gathered so much experience to the extent that I\u2019m more interested in what will be the end result of every action I take. I\u2019m in a position now to separate my demands from my desires. I\u2019m guided every time by these two factors. I\u2019m also interested in knowing my needs. If only we can go for what we need, there will be some sanity in the country. It is unfortunate that even when some people get what they need, they still keep acquiring things they won\u2019t need. If you can\u2019t manage your greed, it means you\u2019re unfair to humanity.\n\nExperience is very important in everything. People should contribute their experiences to the central platform. I was in the Senate for eight years. During budget consideration, agencies will come with request of 21 computers year in, year out. The only thing that was different was the date. They were copying and pasting. Ministry of Power, for instance, will keep submitting request for 500 transformers every year. Nobody ever cared to ask how many were installed in communities.\n\nWhen I came to Imo State and saw how they were managing payment transaction, it was surprising. I came into a state without credible payroll register. I decided to automate everything. Each step I took, they tried to bring me down. I insisted that I must have the automation completed. I insisted that every staff of Imo State must submit his BVN. They\u2019re still blackmailing me that I don\u2019t pay salaries. I\u2019ve asked them to show me one genuine staff not getting his salary and I\u2019ll bet my money. If you\u2019re not receiving now as a pensioner, it means you were illegally getting multiple pay. It means you\u2019re owing the government because you earned money illegally. Corruption in Nigeria is thick. There is no way you can fight corruption in Nigeria without working on attitudinal change. We must get the buy-in of the people. It appears that many people have been compromised. They don\u2019t want anything to move.\n\nFor the number of years I\u2019ve spent on earth, I\u2019ve garnered so many experiences that shape what I do. I came from the private sector. I\u2019m in the public sector now. The public and private sector administrators need to work together in order for us to move forward.\n\nWhen you look at your life, will you attribute your successes to luck or hard work?\n\nIt is not even luck or hard work. The Canon Principle is faith-based. Everything about me is attributed to God. That\u2019s my faith. If you call it luck, to say that out of about 200 million people, I\u2019ve been lucky, well, well, well. I believe in providence. I ask and the only person I ask is God. Most times, God uses people. Sometimes, people want to help you pass through the gate. If it is not ordained by God, I can\u2019t pass that gate. That\u2019s why I\u2019m friendly with everybody. That\u2019s why I hardly have issues with anybody. Whoever calls himself my enemy, that\u2019s the person\u2019s business. Whenever I stand, I feel fulfilled. I\u2019m not on a wheelchair. I can still exercise for minutes every morning. I\u2019ve good health. I eat what I want. Some people don\u2019t have the kind of health that I have. It is all about God\u2019s grace. If it is not about hard work, I am nor working better or harder than those who push trucks on the street? They\u2019ve more energy and engage in hard work.\n\nFrom your story, it could be assumed that you started learning the political ropes from childhood. Kindly tell us the true story.\n\nI learnt a lot from my father. We was a councillor. My father was an ordinary councillor. His followership was huge. He was nicknamed \u2018chairman of uncommon man\u2019. He was very popular. It was from my father that I learnt not to eat alone. Even in my house, I don\u2019t eat alone. My mother had a large kitchen that was open to everybody. My father did his politics well. He was in Igbo Union. He was a prime minister and died as a traditional ruler. He taught me frankness. Anything I can\u2019t tell you, I won\u2019t gossip about it behind you.\n\nYour book is Reflections on Igbo Question. What message are you trying to pass with the book?\n\nSome times it is good to situate things. People forget easily. If you check, those materials aren\u2019t new. These were my outings during my time in the Senate for eight years. There is none as a governor. Some were done when I attended Igbo congresses abroad or one programme or another in the church.\n\nThese days, some people claim to be more Igbo than others, but contributed nothing in the past. I believe that the Igbo are special and talented breed. I have checked the history of great men in the country. Igbo men were leading. I\u2019ll liken the qualities of an Igbo man to that of the Jews. I\u2019ll like to compare it with the Manhattan project, when Israel never hoped they will become a nation. They didn\u2019t go to any war to get their independence. They sat down and entered into a negotiation. Compromises were made and three years after, the State of Israel was created.\n\nSince Ojukwu tried with his military experience and his father\u2019s money to confront government and was not successful, we shouldn\u2019t think that route. We may not know that what happened before led to a lot of envy for our people. Our neighbours feel highly threatened because of our capacity. But before we are relegated to the background, we can adopt two strategies.\n\nPower can be likened to a lion or a wolf. Those are the only two ways through which you can get power. Like a lion, if you\u2019re sure of your strength, you can pounce and get power. If you\u2019re not sure, you\u2019ve to behave like a wolf. The wolf will befriend you and get what it wants. We can create another system of addressing the inequalities or marginalisation. We tend to always think of war. We can\u2019t even afford it. We need to study our environment and know those we are competing with. If we do that, we will know the right steps to take. Are there those benefiting from our marginalisation? If a particular vehicle can\u2019t take you to your destination, you don\u2019t sit down and wait for it. The most auspicious thing to do, is to get into the next available vehicle and move since the intention is to get to your destination.\n\nI think that the book is another humble way of letting our people know where I\u2019ve always stood. Not because I\u2019m a governor now; this has been my position. Consistently, I have maintained my stance. When we organised a send- off party for Ambassador George Obiozor in Lagos in 1999, though I didn\u2019t have a written speech, I spoke off the cuff. My contribution was about fiscal federalism. I argued in favour of making states semi-autonomous. If a responsible leadership implements all the laws we have in this country, the issue of marginalisation won\u2019t come up.\n\nSome people have talked about denying Igbo major appointment. What\u2019s your take?\n\nWe should look at ourselves well. Sometimes, our inability to be strategic is responsible for the marginalisation. Let me ask some hypothetical questions. As a president, if, for instance the Igbo carry guns and are threatening to secede, would you be comfortable? If there is a vacancy to appoint a Chief of Army Staff, will you, in your good conscience, give the position to an Igbo man? I am just raising posers, but think about that.\n\nIf I\u2019m the president, I\u2019ll be reluctant. I\u2019m the governor of Imo State and I took an oath to protect the people. If somebody starts killing people, do you expect me not to talk or to fold my arms? Sometimes we do things that are actually against us. They\u2019ll think it is in the interest of the Igbo, but certainly not.\n\nI don\u2019t know who determines the interest of the Igbo. In all the meetings, I\u2019ve not heard where the Igbo decided to throw away what they have in anticipation for something they don\u2019t have. The Igbo agenda should be carefully crafted. We should have a summit, where Igbo leaders from different areas of life, will come together and develop a roadmap on how to create an economy. If we use economy as a banner, everybody will join.\n\nIs it safe to say that Igbo are their own enemies?\n\nNo, it is not safe to say that. You remember when Ojo Madueke said those calling for Igbo presidency were idiotic. It took the grace of God for him to get out of it. We need to work. Igbo interest must be collectively designed and defined. It will help us implement.\n\nIn Nigeria before now, we Igbo were the first. We used to take the lead and others would follow. We established the Stock Exchange and many other things. We were the best. We have Zinox, Innoson and others. With a small push, they\u2019ll go far. Our people should be more diplomatic and realistic.\n\nThere are claims that governors are not defending the aspirations of the South East. People believe that there is no confidence in the leadership. What do you think?\n\nI don\u2019t want to blame the people or say that it is wrong. I don\u2019t want to also criticise a governor because I\u2019m one. But our governors should find courage to be tactical. I told you that I was with the president. I told him I needed a dam in Imo State that can give me 10 megawatts. He approved it immediately. If it works, the entire Owerri township will not need to remain with the national grid. We will have a constant power supply. Even if you want Biafra, do it in such a way that your brothers and sisters will be alive to benefit from it, when it materialises. If it is our decision, brains will be put together on how it can be realised.\n\nWe talk about unknown gunmen in South East. I\u2019m the person who came up with the phrase of unknown gunmen. I realised that those caught weren\u2019t Igbo, whereas, people were saying that IPOB and ESN were behind the killings. They were giving us bad names. We needed to find out what was going on. Was it sabotage? Was it because the South East decided to move to the national party to make us strong? Who were behind those killings?\n\nIt was when we worked with DSS that we realised that many of them came from the Niger Delta region. Some were into illegal bunkering business and others worked for politicians to create a false impression. I had to cry out to the president on what I saw. People are killed in villages, but does it make sense that those being killed still turn around to resist an attempt by the Army to intervene? It was just propaganda. When you sit where I\u2019m now, you do what is noble, you don\u2019t fall for sentiments. Sometimes, you\u2019re guided by findings from professionals. You weigh the options and take a decision.\n\nSomeone attacked police headquarters, released prisoners and then someone will oppose us bringing in the Army. That\u2019s nonsense. Those against the Army coming should tell us where these criminals released from prison are. Sometimes, if you listen to people, you\u2019ll derail. Four years will be over and you\u2019ll become a governor who didn\u2019t do anything. You need to be a leader who does the right thing even if people will not see it initially. It is better to hate me when I am doing the right thing than to be blamed for life after leaving office. It is not blackmail. If you follow social media, I won\u2019t do anything. They fabricate things a lot.\n\nBefore you came to office, you knelt down and asked God for help. It is left for you and your conscience. In governance, there are two things. One is ensuring that your people benefit from your policies and the second one is managing public perception. The right thing to do is to ensure that these people are satisfied. Then adopt a strategic communication. You may say Hope didn\u2019t perform, but when you come to Imo, you see good roads. You\u2019ll see all the things I\u2019ve done. Gradually, those funding the propaganda will get tired. I won\u2019t be there forever. That\u2019s the idea.\n\nDuring the Anambra governorship election, there was a new political lexicon, \u2018Anambra is not Imo.\u2019 This was said to denigrate Imo people because of the manner you came to power. How do you feel when you hear such statements? Can you tell us the story of how you became governor?\n\nThere is a proverb in my place. As kids, whenever our parents sent us to the bush to fetch firewood and one of us brought the best and biggest, others who couldn\u2019t, will conclude that you entered the wrong bush. The case in Anambra is pathetic. If you remember, when I was made chairman of the campaign council, I deployed my contacts and goodwill.\n\nWhen I got to Anambra, I created a structure. Out of 30 House of Assembly members, 12 joined APC. These people campaigned and won elections before. Was it the Supreme Court that put them there? No. In the House of Representatives, I convinced eight out of 11 members to join APC. They were members of APGA and the PDP. We got 130 excos from various wards of APGA to join us. We got a serving senator to join us. We were able to talk to the deputy governor and he joined us. If there was a free and fair election, how can we not win? People should think twice.\n\nI don\u2019t want to join issues with anybody. Let anybody come out and say that these people who defected worked against us. I don\u2019t want to join issues with anybody. Let the institutions do their job.\n\nYou can\u2019t liken my case to the Anambra case. I didn\u2019t go to court after the elections to say I was rigged out. I only told the court that INEC conducted elections. We deployed our agents in 388 units. Even in my area of popularity, where I come from, 388 polling units\u2019 results were excluded. Our party agents came back with the results stamped by INEC. We saw clearly that we won the elections. We approached INEC and it didn\u2019t deny the results. It didn\u2019t give us any convincing explanation why the results were not included. We went to the tribunal. INEC came and confirmed the serial numbers on the results. They were the same with what they had. We issued a subpoena to the police. Every polling unit result is distributed to the police. That of police tallied with our own. INEC didn\u2019t deny it. It was only the PDP lawyers that said it was not from INEC. They can\u2019t speak for INEC. They said they were fake and we asked for the original, which they couldn\u2019t tender.\n\nThe lower court admitted the evidence, but it was ignored during judgement. We went to Appeal Court. They used their contacts to get their way. But one of the Justices wrote a minority judgement. He said INEC erred to have excluded our results. It was not a case of just that we overtook the man who claimed to have come first, but we had the spread required by law. But the announcement by INEC came from only five local governments. The PDP man didn\u2019t meet the spread. The votes he used in \u201cwinning\u201d the election came from one local government. I have refrained myself from talking about this issue, but blackmail won\u2019t stop. They\u2019re looking for a distraction.\n\nI like to be underrated. Many of my colleagues in politics don\u2019t know me. I\u2019m one of the most blackmailed politician in Nigeria. That\u2019s the kind of politics we play where we come from. I\u2019m concerned about legality and legitimacy. I can\u2019t remember any guber election from anywhere in the South that didn\u2019t get to the Supreme Court. The man saying that Anambra isn\u2019t Imo, did he not get to the Supreme Court in his own case? Getting to the Supreme Court is part of the electoral process. When you win, your opponents will take you to court. So, if the Supreme Court has confirmed us, is it now an offence?\n\nLet those whose elections were confirmed by the Supreme Court tell us why they accepted the judgement. We were here when a governor in Rivers State was declared by the Supreme Court. The man didn\u2019t even participate in the election. He ruled for eight years. Nobody made issue out of it. The people saying these things today are confused and not truthful to themselves. I think that God must take glory for giving the judiciary the wisdom to give us justice.\n\nAre there things you\u2019ve done that you regret as a person and if given another chance, you do them another way?\n\nI\u2019ve no regrets coming to be a governor. In the Senate, I had a different kind of challenge. I had to think through to get a bill to work. Coming to Imo State, I didn\u2019t imagine that I\u2019ll meet the kind of mess I inherited. The things we thought were on ground were missing. We have limited resources. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t accommodate any distractions. If I come back as a governor, I\u2019ll do the same things I have done so far. No regrets.\n\nAs a handsome man, how do you cope with women?\n\nI\u2019ve told you about my faith in God. As a Catholic, womanising isn\u2019t part of our creed. I lost my first marriage many years ago. I had to wait to pass through the Catholic process before I could remarry. During the period of waiting, if you are seen living recklessly, they\u2019ll not grant the request. All my five big children, I trained them as a single parent. I did school runs in Lagos. I was able to manage that. Today, those five kids are doing well. I trained them all alone.\n\nEnjoyment is a relative thing. You know with the kind of charisma that I have, people will conclude easily that because I always wear white, I like women. Those close to me can attest to my struggles and good way of life.\n\nYou said you don\u2019t keep enemies, but your relationship with Rochas Okorocha isn\u2019t pleasant. The way it is going, Okorocha may feel you\u2019re his enemy. Why has it been difficult to resolve issues with Okorocha?\n\nThat\u2019s not true. The day I was sworn in as governor, Okorocha was there. A few days after, he made a private visit to me and asked me to disband the commission of enquiry set up by Emeka Ihedioha. I asked him if there was a problem. I told him that the people wanted the job done and that we should let it stand. He said as a party man, I should disband it. He came back and sent people to call me.\n\nI\u2019m the man on ground. So much injustice was done to our people. You saw the jubilation that greeted the return of land to people. That\u2019s what he considers as an issue. The white paper came out and we saw everything. He wanted to forcefully gain entry into one of the property and he was stopped by security agents. There is a difference between private and public interest. Okorocha is not my enemy. But my relationship with him should not make me sin against God. I don\u2019t need anything. The only land I have was bought from a family. Government didn\u2019t give it to me. By January, I would have spent two years in office. I\u2019ve not allocated land any how. Those I\u2019ve given are for government institutions. I\u2019m not fighting Okorocha. You know I\u2019m older than him. As his elder brother, he should consult from time to time, according to the traditions of our people.\n\nYou said after one year in office, people will be shocked at what you\u2019ve done. Can you still say that now?\n\nDuring my one year anniversary in office, Catholic Archbishop of Owerri, Obinna, said something. The bishop disagreed with all former governors, but publicly, Bishop Obinna said I had shocked him. Many speakers said the same thing. It is not in my place to assess myself. I would have done better if not for this insecurity. I have awarded two major contracts worth over N60 billion to dualise roads from Orlu and from Okigwe, just like the one in Epe, Lagos. No governor since the creation of Imo State has been able to allocate such funds for road construction.\n\nMbakwe brought the water scheme. After about 27 years, I\u2019ve revived it. We are trying to do reticulation. It is servicing Owerri now. We want to replace the pipes with new ones. Ada Palms is running, doing over 100 tonnes of oil everyday. Efforts in agriculture, infrastructure, and others are going on. We are building 305 health centres. They\u2019ll start working next year. I\u2019ve paid all the counterpart funding of UBEC. We are working on new 105 model primary schools in 305 wards. When people have access to healthcare, good roads and schools, then there is prosperity.\n\nDid you ever think you could be governor before now?\n\nAll the roads in my community and electrification were done by me as an individual. I was just a businessman. At a time, I discovered that the best way to help people was to have a responsive government. I supported Governor Achike Udenwa. What an individual can do in 200 years, a government can do it in two minutes. I started sponsoring people. Sometimes, if you\u2019re not there, there is a limit to what you can go. In 2003, I tried and it didn\u2019t work under AD. I\u2019m 2007, I qualified for a run off and I was not successful and went back to Lagos. In 2011, I contested for Senate and won. I defeated a sitting senator and a former governor. My people know me. Those who are surprised that I convinced people in Anambra to join APC don\u2019t know me. If that election was done properly, we would have won. Sometimes, it is not about the product, but the ability of the salesman to sell.\n\nDo you think the Electoral Amendment Bill is what the president should sign?\n\nThe role of the Parliament is to make laws. We don\u2019t make laws just for today. Based on my experience as a parliamentarian, we have to make laws for today and tomorrow. The Electoral Act should guide our elections. If candidates must be sponsored by the political parties, it means the current amendment will be in conflict with the provisions of the constitution. Going to tell political parties that they must settle for direct primaries without minding if the parties can fund it is wrong. Many political parties can only afford indirect primaries.\n\nThe Electoral Amendment Bill is a good job, but restricting political parties to just one mode of primaries is undemocratic. They should open the political space for a broader inclusion. Not all parties can afford direct primaries. Political parties should be left to decide the mode of primaries they will take. I\u2019ve restrained myself from commenting on this matter. I think that the rights of political parties to field candidates in an election shouldn\u2019t be conditionally determined by a law. This action maybe null and void. People should not come and abuse positions given to them by the people.\n\nWhat informed your fashion style of white and what are the things that make you happy and sad?\n\nWhite represents purity. It means I want to be pure. When I see this white, I remember that I need to work toward being pure.\n\nWhat makes me happy is accomplishments. When I see expectations being met, I\u2019m happy. Disappointments make me sad. I believe that Nigeria can do better.\n\nWhat are your thoughts about how other countries treat Nigeria?\n\nImagine me in London and we were placed on a red list by the British Government. Why the rush? We are not treated fairly. I was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Aviation one time. I did an investigation then on the disparity between airfares to Nigeria and other countries. I discovered that a first class ticket from Heathrow to Accra was cheaper than an economy ticket from Nigeria to the same place. Whereas, from Accra to Heathrow is six hours, 40 minutes, from Nigeria, it\u2019s about six hours or less depending on where you are taking off from. It was during my time that the managing director of British Airways appeared before our Senate panel. I threatened to shutdown their operations in Nigeria. I wrote a letter to British Airways, which they sent to the British Prime Minister. The British PM sent it to President Goodluck Jonathan. Jonathan invited me and I explained to him why this was important. He obliged me.\n\nThe managing director of British Airways landed in Abuja with two senior lawyers from Lagos. I asked him why the charges were higher. I asked why there was no Nigerian pilot or a co-pipot in his fleet. There was also no building of British Airways in over 70 years. No investment. No major employment. It was just extortion. That week, they reversed it. I removed the 25 per cent aviation tax they charged. Two, three months later, they reversed again to the old order.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nForeigners did everything to kill Arik Air.

          "text": "A former Interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, has said that ex-Vice-President Atiku Abubakar rejected the party's National Leader, Bola Tinubu, as his running mate in the 2007 presidential election.\n\nBy 2007, Atiku had fallen out with former President Olusegun Obasanjo over his plan to succeed his principal along with his opposition to Obasanjo's third term agenda.\n\nThe disagreement later forced Atiku to defect to the Action Congress (AC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTinubu and some others had been instrumental to the formation of the AC.\n\nAtiku lost the Presidential election to the PDP's Umaru Musa Yar'Adua after coming third while Muhammadu Buhari of the All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP) came second.\n\nIn his autobiography, My Participations, Akande, who was the National Chairman of the AC, said though the party settled for Ben Obi as Atiku's running mate, it could have been Tinubu.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, we formed a party, the AC, with Abubakar Atiku. We agreed that Atiku should be our presidential candidate and we had the understanding that he would run with Bola Tinubu. I was the chairman of the AC. One day, after we had nominated Atiku as our presidential candidate, one young man came and gave me a form from INEC (Independent National Electoral Commission). I told him I could not sign a blank form and that I, as the Chairman, must know the name that would be filled in it.\n\n\u201cThe young man, Bashir Yusuf Ibrahim, must have been the organising right-hand man of Atiku. He was an active person from Kano. The following morning, he came again with Lawan Kaita. Kaita begged me and said it was Ben Obi whom Atiku had chosen as his running mate behind our back. So, I signed the form because I believed as the candidate, Atiku had the right to choose his running mate. If I refused to sign, that would create a crisis.\n\n\u201cWe believed that Atiku should have chosen his running mate from the AD (Alliance for Democracy) even if he was no longer favourably disposed to Tinubu. With Atiku, the party would be strong in the North, but because of the preponderance of PDP in the South-East and the South-South, it would face more resistance in that area. Obasanjo was stepping down from the Presidency. Therefore, the Yoruba, even the few that benefitted from his arrogant rule, would no longer be obliged to vote for the PDP.\n\n\u201cSegun Osoba, Niyi Adebayo and Lam Adesina had earlier met Atiku and we proposed to him our choice of Tinubu, and he promised to come back to us. He gave us a date. On that date, we all assembled. Atiku came with Audu Ogbe, Tom Ikimi and Usman Bugaje.\n\n\u201cWe proposed that Tinubu should be the running mate, though Tinubu was not at the meeting. Atiku would not give us an immediate answer. He said he wanted to have more consultations.\n\n\u201cIkimi, Ogbe and others were all very strong against Tinubu, because they said it would mean a Muslim-Muslim ticket. We deadlocked over that. Atiku never said anything. We left the meeting. What prompted us was that anytime we said we needed money, Atiku would say \u2018Bola, please help us\u2019. Bola was the only one spending the money among us. The rest of us were poor. Tinubu also put all his energy and resources into the formation of the AC and we felt he deserved a spot on the ticket. We discussed with Bola on this and he said we should discuss with Atiku. It was after we were deadlocked that they brought me the blank form. So, Atiku ran with Obi and failed. Only Lagos State from South West voted for Atiku in all the states of Nigeria.\u201d",

We agreed that Atiku should be our presidential candidate and we had the understanding that he would run with Bola Tinubu. I was the chairman of the AC.

          "text": "The Hausa Association of Nigeria, also known as Kungiyar Hausawan Nijeriya or KUNHAN) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign from office because of the obvious failures of his administration.\n\nThe association in an open letter to Buhari on Sunday, which was obtained by SaharaReporters, said the Buhari regime spared Fulani terrorists and bandits, but went after agitators such as Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra and Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, Yoruba Nation agitator.\n\nThe association noted that the \u201cHausas regret supporting and voting\" for Buhari massively.\n\n\"Therefore, we call for your resignation with immediate effect. As we suspect the worst ahead under your administration,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nThe letter further reads, \u201cAs an Hausa Association (KUNHAN), we deem it necessary to write you this open letter to portray the true picture of Hausas' mood during this trying time. We thought we have chosen a messiah based on your saying, 'We are going to secure this country, we are going to manage it properly, we will continue to improve the security situation, economic and fighting corruption', but it turned out to be fictitious.\n\n\u201cTurji and Co. are high profile deadly Fulani terrorists but still nowhere to be found because they are just a threat to Hausas rather than your sovereignty while Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho could be found even beyond our territory.\n\n\u201cThe most basic obligation you were bestowed with as a President when you were sworn in, is to protect lives and property but under your watch, hundreds if not thousands of atrocities and genocide were carried out on Hausas. Our people are always incarcerated, killed while our mothers and daughters are being raped mercilessly without tangible measures to tackle the menace. On so many occasions, you have bragged to crush the bandits and proclaimed to take necessary action but all in vain.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are now matured to dictate to our collective population because of your empty threat. It has been happening for over five years and these terrorists are known as we have been seeing them on so many occasions with Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, even with serving Governors yet they could not be apprehended and dealt with. The answer is one, because they are not a threat to this administration while those that seem to be a threat are already in jail; Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cThat's why a whole Minister of Information named them just an ordinary criminal but called Nnamdi Kanu a terrorist. We Hausas have regretted supporting and voting you massively, \u201cTherefore, we call for your resignation with immediate effect, as we suspect the worst ahead under your administration.\u201d",

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why Nigerians must vote in 2023",
          "text": "\u201cI can\u2019t remember when last I voted in Nigeria,\u201d a female private school principal in Lagos told BusinessDay on condition of anonymity.\n\nShe however, said that she has her Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) for any \u201ceventuality.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always tried to get those national documents that may be needed in critical situations, but not to use them for anything like voting,\u201d she said.\n\nOn her reason for not participating in real voting, despite possessing the PVC, she said: \u201cNigeria is like a hell. Sometimes you wonder if those in power are human beings. They don\u2019t have human heart. So, what is the point going to waste my time voting for a government that neither benefit me nor my family? The saddest part of it all is that whether it is PDP or APC, it is the same story.\u201d\n\nThe woman, who is in her early 50s, also said: \u201cThere is no evidence of government in my entire life as you can see. I went to school on my sweat; I have been working and paying the bills of my children education. I source for the water we use; pay high cost of electric bills, high rent, there are no roads, name it; it is all about sad story anywhere one turns. My husband lost his job owing to bad economy and the company could no longer cope; yet we hear about billions of naira, dollars and other currencies being stolen by those in government. So, tell me, what is the essence of voting?\u201d\n\nThe experience narrated above is widespread in Nigeria. Many citizens have grown weary of voting and that accounts for the increasing voter apathy the country is experiencing since the 2015 elections.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Don\u2019t sit on the fence\n\nNigeria in the last 6 years\n\nBefore the return to civilian rule in 1999, most Nigerians were helplessly enduring many years of servitude by the junta, which as expected, never cared if the \u2018ordinary civilians\u2019, as they derogatorily refer to the masses, are dead or alive.\n\nSadly, 22 years after the return of civil rule, the masses are seeing worse treatments than in all the military regimes of the 70s and 80s put together.\n\nThe talk of the \u2018good all days\u2019 sound fable, while the masses have lost faith in the leadership of the country, especially in the last six years.\n\nIf there are truly dividends of democracy, the masses have not tasted such in the last six years; rather they have been fed with stone in the place of bread and blood in place of water.\n\nThe facts are there.\n\nWith two recessions in the last six years, the economy has been in a very bad shape, with the government helpless at any time it happens.\n\nIn the last six years, foreign exchange has been more volatile, with Naira losing stability of N160 to the American dollar speedily to about N560 today. In the last six years, which captures the present administration, inflation has risen unimaginably, food security is fable, insecurity has taken deadlier dimensions, corruption, which the government swore to fight, is fighting back and winning more converts, poverty is preeminent as the country infamously ranks as the world capital of poverty today.\n\nFor those who encourage the youths to vote in the 2023 elections, there are many reasons not to step out as Nigerian unemployment ranks among the highest in the world at 33.3 percent.\n\nAt 33.3 percent unemployment rate, it means 23.2 million of the about 70 million people who should be working in Nigeria are out of work and these are mainly youths who the government said it is after their future, amid promises of job creation, which are never fulfilled.\n\nOf course, the country is witnessing a very high inflation rate, the worst in six years. Though the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) claimed that Nigeria\u2019s annual inflation rate fell for the seventh straight month to 15.99 percent in October of 2021, from 16.63 percent in September, food prices are still rising daily at a very high percentage in the last six years.\n\nRecently, the NBS reported that the annual food inflation rate rose for the 24th consecutive month to 20.75 percent in October from 20.71 per cent in September this year, owing to further increases in the prices of basic food items.\n\nThere is no need to ask for what the plights of the masses are now. They are getting poorer daily, one square meal difficult, quality education and healthcare far out of their reach.\n\nWith a bag of rice going from less than N10,000 six years ago, to about N30,000 now, fuel pump price being increase more than four times in the last six years, garri now out of the reach of the poor, and building materials untouchable, many are hungry and homeless, and millions have fallen into that category in the last six years.\n\nAccording to the UN Development Programme (UNDP) new study on the war and its effect on livelihoods published this year, over 350,000 have been killed in the 12-years violence in the North East of Nigeria, with more deaths in the last six years.\n\nAccording to data obtained from the Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), a project of the Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Africa programme, in the first six weeks of 2021, over 1, 525 persons were killed across the country.\n\nThe 1,525 deaths are about half of the 3,188 lives lost between January and December 2019, according to a report by Global Rights.\n\nYet, farmers-herders clashes took a deadlier turn in the last six years, with the class resulting in 10 deaths more than Boko Haram killings in the past six years.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria is the third country most impacted by terrorism, according to Global Terrorism Index 2020 after Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nSadly again, Nigeria increased to 149 out of 180 countries in 2020 from 146 in Corruption Perceptions Index of Transparency International, while observers worry that the country will top the rank before the present administration, which claims to fight corruption, finishes its tenure in 2023.\n\nThe worst still is the rise in religious intolerance and fanaticism as seen in Boko Haram Islamic sect, tribalism, nepotism, among other forms of injustice that have divided the country. As many rightly observed, \u201cNigerian has been more divided in the last six years than in its 61 years as a nation.\u201d\n\nWith all these constraints, electioneering in the country is hugely impacted as many see no reason to vote, when their votes will not count, when their region is neglected, when campaign promises will never be fulfilled and when the masses have overtime given up on the leadership and the country\u2019s brand of democracy.\n\nVoting the only way out\n\nDonatus Okonkwo, founder, Tetrazzini Group of Companies, recently admonished Nigerians that \u201cGetting involved is the only solution. You don\u2019t have to like politics, you have to get involved.\u201d\n\nIn its recent newsletter, EnoughisEnough (EiE), a non-governmental organisation in Nigeria, advised: \u201cDo Not Just Register, Vote!\u201d\n\nIt further said: \u201cCompleting the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) process is a demonstration of your intention to participate in the elections! However, when intent is not converted to action on Election Day, the results can be far reaching.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how genuine the reasons for not taking part in electoral processes in the country, Nigerians have been urged to change the habit in 2023 in order to have a change of narrative.\n\n\u201cOften times, we hear people say \u2018let them go do their voting; I will not get involved\u2019. But these are the same people that would turn around to complain about a government they did not take part in putting into power. Bad governance can be checked at the polling unit. It is not enough to register and collect a Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) as many Nigerians do today, but they really do not vote on Election Day. 2023 is approaching and presents another opportunity for Nigerians to vote in those they believe have the capacity to turn things around positively,\u201d Tony Uwa, a political scientist, said.\n\nUwa noted that looking at the situation of things in the last few years, it is difficult to convince anybody to go vote, but that \u201cthings can get worse if people decide not to vote. Nigeria is in a critical situation that it must have to be rescued by every well-meaning citizen. This can only be done by our votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny sincere person who lives in Nigeria in the last six years will tell you that things have gone bad terribly. The killings along going on a daily basis; abduction and all manner of criminality is mindboggling. In my entire life, I have never seen a thing like that. So, there are too many reasons for every Nigerian to go vote in 2023. Nigerians must take back their country. And there is the need for us to have a breath of fresh air; we are really suffocating,\u201d he further said.\n\nElectioneering is a major component of democracy. It is the main yardstick used to determine the level upon which countries in the international system have been able to embrace social equality.\n\nThis process presents the citizens of a given country the opportunity to decide who represents them in governance at the local, state and national levels. It is therefore unarguable that elections are very fundamental to the stability of democracy, as it regulates representation of popular will.\n\nHowever, despite the progress Nigeria has made in its democratic quest in the last two decades, the general lack of interest among Nigerians in exercising their civic responsibility and voting to elect who leads them is widely acknowledged.\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common for people to feel nonchalant and lack concern about the electoral process; the situation has however, become a source of concern to the stakeholders and electoral umpire.\n\nA vivid picture of the situation could be seen in the 2019 general elections where incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari was re-elected with the backing of 15.2 million voters, his main rival Atiku Abubakar also scored 11.3 million votes.\n\nPresident Buhari had 56% of the total votes cast, in a country with a population of close to 200 million people, including more than 84 million registered voters.\n\nHowever, observers say that the 15.2 million votes hardly qualify as a huge mandate. The 35% voter turnout was down from 44% in the 2015 general elections and down from the 54% turnout in 2011.\n\nThe situation is the same for other forms of election in Nigeria; this can be seen in the July 24 council poll in Lagos State, in which the total number of votes cast was 678,324 out of over 6 million registered voters in the state.\n\nPundits say that the lack of inclusion, especially the youth population in the electoral process, and the feeling that whoever wins, nothing would change, the corrupt and fraudulent manner elections are conducted in Nigeria has played a significant role in exacerbating apathy among Nigerians.\n\nThey advised that there was the need for stakeholders to carry out more political education among the electorate, especially during major elections.\n\n\u201cNigerians must come to vote, because when you don\u2019t vote, don\u2019t complain when someone who is not fit is elected. But I think the situation is becoming a crisis, it has gone from bad to worse now when you look at the figures of people who voted in recent elections.\n\n\u201cLook at the recent Anambra election, even the by-election held recently. What is the number of people voting? It is a problem that needs a holistic appraisal, we know Nigerians are not happy with governance; also increased violence during elections played a part in scaring people away,\u201d political analyst Kunle Okunade said.\n\nOkunade added that the government must restore voters\u2019 confidence by delivering on good governance and educating the voters and creating awareness before major elections.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the issues and the authorities must deal with it and carry out education of the electorate, increase information before election\u201d, political analyst Kunle Okunade added.\n\nSimilarly, lamenting the poor voter turnout in last July 24 Lagos council elections, the chairman of the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC), Justice Ayotunde Phillips (rtd) acknowledge that the commission needs to intensify her voter education strategy to improve on the number of voters\u2019 turnout in subsequent elections.\n\n\u201cThe commission would have her voter education strategy to better improve on those numbers in subsequent elections,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nEddy Olafeso, a former national vice chairman South-west of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) warned that though successive governments had failed Nigeria over the years, there was the need for Nigerians to change their attitude because it is only their vote they can make meaningful change they sort.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI know over the years the government has failed Nigerians, but we can\u2019t keep folding our hands, feeling less concerned during elections, would it help anybody? It is through your vote that you can make that change, it is your voice.\u201d\n\nBuhari should sign the amended Electoral Bill\n\nMounting an advocacy on the Electoral Bill, EiE Nigeria urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give his assent without further delay.\n\nIn its newsletter released Friday night, titled: \u2018Why is the President silent?\u2019 EiE quoted its \u2018Yemi Adamolekun, executive director, as saying: \u201cIt is clear that until Nigerians understand their rights and responsibilities and use that knowledge to hold government accountable, our society will continue to be unjust.\u201d\n\nIt noted that the Electoral Bill had been transmitted to the President by the National Assembly since November 19, 2021, with no response whatsoever from Mr. President. It wondered \u201cWhy the cryptic silence?\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cTo further complicate matters, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, allegedly stated that the reputation of President Muhammadu Buhari would not diminish whether he passes the electoral amendment bill or not. What a joke!\u201d\n\nThe group also wondered if\n\n\u201cOur leaders are up to another mischief.\u201d\n\nIt further said: \u201cChapter 4, Section 58(1) of the Nigerian 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides the National Assembly with the power to transmit a bill passed by the House to the President to sign within 30 days of receipt.\n\n\u201cAgain, Chapter 4, Section 58(5) of the Constitution states that if the President refuses to sign, and the bill is again passed by each House, by a two-thirds majority, the bill shall become law, and assent of the President shall not be required.\n\nDecember 19th is only 9 days away!\n\nYour reputation is already at stake, Mr. President! Break the silence!\u201d",

          "title": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November",
          "text": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November\n\nThe ability of Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their various obligations is under more risk as gross monthly distribution by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to the three tiers of government dropped by N68billion in November.\n\nFAAC allocation to the three tiers of government and public agencies amounted to N671.9bn ($1.62bn) in November (from October revenue), a decrease of 9.2 percent from the previous payout.\n\nData by Coronation Merchant Bank shows that the 9.2 percent decline in November FAAC was due to the decrease in the revenue from companies\u2019 income tax (CIT), petroleum profit tax (PPT), value-added tax (VAT), oil and gas royalties. Only excise duty recorded an increase over the previous month.\n\nThis means various state governments already impacted by low internal revenue may find it difficult to pay government workers or meet electorate promises without enough remittance from NNPC which form a large chunk of revenues shared at the FAAC meetings in Abuja.\n\nBreak down of the report by Coronation revealed that the FGN received a total of N284.3billion, state governments received N209.8billion, including N21.5billion representing the 13 percent derivation for the few oil-producing states and LGCs received N156.3billion.\n\nThe continuous decline in Nigeria\u2019s FAAC allocation to the three tiers of government is also due to the subsidy payment, according to market analysts.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has been deducting from its remittance to FAAC, a threat to the ability of many Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their financial obligations.\n\n\u201cSince June \u201921, the corporation has deducted a total of N939bn from its FAAC remittance. It disclosed that it would deduct its October \u201821 value shortfall of N199bn from its November \u201821 proceeds,\u201d Chinwe Egwim, Chief Economist, Coronation, said.\n\nThe continuous payment of subsidy on petroleum products is likely to reduce the amount the government allocates to states and local governments as well as increase public debt, according to the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG).\n\nThe private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group said if the federal government continues to pay the subsidy on refined petroleum products; it could push Nigeria into a debt extension by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cIncessant payment of subsidy on refined petroleum products would narrow FAAC allocations and widen the country\u2019s budget deficit. If this continues, the action could push Nigeria into a Debt Overhang\u201d by the end of 2021,\u201d the Lagos-based non-profit organization said.\n\nWhile Nigeria continues to channel huge resources to funding petrol subsidies, the country largely depends on borrowing to finance its capital and recurrent expenditure annually.\n\nNigeria\u2019s widening budget deficit has pushed the country\u2019s debt profile to jump 81 percent in four years to N35.465 trillion as of June 2021 from N19.636 trillion in 2017.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Debt Management Office (DMO) says Nigeria\u2019s total public debt amounted to N35.47 trillion (about 86.5 million dollars).\n\nWhile crude oil prices rose by nearly 45 percent from January\u2019s price of $54.77 per barrel to $84.02 in November, Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy costs have risen 10 times faster at 488 percent, wiping out the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe Federal Government spent an estimated N149.28 billion subsidizing petrol in August, an increase of 488 percent compared with the N25.37 billion spent in January.\n\n\u201cThe federal government reluctant to regulate the downstream sector or even try to reduce the price of petrol has reflected market reality that has continued to be on the deficit on government revenue because the amount they need to subsidize PMS has continued to rise,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, Associate Investment Research in United Capital, said.\n\nAccording to Abdulazeez Kuranga, economist, Cordros Securities, the issue of subsidy payment was not in the budget when it was presented by the minister of finance, which means NNPC will continue to deduct the subsidy, and it will affect what NNPC will be remitting to FAAC, which in turn will limit what will be remitted to the government.\n\nWhile Nigeria has, for years, depended on borrowing to fund its revenue shortage, the World Bank says implementation of tax reforms, rationalization of generous concessions, expenditure can help the cash-strapped country raise as much as N10 trillion.\n\n\u201cIn the next three years, such measures can raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to about 7 percent and bring in as much as N10 trillion,\u201d the Washington-based lender said.",
          "summary": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in NovemberThe ability of Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their various obligations is under more risk as gross monthly distribution by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to the three tiers of government dropped by N68billion in November.\nThe continuous decline in Nigeria\u2019s FAAC allocation to the three tiers of government is also due to the subsidy payment, according to market analysts.\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has been deducting from its remittance to FAAC, a threat to the ability of many Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their financial obligations.\n\u201cSince June \u201921, the corporation has deducted a total of N939bn from its FAAC remittance.\n\u201cIncessant payment of subsidy on refined petroleum products would narrow FAAC allocations and widen the country\u2019s budget deficit.",

          "title": "Airline row: Air Peace accuses UAE of spreading falsehood in letter to Nigerian govt",
          "text": "West Africa\u2019s leading airline, Air Peace has described the claim by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that it operates from another airport other than Sharjah International Airport as falsehood calculated to damage on its brand.\n\nThe airline which said this in a letter it issued to the Ministry of Aviation and addressed to Senator Hadi Sirika, the minister on Saturday, said it takes very serious exception to that letter.\n\nAir Peace said it believes that the Minister and the Chairman of the Board of UAE\u2019s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) may have been misinformed of the true position of the issues in discourse as no one in such an exalted position and office would deliberately push out such untrue statement.\n\nAir Peace said that contrary to what the GCAA claims in its letter, it never ceased operating from Sharjah International Airport since it started in July 2019. It said it only stopped when every other airline was forced to stop normal scheduled flight operations as a result of the Covid-19 lockdowns that permitted only evacuation flights.\n\n\u201cWe did several evacuation flights out of Sharjah. So, we never left Sharjah Airport nor did we at any time \u201cshifted\u201d and operated out of DXB (Dubai Airport). The letter deliberately painted us as unserious while at the same time, suggesting that we look for other airports in the country to operate from,\u201d Air Peace said.\n\n\u201cAfter the restriction of scheduled flight operations between UAE and Nigeria was lifted towards the last week in November 2021, we approached the Sharjah Airport and GCAA with a request to allow us to operate a charter into the UAE on December 01, 2021.\n\n\u201cTo our surprise and, despite the lifting of the ban on flight operations between both countries, they refused. They said they would not allow charter but scheduled flight operations.\n\n\u201cHowever, we then, in obedience to their demand, announced resumption of scheduled operations beginning from that date and we opened our sales to the public.\u201d\n\nAccording to Air Peace, three days to departure, the GCAA was yet to approve flights and came back 48hours to deny them of slots to operate flights. They were later told that Air Peace would only be accepted if only it brought a small aircraft.\n\n\u201cOn our request to continue with the scheduled operations after this present flight, we were turned down using lack of slot as excuse. Meanwhile, Emirates had started operating three flights daily into Nigeria while Air Peace was totally turned down!\u201d\n\nAir Peace said the one slot was only given to them after the NCAA had made threats to withdraw Emirates Airlines ministerial approval.\n\n\u201cThen, at your threat of going to stop them if Air Peace was not allowed a meagre three flights weekly, THEY QUICKLY DID THE UNTHINKABLE. THEY GAVE US ONE FLIGHT ONLY PER WEEK! They also added that it must be operated only on Thursdays at a time that they chose themselves,\u201d the airline said.\n\nWhile reiterating that at no time did it stop operating in Sharjah and moved to Dubai airport, Air Peace has demanded a retraction an unreserved apology from the GCAA.\n\n\u201cTo this end therefore and, for the fact that this falsehood contained in the said letter has painted us in bad light and gone viral, even though the UAE Minister of Economy may have been misinformed by his aides, we, still, and humbly demand a retraction of the offending accusation of \u201cstopping, shifting and returning\u201d and an unreserved apology tendered to Air Peace,\u201d it added.\n\nRecall that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Minister of Economy, Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, had in a letter to Sirika dated December 10, defended its decision to reduce flight schedule of Air Peace from three to one, saying it is unreasonable for the country to retain the airline\u2019s slots at the Sharjah International Airport.\n\nAl Marri, who doubles as the chairman of the General Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, had in the letter described as unjust, the decision of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw its approval for Emirates Airline winter schedule, cutting down the carrier\u2019s daily passenger flights from 21 to just once a week.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cThe General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Aviation (FMA) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and has the honour to refer to the letter Ref. No. NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329 dated 9th December 2021, whereby the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) notified the Country Manager, Emirates Airline (EK) in Nigeria regarding the withdrawal of the ministerial approval granted to that airline with respect to their Winter Schedule. The NCAA further advised EK that this withdrawal becomes effective on Sunday 12th December 2021 at 2300Z and hence, EK \u201cis granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, as it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire. (Air Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah airport. It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.) In this regard, we wish to kindly advise you. that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous effort on their Side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) Minister of Economy, Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, has justified the decision of his country to reduce flight schedule of Nigeria\u2019s leading airline, Air Peace from three to one, saying it is unreasonable for the country to retain Air Peace slots at the Sharjah International Airport.\n\nAl Marri, who doubles as the chairman of the General Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, in a letter penned on December 10, 2021, and addressed to the Nigerian Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, described as unjust, the decision of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw its approval for Emirates Airline winter schedule, cutting down the carrier\u2019s daily passenger flights from 21 to just once a week.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cThe General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Aviation (FMA) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and has the honour to refer to the letter Ref. No. NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329 dated 9th December 2021, whereby the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) notified the Country Manager, Emirates Airline (EK) in Nigeria regarding the withdrawal of the ministerial approval granted to that airline with respect to their Winter Schedule. The NCAA further advised EK that this withdrawal becomes effective on Sunday 12th December 2021 at 2300Z and hence, EK \u201cis granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, as it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire. (Air Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah airport. It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.) In this regard, we wish to kindly advise you. that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous effort on their Side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations. As we are both aware, the relations between our two brotherly countries are vintage in nature, one hallmark being the recent visit of the President of Nigeria to the UAE, which certainly mirrored the status of these positive relations.\n\n\u201cFinally, we suggest that Air Peace should consider flying their two other flights to any UAE airport at which there are available slots. As expected, the GCAA will support Air Peace in this activity, where required.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, your kind support is anticipated so that the NCAA reviews their decision and restores the approval of the Emirates Airline Winter Schedule, as filed. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that this is a purely operational matter between Air Peace and Sharjah Airport and in any case it should have absolutely no implications for Emirates Airline.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Government had on Thursday, in a letter through the NCAA Director-General, Musa Nuhu, whittled the daily flights of Emirates Airlines to just one per week.\n\nNigeria had about a week ago lifted the ban on Emirates Airline\u2019s flights to Nigeria after suspending the carrier from operating into Nigeria for several months earlier, due to concerns over UAE carrier\u2019s requirements in the management of COVID-19.\n\nNuhu had stated that following the lifting of the ban, the UAE-based airline applied to the Federal Ministry of Aviation for approval of its winter flight schedule, consisting of 21 weekly passenger flight frequencies to Nigeria, noting that Nigeria approved the schedule in the spirit and intent of the Bilateral Air Services Agreement between both countries.\n\nHe, however, expressed dissatisfaction that Air Peace Airlines, the only Nigerian airline that operates passenger flights to Sharjah International Airport in UAE, requested three weekly passenger flight frequencies but was granted only one weekly passenger flight frequency.\n\nThe action of UAE authorities prompted the decision to also whittle down Emirates flight into the country to one per week, a move that was hailed by industry stakeholders.\n\nNuhu explained to aviation correspondents in Lagos on Friday that the government decided to respond to the way UAE treated Air Peace, saying that it is the responsibility of government to protect Nigerian businesses.\n\nBut in reaction to Nigeria government\u2019s decision, Emirates Airlines announced that it is suspending operations to the country till further notice.\n\nEmirates on its website yesterday announced that it would suspend its flights to Nigeria from December 13, 2021 until the two countries reach an amicable resolution on the matter.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWith the recently imposed directive limiting Emirates to operate one flight per week to Nigeria via Abuja, Emirates will be suspending its flights between Nigeria and Dubai from 13 December 2021, until the UAE and Nigerian authorities work on a solution to the ongoing issue.\n\n\u201cThe last flights to operate on 12 December 2021are EK 783/784 to/from Lagos and EK 785/786 to/from Abuja.\n\n\u201cCustomers holding tickets with the final destinations Lagos and Abuja will not be accepted at the point of origin,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe airline also said that affected customers do not need to call Emirates immediately for rebooking, adding that customers can simply hold on to their Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with their travel agent or booking office to make new travel plans and expressed regrets what this may have caused its customers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEmirates is committed to its operations in Nigeria, and we stand ready to reinstate services once restrictions are lifted by the Nigerian authorities, ensuring travellers have more choice and access to trade and tourism opportunities in Dubai, and beyond to our network of over 120 destinations,\u201d the airline added.\n\nCurrently, over 25 foreign airlines operate flights into Nigeria; some daily, from multiple destinations.

          "text": "The Hausa Association of Nigeria (Kungiyar Hausawan Nijeriya or KUNHAN) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign as a result of his administration\u2019s apparent failings.\n\nThe association claimed in an open letter to Buhari on Sunday, obtained by SaharaReporters, that the Buhari administration spared Fulani terrorists and bandits while targeting agitators like Nnamdi Kanu, the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, and Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba Nation agitator.\n\nThe association noted that the \u201cHausas regret supporting and voting\u201d for Buhari massively.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we call for your resignation with immediate effect. As we suspect the worst ahead under your administration,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nThe letter further reads, \u201cAs an Hausa Association (KUNHAN), we deem it necessary to write you this open letter to portray the true picture of Hausas\u2019 mood during this trying time. We thought we have chosen a messiah based on your saying, \u2018We are going to secure this country, we are going to manage it properly, we will continue to improve the security situation, economic and fighting corruption\u2019, but it turned out to be fictitious.\n\n\u201cTurji and Co. are high profile deadly Fulani terrorists but still nowhere to be found because they are just a threat to Hausas rather than your sovereignty while Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho could be found even beyond our territory.\n\n\u201cThe most basic obligation you were bestowed with as a President when you were sworn in, is to protect lives and property but under your watch, hundreds if not thousands of atrocities and genocide were carried out on Hausas. Our people are always incarcerated, killed while our mothers and daughters are being raped mercilessly without tangible measures to tackle the menace. On so many occasions, you have bragged to crush the bandits and proclaimed to take necessary action but all in vain.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are now matured to dictate to our collective population because of your empty threat. It has been happening for over five years and these terrorists are known as we have been seeing them on so many occasions with Sheikh Abubakar Gumi, even with serving Governors yet they could not be apprehended and dealt with. The answer is one, because they are not a threat to this administration while those that seem to be a threat are already in jail; Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why a whole Minister of Information named them just an ordinary criminal but called Nnamdi Kanu a terrorist.

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and Speaker of House of Representatives Mr Femi Gbajabiamila to investigate the N10 billion funds budgeted to the National Assembly said to be missing.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, SERAP Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare asked the leadership of the National Assembly to \u201cpromptly probe and refer to appropriate anti-corruption agencies fresh allegations that N10bn of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated or diverted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe grim allegations that N10,051,283,568.82 of public money is missing are documented in the 2019 audited report by the Auditor-General of the Federation.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Imo Traditional Ruler Regains Freedom After Two Nights In Abductors\u2019 Custody\n\nSERAP\u2019s statement followed a letter dated 11 December 2021 wherein the group wants the ninth Assembly to address the allegations that improve public confidence and trust in the ability of the National Assembly to exercise its constitutional and oversight responsibilities and to adhere to the highest standards of integrity in the management of public funds.\n\nAccording to the group, little can be achieved by the National Assembly in the fight against corruption if the leadership and members do not first confront the specter of alleged corruption and mismanagement within their ranks.\n\nThis is even as the organisation asked Lawan and Gbajabiamila to identify the lawmakers and staff members suspected to be involved and hand them over to appropriate anti-corruption agencies to face prosecution, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and to ensure full recovery of any missing public funds.\n\nSERAP added, \u201cAs part of its legislative and oversight functions, the National Assembly has a key role to play in the fight against corruption in the country. But the National Assembly can only effectively perform its anti-corruption role if it can demonstrate exemplary leadership to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement involving the legislative body.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2019, the House of Representatives paid N2,550,000,000.00 to members as running costs between July and December 2019, but failed to account for the money, contrary to paragraph 1011(i) of the Financial Regulations. There was no evidence to show what the funds were used for, and no documents to back up the spending.\n\n\u201cThe Auditor-General is concerned that the money may have been \u2018diverted.\u2019 He wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly paid N258,000,000 as cash advances to 59 officers between February and December 2019 but has failed to account for the money. The officers were paid the money despite the fact that they have not accounted for the previous cash advances.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly paid N107,912,962.45 as repairs and maintenance allowance for unspecified residential quarters but failed to account for the money. The money spent was also in excess of the cash advances threshold of N200,000.00 as stipulated by the Financial Regulations.\n\n\u201cThese fresh allegations amount to fundamental breaches of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and the country\u2019s international obligations including under the UN Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption.\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that allegations of corruption continue to undermine economic development, violate social justice, and destroy trust in economic, social, and political institutions. Nigerians bear the heavy economic and social costs of corruption. The National Assembly, therefore, has a responsibility to curb it.\n\n\u201cEnsuring the effective investigation of these fresh allegations, and full recovery of any missing public funds would strengthen the country\u2019s accountability framework, and show that the National Assembly can discharge its constitutional responsibility of amplifying the voices of Nigerians, and act in the best interest of the people.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if you would indicate the measures being taken to address the allegations and to implement the proposed recommendations, within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.\n\n\u201cIf we have not heard from you by then as to the steps being taken in this direction, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel the leadership of the National Assembly to implement these recommendations in the public interest, and to promote transparency and accountability in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly collected N1,594,807,097.83 as PAYE, car and housing loans from 17 members between February and December 2019 but failed to show receipt of remittance to relevant revenue authorities. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives also reportedly paid N1,010,598,610.97I from salary account but without any document to show for the payment, contrary to paragraph 601 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly collected N219,645,597.08 as housing loans from 107 senators\u2019 salary arrears between July and December 2019 but failed to remit the money.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly recovered N123,320,916.72 being car loans to senators between July and December 2019, but there was no evidence that the money was remitted to the treasury. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly collected N176,267,255.31 as PAYE from staff salaries but there was no evidence that the money was remitted to the relevant tax authorities, contrary to paragraph 235 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly collected N277,411,116.29 as Value Added Tax (VAT), and Withholding Tax (WHT) but failed to remit the money to the relevant tax authorities. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate reportedly paid N1,718,130,630.24 for the supply of vehicle and other office equipment between February and December 2019 but failed to account for the money, contrary to paragraph 110 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General is concerned that the money may have been diverted.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly paid N657,757,969.05 for the supply of motor vehicles, motorcycles and other office equipment between July and December 2019, but failed to show any document for the payment, contrary to paragraph 1705 of the Financial Regulations. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Senate also reportedly paid N423,370,000.00 for the supply of utility vehicles and production of National Assembly Logo between August and November 2019 but without any documents. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly Service Commission reportedly paid N31,927,760 as cash advances to 59 staff but failed to account for the money. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly Service Commission also reportedly collected N276,749,014.68 as stamp duty from contractors and service providers but failed to remit the money to appropriate tax authorities.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Auditor-General Report for 2018, the Nigerian Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies deducted N577,634,638,20 as taxes but failed to remit the money to the relevant tax authorities. The Auditor-General wants the money recovered and remitted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies also reportedly spent N47,750,000.00 to buy a residential building without due process, and contrary to Section 27 (1) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act and Financial Regulation 301.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the Auditor-General in 2015, 2017 and 2018 reports documented that over N8bn of public money budgeted for the National Assembly is missing, misappropriated or diverted.\u201d",

          "title": "Young Graduates Can Solve Nigeria\u2019s Biggest Problems, Says Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Saturday expressed optimism that young Nigerian graduates can provide solutions to the biggest challenges confronting the nation.\n\nHe made the remark while speaking at the 60th anniversary of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, in Osun State, according to a statement signed by presidential spokesperson, Laolu Akande.\n\nThe Vice President, who was the Special Guest of Honour at the convocation ceremony of the University, stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari as Visitor, and was accompanied by the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola. While the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, delivered the Convocation Lecture at the event presided over by the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Dr. Yahaya Abubakar, as Chancellor of the University.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid To Say It Out,\u2019 Sanwo-Olu Asks Students To Report Bullies\n\nAccording to the VP, while young Nigerians, particularly the OAU graduands, stood on the shoulders of great men and women before them, the onus is on their generation to \u201cdeal with the biggest issues that confront the world, and our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is big and innovative ideas that will solve those problems. You will have to confront the problems of climate change and a world moving away from fossil fuels, and you will usher in the age of renewable energy and green solutions,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\nHe added that this generation of young Nigerians are equipped and could proffer solutions in the areas of education, agriculture, health care and security.\n\n\u201cYes, the challenges are huge, but you are well equipped to resolve them; and the evidence is there\u2026 Since 2016, despite two recessions, young Nigerians have built 6 unicorns; a unicorn is a company that is valued at over a billion dollars,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe VP added, \u201cYou will deal with the issues of feeding, educating, providing healthcare and jobs for the fourth largest population in the world in a few decades. We will need smarter Agric solutions to feed the huge numbers, technology is already helping to crowd-fund Agriculture and develop more prolific seedlings.\n\n\u201cYou will confront the need to vastly improve our public and clinical healthcare. We must build on the work of the Genomic Centre at Ede, and the local vaccine production efforts going on already and make local drugs for hundreds of millions of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn education, while noting that the sector needed several new solutions, including designing methods to teach millions even outside of classrooms, the VP stated that \u201cthere are many young men and women already doing great things using technology to reach children in far flung areas with education.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President added that the use of technology and improvement in nationwide policing would further help the country address its security challenges.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity problems we are experiencing, the rise of terrorism in several parts of this large country and access to modern weaponry by non-state actors tell us that we must be smarter in policing the country, using smart drones and surveillance equipment. The politicization of importation of arms tells us that we must manufacture our own arms.\n\n\u201cAlready Proforce, led by Ade Ogundeyin, is manufacturing APCs and MRAPS in their factory in Ode Remo and exporting. So are Imperium, and the government-owned DICON (Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria) producing different types of munitions. The future is smart weapons benefiting from A.I. and machine learning,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Osinbajo then praised the vision of the University\u2019s founders and management in driving the academic excellence for which the Obafemi Awolowo University is known, an institution, which he said has produced great thinkers and leaders throughout its history.\n\nCopiously quoting the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, for whom the university was renamed, the VP recalled that \u201cChief Awolowo, for many years Chancellor of the University, gave some of the most memorable and consequential lectures on the political economy of Nigeria; and addressed some of its most crucial problems, including the imperative of democracy, national economic development, ideology of governance and national census figures.\u201d\n\nHe also observed that OAU was very much ahead of its time when it named its medical faculty, the Faculty of Health Sciences, and its engineering faculty, the Faculty of Technology.\n\nCommending the achievements of several alumni of the university over the years, Prof. Osinbajo narrated how US-based Prof Oluyinka Olutoye, an alumnus of the faculty of health sciences gained \u201cglobal recognition when he led a team of surgeons, to successfully take a 23-week-old baby out of her mother\u2019s womb, removed a tumour and returned it to the mother\u2019s womb where the injuries from her operation healed and she continued to grow until she was born, the second time at 36 weeks.\u201d\n\nHe also observed that \u201cnot surprisingly, the early leaders in tech and tech-enabled businesses were alumni of OAU\u2019s Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering; Segun Ogunsanya, CEO of Airtel Africa, and Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria. Another Great Ife Alumnus and product of this same department, Prof. Akintayo Akinwande, who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the world\u2019s most respected professors of electrical engineering and computer science.\u201d\n\nMost recently, according to the VP, \u201canother alumnus of the Electronics and Electrical engineering department. Miss Funke Opeke, made global investment news when Equinix, the global conglomerate announced that it was acquiring MainOne, the company she founded, for $320 million.\u201d\n\nContinuing on the feats of OAU Alumni, Prof. Osinbajo recalled that he had \u201cthe pleasure of meeting with Professors Adesuyi Ajayi and Femi Babalola, both OAU alumni, when they undertook ground breaking research and clinical trials into the potential use of Ivermectin as a prophylactic and cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOther notable OAU alumni and lecturers mentioned in various fields of endeavours included Segun Osoba, Sesan Dipeolu, Toye Olorode, Oladipo Fashina, Segun Adewoye, G.G. Darah, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina (President of the African Development Bank), Dr. Okey Oramah (President of Afrexim Bank) and Prof. Toyin Falola, the distinguished historian now of the University of Texas at Austin, USA.\n\nHe also noted OAU\u2019s new generation alumni, including Nairaland\u2019s Seun Osewa; Jobberman\u2019s Olalekan Elude, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Opeyemi Awoyemi, among others.\n\nThe VP added that \u201cit was while still teaching here also that Prof. Wole Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. But less well known is the fact that he was also a lecturer at the University of Ife, Ibadan Campus, in the early 1960s.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President congratulated the graduands, who were doctoral candidates bagging their Doctors of Philosophy degrees. He also congratulated the two honorary doctorate recipients at the Convocation: the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, and well-known business tycoon, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo.\n\nAccording to him, the calibre of honorary graduands at the ceremony was testament to the University\u2019s high standards.\n\nPaying tributes to the faculty of the university, the VP, himself a professor, paused \u201cto celebrate my colleagues in academia, the great scholars, and fine academics who make up the faculties here at the OAU; you are the thought leaders at a historic moment, whose great task is to guide the present and inspire the future.\u201d\n\nHis speech also highlighted the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2025 as including establishing a strong foundation for a diversified economy, investing in critical infrastructure, power and broadband, enabling human capital development and improving governance and strengthening security.\n\nIncidentally, the VP also noted that \u201cone of the crafters of the Plan, Ambassador Yemi Dipeolu, the Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, is also an alumnus of OAU, while his father, Mr. Sesan Dipeolu of blessed memory, was Ife\u2019s first African librarian.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said \u201cthere is much to show and many stories to tell; stories of the institution itself and many of incredible successes of its alumni; stories of the triumphs of human endeavour, the primacy of ideas, the creative force of the introspective mind and the power of vision.\u201d\n\nIn the opinion of the Vice President, \u201cOAU is and continues to be very much a bastion of progressivism and innovation, and not surprisingly you will find the phrase \u201cAluta against all oppression\u201d in the Great Ife anthem. This progressivism is evident in the outlook of staff and students alike.\u201d\n\nPresent at the Convocation were eminent Nigerians, government dignitaries, top officials, traditional rulers, academics, staff and students.\n\nAt the end of the Convocation, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Eyitayo Ogunbodede, conducted the VP and other dignitaries around an arts exhibition to commemorate the event.",

          "text": "As the omicron variant sweeps through South Africa, Dr. Unben Pillay is seeing dozens of sick patients a day. Yet he hasn\u2019t had to send anyone to the hospital.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why he, along with other doctors and medical experts, suspect that the omicron version really is causing milder COVID-19 than delta, even if it seems to be spreading faster. \u201cThey are able to manage the disease at home,\u201d Pillay said of his patients. \u201cMost have recovered within the 10 to 14-day isolation period.\u201d said Pillay. And that includes older patients and those with health problems that can make them more vulnerable to becoming severely ill from a coronavirus infection, he said. In the two weeks since omicron first was reported in Southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar stories. All caution that it will take many more weeks to collect enough data to be sure, their observations and the early evidence offer some clues. According to South Africa\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases: \u2014 Only about 30% of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in recent weeks have been seriously ill, less than half the rate as during the first weeks of previous pandemic waves.\n\n\u2014 Average hospital stays for COVID-19 have been shorter this time \u2013 about 2.8 days compared to eight days. \u2014 Just 3% of patients hospitalized recently with COVID-19 have died, versus about 20% in the country\u2019s earlier outbreaks. \u201cAt the moment, virtually everything points toward it being milder disease,\u201d Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, said, citing the national institute\u2019s figures and other reports. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, and we need to get the final data. Often hospitalizations and deaths happen later, and we are only two weeks into this wave.\u201d In the meantime, scientists around the world are watching case counts and hospitalization rates, while testing to see how well current vaccines and treatments hold up. While delta is still the dominant coronavirus strain worldwide, omicron cases are popping up in dozens of countries, with South Africa the epicenter. Pillay practices in the country\u2019s Gauteng province, where the omicron version has taken hold. With 16 million residents, It\u2019s South Africa\u2019s most populous province and includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the capital, Pretoria. Gauteng saw a 400% rise in new cases in the first week of December, and testing shows omicron is responsible for more than 90% of them, according to health officials. Pillay says his COVID-19 patients during the last delta wave \u201chad trouble breathing and lower oxygen levels. Many needed hospitalization within days,\u201d he said. The patients he\u2019s treating now have milder, flu-like symptoms, such as body aches and a cough, he said. Pillay is a director of an association representing some 5,000 general practitioners across South Africa, and his colleagues have documented similar observations about omicron. Netcare, the largest private healthcare provider, is also reporting less severe cases of COVID-19.",

Forty of them were rescued.\n\nA twister carved a track that could rival the longest on record as the stormfront smashed apart a candle factory, crushed a nursing home and flattened an Amazon distribution center.\n\nIf early reports are confirmed, the twister \u201cwill likely go down perhaps as one of the longest track violent tornadoes in United States history,\u201d said Victor Genzini, a researcher on extreme weather at Northern Illinois University.\n\nThe death toll of 36 across five states includes six people in Illinois, where an Amazon facility was hit; four in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed; and two in Missouri.\n\nThe longest tornado on record, in March 1925, tracked for about 220 miles (355 kilometers) through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. But Genzini said this twister may have touched down for nearly 250 miles (400 kilometers). The storm was all the more remarkable because it came in December, when normally colder weather limits tornadoes, he said.\n\nDebris from destroyed buildings and shredded trees covered the ground in Mayfield, a city of about 10,000 in western Kentucky. Twisted metal sheeting, downed power lines and wrecked vehicles lined the streets. Windows and roofs were blown off the buildings that were still standing.\n\nThe missing at the candle factory included Janine Denise Johnson Williams, a 50-year-old mother of four whose family members kept vigil at the site Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmastime and she works at a place that\u2019s making candles for gifts,\u201d her brother, Darryl Williams, said. \u201cTo give up the gift of life to make a gift. We haven\u2019t heard anything, and I\u2019m not presuming anything. But I\u2019m expecting for the worst.\u201d\n\nHe said Johnson Williams called her husband overnight to report the weather was getting bad, the last time anyone heard from her.\n\nKyanna Parsons-Perez, an employee at the factory, was trapped under 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) of debris for at least two hours until rescuers managed to free her.\n\nIn an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d she said it was \u201cabsolutely the most terrifying\u201d event she had ever experienced. \u201cI did not think I was going to make it at all.\u201d\n\nJust before the tornado struck, the building\u2019s lights flickered. She felt a gust of wind, her ears started popping and then, \u201cBoom. Everything came down on us.\u201d People started screaming, and she heard other workers praying.\n\nKentucky State Trooper Sarah Burgess said rescue crews were using heavy equipment to move rubble at the candle factory. Coroners were called to the scene and bodies were recovered, but she didn\u2019t know how many.\n\nRescue efforts were complicated because Mayfield\u2019s main fire station and emergency services hub were also hit by the tornado, Creason said.\n\nAfter a wall at a nursing home in Mayfield collapsed, Vernon Evans said he rushed to help firefighters pull people out, only to find one resident lying dead in a few inches of water.\n\n\u201cAll I could do is sit there and hold their head up,\u201d he said. \u201cI never experienced nothing like this.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden approved an emergency disaster declaration for Kentucky on Saturday and pledged to support the affected states.\n\n\u201cI promise you, whatever is needed \u2014 whatever is needed \u2014 the federal government is going to find a way to provide it,\u201d Biden said.\n\nSix people were killed in the collapse of the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, with another injured worker airlifted to a hospital, fire Chief James Whiteford said.\n\nInvestigators searched the rubble throughout the day for additional victims and 45 people survived, Whiteford said. Authorities were uncertain Saturday evening whether anyone was still unaccounted because workers were in the midst of a shift change when it was struck by the tornado about 8:30 p.m. Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is a devastating tragedy for our Amazon family and our focus is on supporting our employees and partners,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a written statement.\n\nThe Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which has been trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Alabama, criticized the company for keeping the Illinois site open during a weather emergency.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson\u2019s office said the storms killed at least two people in the state and initial assessments indicate they destroyed or did major damage to hundreds of homes and buildings.\n\nWorkers at a National Weather Service office had to take shelter as a tornado passed near their office in Weldon Spring, Missouri, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of St. Louis.\n\n\u201cThis was an incredible storm that lasted a long time and covered a lot of territory,\u201d said Larry Vannozzi, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office covering the Nashville area.\n\nMeteorologists haven\u2019t determined whether the storm spawned a single tornado or multiple tornadoes, he said.\n\nIn Arkansas, a tornado struck a nursing home in Monette, killing one and trapping 20 people inside as the building collapsed, Craighead County Judge Marvin Day told The Associated Press.\n\nAnother person died when the storm hit a Dollar General store in nearby Leachville, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said.\n\n\u201cProbably the most remarkable thing is that there\u2019s not a greater loss of life,\u201d Hutchinson said after touring the wreckage of the nursing home. \u201cIt is catastrophic. It\u2019s a total destruction.\u201d\n\nFour storm-related deaths were confirmed in northwestern Tennessee, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said.\n\n\u201cThis is about the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said after touring the community of Dresden, which saw its downtown corridor ripped apart. \u201cThe whole town, the whole town.\u201d",

          "text": "Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal has accused the military of making the state \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d to the activities of bandits flushed out from Zamfara State.\n\nNo fewer than 23 travellers were burnt to death last Monday when some bandits opened fire on a bus in the state.\n\nThis is coming as the pastor of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Nariya, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Rev. Dauda Bature has been killed by his abductors after 30 days in captivity.\n\nFollowing the killing of the passengers by gunmen in Sokoto, President Muhammadu Buhari dispatched a delegation comprising heads of security agencies to the state.\n\nThe National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Bichi, Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, and Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo, are part of the delegation.\n\nSpeaking when he received the delegation, Tambuwal blamed the situation on the influx of bandits displaced by clearance exercises carried out by Operation Hadarin Daji in Zamfara State.\n\nThe governor alleged that the resultant effect of the exercises had led to attacks and kidnappings \u201cin broad daylight\u201d in some parts of the state.\n\n\u201cOperation Hadarin Daji, the precursor of the escalation of tension and crisis in Sokoto State was carried out without any blocking force around the neighbouring states, particularly Sokoto State,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, the timing of the operation, whereby, unfortunately, our security agents do not have enough equipment to move and curtail and contain those that would pander towards Sokoto State didn\u2019t help the timing as well. So, the timing and the way the operation was carried out left Sokoto very vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt does appear as if those bandits pursued from Zamfara State have relocated to Sokoto State. This is a very serious call for concern.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for more boots on the ground. I am familiar with the situation at the centre, but I believe that something can be done, and, that should be done urgently and expeditiously because our situation is getting out of hand.\u201d\n\nTambuwal added that the state is also trying its best to curtail security challenges.\n\n\u201cHere in Sokoto State, you can verify this from the heads of security agencies, there is nothing they have asked of us that we have not done. Nothing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of this administration, we have given security personnel in Sokoto State not less than 500 vehicles. We are also doing whatever it takes in terms of funding from our end despite the lean resources that we have as a state.\u201d\n\nIn his response, Monguno, who led the delegation, restated the federal government\u2019s commitment to flushing out banditry and protecting citizens from all forms of criminal activities in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are in Sokoto on a specific mission instructed by President Buhari, to condole you and the very good people of Sokoto State as well as the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, over the unfortunate incidents that have been occurring over the last couple of weeks,\u201d Monguno said.\n\n\u201cMr. President is conveying his profound condolence over the loss of all the citizens who have departed.\n\n\u201cHe also wants us to express his deep sympathy as well as his determination that the perpetrators of this gruesome, wicked activities are apprehended and brought to book.\n\n\u201cHe has charged to make sure that all the relevant agencies do not rest until we can flush out the perpetrators of not just these last two incidents that occurred, but also previous incidents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the pastor of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Nariya, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Rev. Dauda Bature, has been killed by his abductors after 30 days in captivity.\n\nDare-devil bandits have also invaded parts of Sabon Tasha GRA, Oil Village, and Anguwan Bulus areas of Kaduna metropolis, abducting eight residents including a policeman and his family.\n\nBature was abducted from his farm on November 8, 2021.\n\nHis abductors were said to have demanded N5 million ransom.\n\nIt was gathered that after negotiations, his wife went to deliver an undisclosed amount of money to the criminals in the bush.\n\nIt was further learnt that after collecting the money, she too, was kidnapped by her husband\u2019s captors.\n\nThe bandits released her on December 6, 2021, to go and look for more money for her husband\u2019s release.\n\nChairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, confirmed the killing of the clergyman.\n\n\u201cIt was yesterday (Friday) that the information came when our pastors were at a conference and the leaders of the church went to officially tell the wife that her husband is no more so that they don\u2019t continue negotiations with the bandits,\u201d Hayab said.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Sabon Tasha, Oil Village, and Anguwan Bulus, areas of Kaduna metropolis had sleepless nights as bandits visited them with terror on Thursday and the early hours of Saturday, abducting eight people.\n\nThe hoodlums were said to have invaded Sabon Tasha GRA and Anguwan Bulus simultaneously in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nResidents said the bandits who came at about 1 a.m. were repelled by soldiers who responded to distressed calls.\n\nThe hoodlums were said to have burnt a house located at Tanko Kokwain Street after they forced their way to the house only to discover that there was nobody around.\n\nConfirming the GRA attack in a statement on, Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, said the bandits, invaded GRA and Oil Village at about 1 a.m. yesterday.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Kaduna Police Command through Divisional Police Officer Sabon Tasha Division Kaduna acted on a distress call received from a good Samaritan to the fact that some suspected armed bandits numbering about 30 with some in military gears and bearing dangerous weapons, were making ferocious effort to break into a residential area at Sabo GRA in Chikun LGA of the State in an attempt to commit the heinous crime.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it was discovered that the bandits operated simultaneously with one at oil village in the same Sabo location where they kidnapped a woman and her four children to an unknown destination.\u201d\n\nHe said further that investigation into the two incidences had since commenced while efforts were being made to rescue the victims.\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto",
