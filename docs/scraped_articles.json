          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill will be re-introduced into the house, reworked and passed on Wednesday.\n\nGbajabiamila, in his opening address as the National Assembly returned from break on Tuesday, restated the benefits of restricting political parties to direct primary while criticising the parties for lacking comprehensive membership registers.\n\nAccording to him, a strict direct primary option would have forced the parties to have a documented register.\n\nThe Speaker noted that the general elections in 2023 are fast approaching, hence the need for the lawmakers to fast track work on the electoral reforms.\n\nHe also noted that the parliament has the option of either overriding the veto of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), or amending the bill based on the President\u2019s observations.\n\nHe partly said, \u201cUnfortunately, that bill did not receive presidential assent and it is unlikely that it will in its current form. Now, we have to choose between sticking to our guns regarding the provision to mandate direct primary for political parties or reworking that provision to save the rest of the bill.\n\n\u201cI remain convinced that the proposal for direct primary is valuable for building accountability in our political system but we must not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Therefore, the House will reintroduce the amendment tomorrow and we will work quickly to address the mitigating concerns, pass the bill and send it back to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, for assent.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila also decried the errors said to have been discovered in the bill, noting that the version transmitted to the President was different from the one being scrutinised by the public.\n\nThe Speaker said he had, however, set up a technical committee to peruse the legislation which is expected to report back by Thursday.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Opinion: The dilemma of the North",
          "text": ".\n\nBY SOLA EBISENI\n\nIN spite of the undeniable clear identity of the Middle Belt and its incomparable gargantuan geographical space, those who still fantasise the old monolithic North would not budge.\n\nThey keep wallowing in the preservation of the North and would not agree that the empire the British helped them create have long served its useful purpose.\n\nThe empire is in a constant state of flux either from the exigencies of statecraft which ensure its fragmentation in state creation or the unchecked influx of tribes of all nations in common brotherhood bound either by religion or cultural occupation which puts the earth and its fullness at the unpartitioned disposal of all. In that situation, it requires no research into history to acquire citizenship.\n\nThe insistence on One-North is strategic to keep the veil on the diversity of the region and present a semblance of unity of purpose. Truth be told, the way the geographical architecture of Nigeria was cobbled by the British, only two geopolitical zones (South West and South East) could boast of a contiguous territory of one people with traditional mutual intelligibility.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nWe were saints compared to today\u2019s level of corruption \u2014 IBB\n\nThe politics of 2023 have literally torn Nigeria asunder with a cacophony of voices incapable of national consensus. The most veritable of the issues, as they come, is the need to restructure the nation politically for the enviable true federalism on which the nation was erected leading to Independence in 1960. There has been undeniable evidence, before and in the course of Buhari\u2019s administration, of Nigeria national consensus for restructuring. Most of those opposed to it today are only acting out their words in public. We shall return to this in due course.\n\nAt a recent conference in Awka, Anambra State, January 3 to 5, 2022, leaders and representatives of the Southern and Middle Belt Forum unanimously agreed and pushed for power shift to the South in 2023 for inclusiveness and a sense of belonging for the good health of the nation. One of the submissions that caught my attention admirably was the theory of attainment of power espoused by my friend and brother, the National Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson.\n\nAfter a critical analysis of power and its sojourning across the nation, particularly since 1999, Robinson submitted that power could be attained in this country by negotiation, deceit or subterfuge and if need be, by force. All of these strategies are equally applicable in war and reminded me of Carl von Clausewitz\u2019s submission that \u201cpolitics is the continuation of war by other means\u201d.\n\nLooking back years after, it is clear that the strategy of President Buhari\u2019s rise to power at any time in the history of Nigeria has been an intricately interwoven combination of all of these factors. At his first coming in 1983, the impression was deliberately created that he did not know about the coup and that he was only called upon, by virtue of his rank, to lead the government. Those who erroneously claim that Buhari\u2019s current modus operandi in government is borne out of age and health issues only need to open the books and they will find out that Buhari of today is not different from who he was in 1983 when, at 41, his group toppled the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari.\n\nHe was dark goggled like Idiagbon, his deputy and Chief of Staff Supreme Headquarters, who was rightly dubbed the Prime Minister by the ever-sensitive Nigerian press which saw him at the seat of power on a day-to-day basis. Buhari quietly appropriated the Idiagbon efforts and energy which kept him in the psyche of Nigerians as a no-nonsense leader. So when it was time again that Nigerians felt the need for a spartan General, Buhari needed not much introduction to them.\n\nIt needs to be emphasised that force and violence were not spared on the way to democratic power, no thanks to extremist views which equated those perceived to be responsible for electoral malpractices with baboons, monkeys and cockroaches who must be crushed. It was not by accident that 12 corps members lost their lives to reactive mob actions in Bauchi. Of course, it was also an era when any military action against Boko Haram insurgents has been termed an attempt to tamper with the demographic, thus electoral advantage of the North.\n\nPray, what is the difference between Kanu\u2019s allusion to Nigeria being a zoo and a dwelling place of baboons and monkeys? The difference is only found in George Orwell\u2019s own allegory of Animal Farm where the statement that took one to the palace landed the other in prison. It is pathetically amusing (oro buruku t\u2019on t\u2019erin) that Mr. President couldn\u2019t put the alleged offences of Kanu in perspective beyond the fact that \u2018he was safely abroad abusing us\u2019 as a mere verbal altercation between Kanu and the dramatis personae of Buhari\u2019s government.\n\nThe President would not contemplate releasing Nnamdi Kanu particularly now that he has been brought back to defend himself for calling his fatherland a jungle. We insist that if that is the qualification for trial without the amnesty, the terminology was not authored by Kanu who only surfaced in 2015.\n\nNigeria has been so euphemistically pronounced as the abode of baboons and monkeys requiring lions and tigers to neutralise. It is the parable of the jungle where the ongoing trials of Kanu and Igboho are the only treatment for the underprivileged.\n\nOf course, all those failed to yield results until the Jagaban hit a deal with Buhari. Each of them had what the other needed. The 12 million Buhari consistent votes were most attractive to the Lagos tactician who already had the South West, except the ever naughty Ondo. The negotiations and permutations worked so much that elections were even most peaceful and churned out the largest number of voters in the most violent North East.\n\nThe press was undaunted in its resolve to see to the end of Jonathan who was deliberately and most unkindly soiled with the image of cluelessness. Today is no day for comparison.\n\nThe race for 2023 has begun in earnest, with its inherent contradictions and amusements. The APC is still grappling with the legality of the management of its structure which either puts its convention on hold or is bedevilled with such problems that make the gathering at a convention intractable. In such hullabaloo, there is surprisingly and admirably the consensus on which side of the Nigerian North/South divide would produce the next President. It seems settled that the pendulum has swung to the South.\n\nOn the other hand, the PDP which has admirably put its convention behind it, even before the National Assembly\u2019s regimented direct primary, is locked in the prism of the morality of the zoning of its presidential ticket. The moral burden has left all presidential hopefuls in the lurk, unable to announce their aspirations to the nation. The closest to it is the statement credited to the new National Chairman, amiable former Senator Iyorchia that he would resign his position should the presidential candidate of the party emerge from the North.\n\nSuch comment from Ayu who was former Senate president and the co-chairman of the Electoral and Political Committee of the 2014 National Conference, with his counterpart, also former Senate President Ken Nnamani, could mean so many things which nevertheless confirmed ambivalence on the part of the party on zoning the president.\n\nBy the way, I served in that same Committee with both Ayu and Nnamani and still wondering where the likes of Ken are in the quest of Ndigbo for Nigeria\u2019s president. If the position of the ethnic nationality groups mean much in the equation of where the President would be voted, four of them, representing the four geopolitical zones of the South West (Afenifere), South East (Ohaneze Ndigbo), South-South (PANDEF) North West and several parts of North West and North East (Middle Belt Forum) have pitched their tents with the South producing the next president as an interim arrangement which will ensure equity pending restructuring of the country when the location of the President may not matter.\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum and its Northern Elders Forum variant are, not unexpectedly, singing a new song from the one they sang at the National Conference in 2014 where the ACF was presented as an organisation and its top echelons not only in attendance but with its equals and peers from different parts of the country- Afenifere, Ohaneze, South-South and Middle Belt leaders- forming an official group of 50 wise men and women who ensured consensus after or before heated plenary debates and exchanges.\n\nOne of the key issues in the consensual resolutions of the conference was the adoption of the North/South zoning of Nigeria presidency at the end of a maximum tenure of eight years. The desire for a continuous bite at the cherry is the cause of the dilemma. It is a matter of honour.\n\nNigeria, we hail thee.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "2023: Where are the masquerades? [Opinion]",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Dakuku Peterside\n\nTHERE are masquerades in every culture and the life of every individual. The masquerades wear masks for different reasons \u2013 from prevarication, illusion, fantasy, fright, horror, to protection. No matter the reason, masquerades thrive by covering who they are and taking up a persona unique to the image they want to portray.\n\nThis image becomes the identity of the masquerade. And the persona behind the masquerade dies for the masquerades persona to live. In most cultures, it is taboo to unmask the masquerade. Even at the threat of losing life, a masquerade will fight to hide the person\u2019s identity behind the mask.\n\nIn the past, masquerades were a rarity and often appeared on special occasions and festivities. Nowadays, both literally and metaphorically, we are all masquerades. We wear masks these days as a necessity. Facial mask existed before COVID-19, but COVID, at best, only heightened its usage. Mask during this pandemic era has become a symbol of self-preservation against a deadly viral infection. Aside from literal masks, we wear \u2018symbolic masks\u2019 to protect ourselves from emotional and psychological elements that we confront daily \u2013 financial secrets, relationship secrets, and privacy of life and family.\n\nAs the drumbeat of the 2023 election dance started, we have seen big \u201cpolitical masquerades\u201d coming out to declare their interest in the struggle for power and relevance.\n\nAcross party lines, powerful politicians, likened to big masquerades, and their cohorts are showcasing introductory and essential aspects of their election dance and using both old and novel gimmicks to make known their interest in the presidency of Nigeria.\n\nSome have visited the incumbent President to tell him of their ambition; some are still consulting with stakeholders; some are waiting for the call of God and their people to declare their intention publicly, while others have gone ahead to make public their presidential ambition via the mass media.\n\nSo far, there are no surprises yet. Those who have declared or those rumoured to be on the verge of announcing their intentions to rule Nigeria are the same old political warhorses and, to a great extent, are known by Nigerians. We expect more to declare in the coming days and weeks.\n\nThis is part of the political process, and any Nigerian is free to aspire to become the president and compete for the post through any political platform of his choice. In Nigeria, at least for now, only masquerades wearing the masks of APC or PDP are considered to have realistic chances of winning the presidential elections. But these are early days, and a third force political platform may challenge this status quo. It is about 12 months to the general election for Nigerians to choose the leader of the most populous black nation on earth at a time of significant political, social, and economic turbulence.\n\nNigeria faces, on all sides, existential threats that will require a highly-skilled, competent and charismatic leader to galvanise all the human and natural resources at our disposal to tackle the vast socio-economic challenges confronting us. Among these \u201cmasquerades\u201d declaring their interest, one will emerge as the leader.\n\nThis underscores the importance of galvanising Nigerians with outstanding leadership and empathic qualities to step up to the arena and be counted. One must be in the race to win. Nigerians often complain about the same old leaders taking political offices and doing nothing innovative to develop the country but forget that it all starts with the calibre and quality of politicians coming out for the presidency. It is from that group that the president will emerge.\n\nTherefore, I implore all Nigerians to use this opportunity to encourage proven leaders with the proper knowledge and skills to come on board to compete for the presidency. Nigeria now more than ever before needs quality leadership at the highest level. It is a positive for democracy that so many citizens are stepping forward to lead the nation, indicating increasing political participation. However, nothing yet distinguishes one aspirant from another in terms of either ideology or public policy leaning.\n\nFor now, we are stuck at the level of personality cults, geopolitical interests, and ethnic entitlement syndrome. Even where aspirants are from different party platforms, their utterances do not yet reflect the broad agenda of those parties. More disturbingly, there is nothing that indicates depth on specific national issues from any aspirant. So far, not less than six \u201cpolitical masquerades\u201d have declared their interest from the two main political parties \u2013 APC (Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, David Umahi, and Orji Uzor Kalu) and PDP (Abubarkar Bukola Saraki, Anyim Pius Anyim, and Dele Momodu).\n\nThere are other candidates with near unassailable profile in the fringe parties. It is time Nigerians started examining all of them from the prism of our complexities. Let us look at \u2018the stuff they are made of\u2019, those who gave them the masquerade and are in their company. We want to know what they are offering and what vision they are selling to Nigerians? How will they solve the multiplicity of Nigerian problems? We should not focus on inanities like what their religion is. What geopolitical zone they represent and what financial muscle they have.\n\nLet the presidential \u201cmasquerades\u201d come forth and canvas ideas and proffer solutions. Twelve months is enough time to know which of these political masquerades we want to take seriously or ignore. For the political masquerades that have declared their intention, let us now hear their ideas. However, I acknowledge by trend analysis, that it is not the candidate with the most brilliant takes on issues that will win, as the factors that determine who wins elections in Nigeria do not have much to do with sound policy ideas.\n\nUnlike the previous election period, Nigeria is in a precarious situation; inexperience, vacuity, incompetence, lack of proven service record, absence of ideas to drive positive change among candidates will not be overlooked or tolerated by Nigerians. Between June and August this year, the parties will present masquerades dressed in party attire. Our options will be limited to the masquerades presented to the electorate by the parties. To a certain degree, the party will shield the person behind the masquerade from Nigerians. We may be denied the opportunity of knowing what the one behind the masquerade said as distinct from what the masquerade said.\n\nThe party-political machinery takes over immediately after primaries, and all forms of spin doctors and election pundits are engaged to convince the electorate of the rightfulness of the candidates. This powerful party campaign machinery will set out to use unfounded marketing tools, lies, half-truths, innuendoes, and propaganda to convince or confuse the electorate to vote for its candidate even though he/she may have apparent shortcomings that make him unfit for the presidency.\n\nThat is why when a president is elected, there are lots of things the electorate assumes he said or stood for or championed that turns out completely different from what the president does. Maybe it is still too early in the day, but I strongly feel that now is the time to engage with the masquerades and try to figure out the man behind the mask.\n\nOur current crisis correlates with the electoral decisions and leadership choices we have collectively made in the past. All elections have serious consequences. This underscores the importance of careful consideration of the masquerades to eliminate the wrong candidates from the presidential race and have people with clarity of vision, proven leadership skills and a good knowledge of the Nigerian context vis a vis the complexity of our religious, social, and ethnic makeup.\n\nThe only actual path forward is using the 2023 election to usher in good leadership with a demonstrable capacity to implement a pan-Nigeria agenda. Nigeria is in dire need of positive change. But who will drive this change? More of the same masquerades \u2013 Nigeria\u2019s political elite. Unpleasant and scary as today\u2019s Nigeria has become, our present reality should force us to question our prior assumptions about leadership selection. We should not allow primordial sentiments to becloud our judgement in seeking out and choosing a competent and visionary leader as president.\n\nWe have a choice now facing all Nigerians: we can make use of the next 12 months to put our acts together and engage in positive politicking to seek out good leaders for the 2023 general elections, or we can decide to play politics as usual without seriously considering post-election governance. Elections are a means to an end and not an end in themselves. If we do not elect good leaders, we will bear the brunt of the consequences \u2013 debilitating poverty, insecurity, unemployment, and constant internal crisis and call for secession. We are at the beginning of electing the president of Nigeria.\n\nWe must get it right at this stage to have a realistic chance of electing a president that will make a difference. There is no doubt that the flawed election process in Nigeria is probably the cause of failed governance and leadership in the country. I argue that we must reassess that process and start on time to get it right if we must make meaningful progress in getting the right president.\n\nThe president derives his power from the people who vote for him and elect him to lead them in a democracy. So, the president rises and falls with the people. A government by the people, as represented by a voted president, contextually assumes responsibility for the success or failure of the people. Democracy affords the people an opportunity to hold the president accountable through periodic elections. 2023 is another opportunity for the people to get it right.\n\nNigerians must carefully choose a leader with incredible qualities to take Nigeria to a new frontier. What are these qualities we require of the next president? The aspirant must have a clear vision of where he wants to take Nigeria in terms of development and how he will achieve that given our current resource realities. The aspirant must have proven skills and competencies in management and leadership.\n\nHe must have empathy for the plights of many Nigerians and must have a burning desire to work to ameliorate the sufferings.

          "title": "Adebanjo, Clark, Amechi, Yakasai at their sunset (2)",
          "text": "\n\nBy Eric Teniola\n\nThe first part of this piece published last week focused on how these leaders have been influencing activities in the nation, even at the sunset of their lives.\n\nCHIEFClark helped in building the Midwest College of Technology that later metamorphosed into the University of Benin (after the failure of several efforts to affiliate the fledgling school to the University of Ibadan and Ife). He was later appointed pro-chancellor, chairman, governing council of the university (1970-1975).\n\nDuring his tenure as pro-chancellor, Chief Clark gave scholarships to students of what we now regard as North West and South East.\n\nHe was Minister for Information under General Yakubu Gowon till the latter was overthrown by General Murtala Ramat Muhammad (November 8, 1938 \u2013February 13, 1976), in 1975. Chief Clark was elected a senator in the Bendel Delta zone on August 20, 1983 along with 60 other NPN senators, and was sworn in on October 7, 1983, by the then Senate President, the late Dr Joseph Wayas.\n\nI covered the swearing-in ceremony on that day. He served for three months before President Shehu Aliyu Usman Shagari was overthrown by Major General Muhammadu(79). Chief Clark was very prominent during the tenure of President Goodluck Jonathan (64).\n\nBeginning in 1996, Chief Clark has been a self-described leader of the Ijaw nation. He supported the Ijaw ethnic group in Delta State during an ethnic crisis in Warri and has led Ijaw leadership delegations to meet political leaders.\n\nChief Amechi is the Dara Akunwafor of Ukpor, Ichie (the headquarters of Nnewi South Local Government Area in Anambra State). He lost his wife, Priscilla Chinelo Okoye, whom he married in 1960, recently.\n\nChief Amechi was educated at the Catholic School, Umunuko, Ukpor, 1937-1943 and Etukokwu College, Onitsha(1944-1948). He was principal organising secretary, National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons, NCNC(1955-1959); secretary-general, Zikist Movement(1960-1963); national publicity secretary, NCNC, 1964-1966; parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Information(1960-1962); minister of state for ports(1964-1966); member, National Party of Nigeria, NPN( 1979-1983); executive member, Strategy Committee, NPN(1979-1983); director, Nigeria Railway Corporation.\n\nRecently, Chief Amechi led the South-East leaders to President Muhammadu Buhari to The Villa, to plead for the release of Nnamdi Kanu. In 1966, a similar futile plea was made for the release of Major Isaac Jasper Adaka-Boro (1938-1968). Also in 1995, another futile global plea was made for the release of Chief Kenure Beeson Saro-Wiwa(1941-1995). Chief Adebanjo from Isanya-Ogbo near Ijebu Ode, is presently the leader of the Afenifere, a socio-cultural organisation for the Yoruba people of Nigeria.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nFive factors will determine #NigeriaDecides2023\n\nThe Afenifere was formed in 1998 with Chief Abraham Adesanya as the leader and the late Chief Bola Ige as the deputy leader. Other founding members were Pa Onasanya, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, Wunmi Adegbonmire, Okunrounmu Femi, Ganiyu Dawodu, Olanihun Ajayi, Olu Falae, Adebayo Adefarati and Ayo Adebanjo.\n\nOther Afenifere members that joined include Dipo Olaitan, Senator Mojisola Akinfenwa, Chief Olusegun Osoba, Senator Bayo Salami, Prince Dayo Adeyeye(publicity secretary), Chief Supo Sonibare, Chief (Mrs) Kofo Bucknor Akerele, Chief George Akosile, Chief Nathaniel Aina, Chief S.K. Babalola, Mr. Korede Duyile, Mr. Jimi Agbaje (treasurer), Mr. Iyiola Omisore, Professor Aikuola, Alhaji Lam Adesina, Chief Segun Ojo (protem financial secretary), Chief Ayo Opadokun (protem general secretary), Professor Bolaji Akinyemi (head of the think-tank), Chief Gbenga Kaka, Chief Cornelius Adebayo, Senator Farunkanmi, Babatunde Oduyoye, Afuye as well as NADECO officials in exile. In this group we have Professor Wole Soyinka, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and others whose efforts were appreciated.\n\nAfenifere was re-grouped after the demise of Pa Adekunle Ajasin and its monthly meetings were held in Ijebu Igbo. Alhaji Ganiu Dawudu was the leader of the Group in Lagos. The weekly caucus meeting of the group is held every Monday at the Surulere, Lagos, house of Pa Onasanya. Other members were Chief Aikulola, Prof. Akin Onigbinde, Chief Lere Adebayo, and Dr. Gbola Adetunji. Chief Kole Omololu, the Atunluse of Osoro kingdom in Ondo State who was based in London, was introduced to the group by Chief Olu Falae.\n\nChief Bola Tinubu was absorbed into Afenifere when he returned to Nigeria after the demise of General Sani Abacha (September 20, 1943 \u2013 June 8, 1998). Chief Cornelius Adebayo, former Governor of Kwara State, was the chairman of its political committee. A lot has been written on Chief Ayo Adebanjo and he too has said a lot about himself and his stand on issues almost on daily basis. He is a man who is never afraid of controversy.\n\nDuring the treasonable felony trial in 1963, Chief Adebanjo was in Ghana with Chief Samuel Goomsu Ikoku (1922-1997). On a personal note, while in Ghana, he formed a personal relationship with my uncle, Chief Edward Afolabi Abimbola, the Lijofi of Idanre, who died at 87 in August 2017. Chief Abimbola was the Managing Director of EAACO Company, which established a bicycle factory in Accra, Ghana, on January 17, 1969, and also assembled gas cookers, refrigerators and electric cookers in Ghana at that time.\n\nChief Adebanjo was present in all the funeral events of Chief Abimbola. Several times when I visited his house in Surulere before his death, Chief Abimbola revealed to me how generous Chief Adebanjo is and how principled and objective he was as a friend to him.\n\nAlhaji Tanko Yakasai is the fourth among those I regard as the last link with the present generation. I have known Alhaji Yakasai since 1976. He was very close to Alhaji Mamoud Waziri, Alhaji Gidado Idris, Alhaji Gambo Jimeta, Alhai Uba Ahmed and Dr. Abubakar Olusola Saraki. Always at alert, he reads constantly. Years ago we usually meet at the Roman Garden House, Victoria Island, Lagos, office of Alhaji Mahmoud Waziri.\n\nAlhaji Tanko Yakasai had his elementary education at the Shahuchi Elementary school, Kano, 1934-1937, Shahuchi Evening School, Kano, Wilhelm Pieck Institute, East Germany, (Diploma in Political Science).\n\nIn 1946, there emerged some radicals in Kano, they formed the Northern Elements Progressive Association (NEPA). The radicals include Habib Raji Abddallah, Abubakar Zukogi and Abdurrahman Bida. It was the NEPA that gave birth to the Northern Elements Progressive Union, which was launched in Kano on August 8, 1950.\n\nThe Party was headed by the Headmaster of Maru Teachers College, the legendary Malam Aminu Kano (9 August 1920, Kano- 17 April 1983, Kano along with Malam Sa\u2019ad Zungur, the NCNC Federal Secretary. Eight other radicals founded the NEPU then. They are Bello Ijumu, Abba Maikwaru, Mudi Sipikin, Magaji Dnbatta, Babaliya Manaja, Musa Kaula, Abdulkadir Danjai and Garba Bida.\n\nThe executive members of NEPU at that time were Malam Yerima Bella (Vice President General), Malam Abubakar Zukogi(General Secretary), Malam Yahaya Sabo, Alhaji Salihu Nakande(Treasurer), Alhaji Ahmadu Tireda(Assistant Treasurer), Malam Shehu Sataima (Financial Secretary General), Malam Tanko Yankasai (National Publicity Secretary), Malam Ibrahim Heebah( Administrative Secretary), Malam Yahaya Abdullahi (Political Secretary to the President General), Malam Lawal Dan-Bazau (Adviser on Moslem Law), Malam Adamu Jaririand, Malam Abubakar Tanbuwal (Auditor), Malama Gambo Sawaba, Malam M.B. Yunusa and Malam Saliu Tate( National Field Secretaries).\n\nIn November 1956 election to the Northern House of Assembly was held. The Government Party, the Northern People\u2019s Congress (N.P.C.) won the election with 100 seats out of 131 elected seats.\n\nBut for this first time the Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) secured five seats in the Regional legislature, the United Middle Belt Congress twelve, the Bornu Youth Movement-two and the Action Group- four.\n\nThe ideology of NEPU was socialist economics, social liberalism and democratic humanism. It became the main opposition party in Northern Nigeria after the region was granted self-governance in the 1950s.\n\nIn the First Republic, it maintained a steady alliance with the Zikist National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) against the Northern People\u2019s Congress (NPC)-dominated Federal Government.\n\nOther members of NEPU at that time were Malama Gambo Sawaba, Malam Ladi Shehu, Alhaji Ali Chindo, Alhaji Shehu Gombe, Malam Lamin Sanusi, Alhaji Mudi Lagos, Malam Abba Zakar, Malam Isa Yaro, Malam A.k. Danjaji, Malam Danladi Tudun Nufawa, Malam Uba Na Alkassim, Malam Adamu Gaya, Malam Babandije Jimeta, Malam Bala Keffi, Malam Ango Soba, Malam Garba Danbera, Malam Muhammadu Achichi, Malam Ben Wafi Bida, Malam Ali Dakata, Malam Sambo Barka, Malam Mamudu Tireda, Malam Buba Hadejia, Malam Yusufu Hadejia and Malam Baba Dan Agudi.\n\nIt was the NEPU that issued the Sawaba Declaration; a proclamation of a political front calling for a socialist revolution in Northern Nigeria. Malam Aminu Kano translated the original Hausa document published by the party in 1953 called on the \u2018Talakawa\u2019 or populace to launch a \u2018class struggle against the ruling class.\n\nAt the Lafia Convention of 1953, NEPU endorsed the declaration, including it in its the manifesto of 1954.\n\nThe Declaration of Principles states that the shocking state of social order as at present existing in Northern Nigeria is due to nothing but the family compact rule of the so-called Native Administration in their present autocratic form;\n\nThat owing to the unscrupulous and vicious system of administration by the family compact rulers and which has been established and fully supported by the British imperialist government, there is today in our society an antagonism of interest, manifesting itself as a class struggle, between the members of the vicious circle of Native Administration on the one hand and the ordinary talakawa on the other hand;\n\nThat this antagonism can be abolished only by the emancipation of the talakawa from the domination of the privileged few and by the reform of the present autocratic political institutions placing their democratic control in the hands of the talakawa for whom alone they exist;That this emancipation must be the work of the talakawa themselves;\n\nThat as at present, the machinery of government including the armed forces of the nation, exist only to conserve the privilege of this selfish minority group, the talakawa must organize consciously and politically for the conquest of the powers of government both nationally and locally in order that this machinery of government, including these forces, may be converted from an instrument of oppression into the agent of emancipation, and the overthrow of the bureaucracy and autocratic privilege;\n\nThat all political parties are the expression of class interest and as the interest of the talakawa is diametrically opposed to the interest of all sections of the master class, both white and black, the party seeking the emancipation of the talakawa must naturally be hostile to the party oppressors; the Northern Element Progressive Union of Northern Nigeria, therefore being the only political party of the talakawa enters the field of political action determined to reduce to nonentity any party of hypocrites and the traitors to our mother country, and calls upon all the sons and daughters of Northern Nigeria to muster under its banner to the end, that a speedy termination may be wrought to this vicious system of administration which deprive them of the fruits of their labour, and that as poverty may give place to comfort, privilege to equality and political, economic and social slavery to freedom.\n\nIncidentally, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai was one of the people that wrote and defended the Sawaba declaration.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1956, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai was the National Chairman of the NEPU Youth Association, National Secretary, Northern Elements Progressive Union, 1955-1958, National Chairman NCNC/NEPU Youth Association and the Secretary-General, Sawaba Party of Nigeria between 1961 and 1962.\n\nAlhaji Tanko Yakasai was often imprisoned for his NEPU activities along with Sani Gezawa and Abubakar Zukogi.\n\nIt is the spirit of that declaration that is still enduring in Kano till today. Although radicalism had been in Kano for a long time before the Sawaba Declaration, it was the declaration that fuelled radicalism the more in Kano.\n\nHaving lived in Kano for some years, I realized that there are two groups in Kano, a group of the extremely wealthy and a group of the extremely poor. Occasionally when these two groups clash, Kano erupts under a simple excuse. The root of this constant clash may be traced to the Sawaba declaration.\n\nIt was the spirit of the Sawaba that made Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Rimi(1940-2010) to be governor of Kano state in 1979 and it was the same spirit that made the PRP to win all the five senate seats in Kano in 1979.\n\nIt was the spirit of the Sawaba declaration that made it impossible for President Shehu Shagari to have 25 per cent in Kano in the 1979 Presidential election and also made Alhaji Sabo Barkin Zuwo to be elected governor in 1983 in Kano state.\n\nEvery Kano state citizen whether he has read it or not believes in the Sawaba declaration. It is the declaration that has encouraged radicalism in Kano. If you read fully the Sawaba declaration, you will not be surprised about the social crises now ravaging most parts of the old Northern Nigeria.\n\nIn 1966, the military overthrew the civilian government and in 1967, Kano state was created by General Yakubu Gowon. General Gowon then appointed Alhaji Audu Bako as the Military Governor of Kano state. Governor Bako later appointed Alhaji Yakasai as the Commissioner for Information, 1967-1971, commissioner for Co-operatives, 1971-1972 and commissioner for finance, 1972-1975. In spite of criticisms, Audu Bako\u2019s administration is today still remembered in Kano for his positive achievements.\n\nAfter his death in 1980, the Tiga irrigation dam built during his governorship was renamed the Audu Bako Dam.\n\nIn 1979, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai did not join the People\u2019s Redemption Party of Alhaji Aminu Kano but the likes of S.G. Ikoku, Kanmi Ishola-Oshobu, Ibrahim Barau, A.D. Yahaya, Una Akpan, Dr. Kolabogdi, Adamu Gaya, Ahmed Zakari, Hamisu Musa, Usman A. Dambata, Sabo Barkin Zuwo, Abubakar Rimi, Balarabe Musa(21 August 1936- 11 November 2020) had surrounded Alhaji Aminu Kano by then. President Shehu Shagari later appointed Alhaji Yakasai as the special assistant on National Assembly Matters.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Alhaji Usman Shehu Aliyu Shagari on December 31st, 1983 by Major General Muhammadu Buhari, Alhaji Tanko Yankasai was detained like many other politicians in Nigeria then.\n\nTill today, he is still bitter about his political persecution. In 1992, during the failed Presidential campaign, Alhaji Yankasai aligned with his close friend, Dr. Abubakar Olusola Saraki (1933-2012), the late Waziri of Ilorin in his Presidential bid.\n\nThat was when I became closer to Alhaji Yankasai. We met at flat 18, the ninth floor of the Roman Garden House and we were usually hosted by the personal assistant to Alhaji Mahmoud Waziri in the person of Mr Vincent Usoho to discuss issues.\n\nFrequent visitors to that flat 18 at that time were Chief Harry Akande, Alao Aka- Basorun, Comrade, Uche Chukwumerije, Femi Falana, Alhaji Abubakar Rimi, Professor Biliaminu, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, Major General Shehu Musa Yar\u2019adua, General Gibson Sanda Jallo. Alhaji Mahmoud Ata, Chief Sunday Awoniyi, Dr Bukola Saraki, Beko Ransom-Kuti and others.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1995, he was a member of the Nigerian Constitutional Conference; a delegate Nigerian National Conference in 2014 and also a member National Conference Consensus Building Group in 2014. It is good even at the age of 95; a man like Alhaji Tanko Yakasai is still talking about National issues. For if my observation is correct, only a few people now talk or advise this Central Government.\n\nMost people have realized that it is useless and a waste of time to talk to a government that does not listen. As far as this government is concerned, there is no dialogue.\n\nSo I must commend Alhaji Tanko Yakasai and his colleagues, Chief Adebanjo, Chief Amechi and Chief Clark that who are still concerned about the future of this country.\n\nNigeria seems to be in a dilemma now. The Nigeria train is moving at a fast speed to a KAPUT destination.\n\nThe question now is, is Nigeria now a failed state or a fragile state? According to a recent analysis by World Bank, \u201ca fragile state or weak state is a country characterized by weak state capacity or weak state legitimacy leaving citizens vulnerable to a range of shocks. While many countries are making progress toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, a group of 35 to 50 countries (depending on the measure used) are falling behind.\n\nIt is estimated that out of the world\u2019s seven billion people, 26% live in fragile states, and this is where one-third of all people surviving on less than US$1.25 per day live, half of the world\u2019s children who die before the age of five, and one-third of maternal deaths occur.\n\nA fragile state is significantly susceptible to the crisis in one or more of its sub-systems. It is a state that is particularly vulnerable to internal and external shocks and domestic and international conflicts. Fragile states are not only evaluated by the degree of fragility but also types of state fragility and the threat they pose are to help policymakers to appropriate responses.\n\nIn a fragile state, institutional arrangements embody and perhaps preserve the conditions of crisis: in economic terms, this could be institutions (importantly, property rights) that reinforce stagnation or low growth rates, or embody extreme inequality (in wealth, in access to the property and land ownership, in access to the means to make a living); in social terms, institutions may embody extreme inequality or lack of access altogether to health or education; in political terms, institutions may entrench exclusionary coalitions in power (in ethnic, religious, or perhaps regional terms), or extreme factionalism or significantly fragmented security organisations.\n\nIn fragile states, statutory institutional arrangements are vulnerable to challenges by rival institutional systems be they derived from traditional authorities, devised by communities under conditions of stress that see little of the state (in terms of security, development or welfare), or be they derived from warlords, or other non-state power brokers.\n\nFragile states might also offer citizens multiple, overlapping institutions from highly variant power sources that are competing for legitimacy. While, as opposed to a weak state, these different institutions might not be in direct conflict, they do offer strong competing narratives that hamper the progress of good governance.\n\nA fragile state is an analytical category that gained prominence from the mid-1990s onwards and gained further traction after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The background is the belief held by many policy-makers and academics alike that the potential for contemporary conflict is harboured within, not between, states.\n\nLow capacity and low-income states of the Global South are thought to pose direct threats not only to their own populations but by extension also to their neighbouring Western countries. Following this logic, fragile states are in need of development in order to be able to provide security and basic services to their citizens, decreasing vulnerability and increasing resilience to internal and external shocks.\n\nIn this way, fragile states exhibit a series of similar threats as failed states, but at a markedly lower magnitude. Their failures are an effective omen of what is to come if their administrative course remains unaltered.\u201d\n\nFor sure Nigeria is in the category of countries listed above either as failed or fragile.\n\nEric Teniola, a former director at the Presidency, wrote from Lagos.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

They were carrying sticks and even fuel. They went straight to the altar and were almost halfway there.\n\n\u201cThey approached our parish priest, Rev Fr Joseph and asked him why he was celebrating Mass on a day when their master was going to court. They were quite a number of them and were visibly angry.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the church took to their heels. There would have been a stampede because there were a lot of people in the mass today. I ran to a building close to the church.\n\n\u201cFather Joseph told them we were holding mass today to pray for the release of Nnamdi Kanu. He used diplomacy to talk to them, and even asked them if they were really for Ndi Igbo or against Ndi Igbo? They now said okay, that if so, the people in the church was for them.\n\n\u201cThey now called back everyone to continue the mass that they were now convinced that the church people were Biafrans. Some of us were so afraid that we could not return, so we went home from there. They apologized to the priest and left.\n\n\u201cThe same group went out and saw a tricycle rider. No one knows why the man was outside because, on sit at home days, you hardly find a tricycle outside. They beat up the man and burnt his tricycle, and the tricycle is still there now smoking,\u201d the source recounted.",

          "text": "Each time Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu makes a move to advance his political interests, his traducers come out of hiding, red-eyed and begin to spin all sorts of outlandish tales by moonlight to deceive their gullible audience and cast a dent on the man\u2019s personality.\n\nThat has been Asiwaju\u2019s cross to carry since 1999 when he emerged as Lagos State Governor till date. In the last 20 years, no other politician has had to contend with barrage of relentless and caustic criticisms, largely borne out of unrestrained envy and sheer ignorance. And here is a man, who has been out of public office since 2007, yet looms large in the consciousness of his lovers and haters 14 good years down the line.\n\nBut, like a duck that keeps shaking off the water poured on it, Asiwaju Tinubu has handled criticisms of his person and style with utmost equanimity. That has even riled his critics the more. Fact remains that this is no just an ordinary politician; he is a phenomenon by every definition of the word.\n\nFor the past couple of days, Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s declaration of intent to run for the nation\u2019s number one seat has been the main topical issue on the lips of Nigerians, both in low and high places. And the critics are at it again, regurgitating old tales and lies, most of which had been subjected to the strictest official and legal scrutiny, but crashed like a pack of poorly arranged cards.\n\nLet\u2019s properly examine the two lies being bandied around and lay the facts bare. First, is the issue of his Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s net-worth. For the younger generation, who may not be familiar with Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s career and political trajectory, here are the facts.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) joined politics in the late 80\u2019s as a rich man; not as \u201cI never chop\u201d hustler as we say in street lingo. His successful career at ExxonMobil is an open secret. Before joining Mobil, Asiwaju Tinubu had worked in world-renowned Accounting firms, which included Arthur Anderson, Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and GTE Services Corporation.\n\nThis is a man well grounded in financial investments and could not by any standard be described as a \u201cpoor man,\u201d except those who have taken it as a career of sorts to keep levelling unsubstantiated allegations and digging mud to unearth Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s \u201cdirt.\u201d One thing is clear though: they will continue to reach a dead-end in their fruitless expedition.\n\nAs a member of the defunct Primose Group in Lagos State, Asiwaju Tinubu was a major financial pillar of the influential political group, which gave the dominant Jakande/Agbalajobi a run for its money in the battle for the control of Lagos politics in the early 90\u2019s.\n\nFast forward to the mid-90s. In the battle for the restoration of the June 12 mandate of Chief MKO Abiola and subsequent formation of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), Asiwaju Tinubu again stepped up to the plate. He bankrolled the activities of the pro-democracy group for over five years, a fact that eminent statesmen, including Professor Wole Soyinka and Gen. Alani Akinrinade (rtd) have repeatedly stated at various public fora.\n\nOut of office as governor since 2007, no law prevents Asiwaju Tinubu from leveraging on his brand name and contacts to engage in legitimate businesses. As a financial expert of many decades of experience, he understands the bolts and nuts of money and financial management. We are talking of a man who is a Management and Tax expert here. One that is still consulting for many governments in Africa on revenue matters. He was so successful with financial re-engineering of Lagos State such that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) came to understudy and copied his template.\n\nIn advanced democracies like the United States,\u2019 many former public officials become wealthy out of office by tapping into their rich reservoir of contacts to set up consulting firms that seal multi-million dollar deals for Wall Street and other multinational companies. Many former US public officials like Secretaries of State, Defence, Treasury etc set up consulting businesses that work for foreign governments. Former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair runs Tony Blair Associates (TBA) as a global consultancy providing services to governments and international organisations around the world. In the same vein, Madeliene Albright, former US Secretary of State, is the Chairman of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global advisory company she set up with her partners after leaving office. The firm advises multinationals, financial institutions, governments and non-profit organisations.\n\nAsiwaju Tinubu has not been idle since he left office. Apart from his consultancy business and other commercial interests, he wrote: \u2018Financialism: Water From Empty Well\u2019, a book he co-authored with Brian Browne, a former US Senior Diplomat, who once served as Consul General of U.S Embassy in Nigeria. The ideas in the book are bold and unorthodox because the authors challenged contemporary global financial and economic convention and exposed how the financial system drains the economy.\n\nNow to the issue of the \u2018bullion van\u2019 found in Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s Lagos residence on the eve of the 2019 Presidential Elections. It is quite unfortunate that many Nigerians have continued to display their ignorance with glee, particularly on matters they lack knowledge of and are at liberty to seek proper education.\n\nLet us put the issue in proper context: is the presence of a bullion van in a private residence, particularly in a home belonging to a high profile/networth personality a crime? The answer is No! World over, rich individuals enjoy privileged banking which is also called \u201cprivate banking\u201d from their banks. That includes being provided premium banking services right in the comfort of their homes. It should also be stated that Mega churches use bullion van to move huge tithes and offering every Sunday. Many private businesses that generate huge daily cash use bullion van to move their cash to bank. There is a reason banks provide private banking service. There is also a reason why wealthy men and women like Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola and Folorunsho Alakija can never be found in banking halls like \u2018ordinary Nigerians.\u2019\n\nIn this instance, the bullion van was seen in the premises of a high networth man, who also doubles as the National Leader of the ruling party and was the co-Chairman of his party\u2019s National Campaign Council.\n\nElections require huge logistics, from mobilisation of thousands of party agents, movement of party officials for election monitoring, to mention but a few. As the co-Head of the APC Presidential Campaign Council in 2019, it was Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s duty to make sure everything work out as planned, a task he fully accomplished.\n\nAs the 2023 elections draws closer, only the naive still living in a world of illusion would expect that Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s critics would simmer down. That won\u2019t happen for as long as the man his critics love to hate, but whom majority also love with passion, continue to dominate discussions and newspaper headlines as he marches steadily to the Presidential Villa as Nigeria\u2019s next President and Commander-in-Chief come 2023.",

          "title": "2023: No ethnic group can handpick presidential candidate \u2013 Anyim",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nFormer Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim, has said no ethnic group can handpick the presidential candidate of any political party or ask an aspirant to step down for a preferred individual.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV yesterday, Anyim, who recently declared his ambition to contest for the presidency in 2023 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said though southern Nigeria should be the region to produce the president, he was concerned about making himself acceptable to all zones in the country.\n\n\u201cI want to say we may come from the South East but we are from Nigeria and whoever must be the president of Nigeria must not be whoever the South East hand picks. I am very concerned about making myself acceptable to South East, North East, South West, South South, North West and North Central zone because I am seeking to be the president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can say straight away is that at the primary level, everyone will emerge from his own party and I do not see how any ethnic group will come and decide for the parties who to be their candidate or how they would ask somebody to step down for someone they have preferred to be their candidate. I don\u2019t know how that would work and I don\u2019t want to get into that. I want to say that my commitment is to preside over Nigeria and I must be acceptable by every part of the country.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of Igbo presidency, Anyim said the country\u2019s constitution mandates that every aspect of governance must reflect federal character and since the presidency has been in the North, it was the turn of the South.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe issue of equity, fairness and justice is certainly a fundamental one. In 1999, when the two presidential candidates emerged from the South West, eventually, Olusegun Obasanjo became the president and he was president of Nigeria and not president of South West. In fact, most of his votes came from outside the South West and that is the reason why it is very critical that every person aspiring should realise that equity, fairness and justice is a fundamental issue.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s constitution mandates that every aspect of governance must reflect federal character. So, what we are saying is that the presidency has been in the North and it is now the turn of the South and that makes sense. In the constitution of the PDP, which is my party, zoning of elective offices is very clear and it is between the North and the South. I have heard people say there are other zones like the North East and North Central that haven\u2019t produced president but that is not the issue. The zoning principle in the PDP constitution is that rotation is between the north and the south. When it gets to the South, they can micro zone it. It is only fair that every section of the country must have a sense of belonging. The rules have been established and not following it will be a burden on the conscience of the nation.\u201d\n\nAnyim said blame for the recurring incidents of budget padding should not be heaped on the National Assembly but on occupants of the presidential villa.\n\n\u201cWhatever is happening in the National Assembly is a function of the character in the (Presidentioal) Villa. During my time in the Senate, we didn\u2019t have any budget issues as such and the way budgets are implemented are not the same.\n\nWhen Obasanjo was president, the National Assembly had peculiar challenges of its own. When Goodluck was president, the National Assembly had the best of times. The summary of my position is that whatever you see happening in the National Assembly is a function of the character in the villa,\u201d Anyim said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum (MBF) has warned that any attempt to truncate the rotation of power shift to the South in 2023 would lead to anarchy that may cause the disintegration of the country.\n\nThe regional group was responding to the resolution passed by the Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF) under the auspices of Northern Leaders of Thought (NLT) at the end of its meeting in Kaduna State, where it opposed power shift in 2023.\n\nHowever, the MBF, through its national president, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said any threat to power shift to the South was akin to courting frightening dangers to the unity and progress of the country.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cConsidering the circumstances under which the group met and membership of those who attended the meeting on January 15, 2022 at the Arewa House in Kaduna, it is clear that there are subterranean forces aimed at frustrating the power shift arrangement to the South in 2023.\n\nBy May 2023, President Muhammadu Buhari, a northerner, should have completed two tenures of four years each as provided for in the Nigerian Constitution. To insist that another northerner should continue in power beyond May 2023 amounts to violating the arrangement on power shift that has become the norm since the return of democracy in May 1999.\n\n\u201cAs the umbrella organisation for all ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt, the MBF is confident that Nigeria is blessed with competent and qualified persons from all sections of the country who can offer altruistic leadership in advancing national development. Since 1999, power shift has not only ensured equity in power-sharing procedure between the North and South; it has also reduced tension amongst Nigeria\u2019s diverse ethnic groups in the struggle for power. After a careful perusal of the communique issued at the end of a hurriedly packaged meeting by the NLT, it is evidently clear that there is a grand ploy to truncate power shift to the South by 2023.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cWe recall that after our consultative meeting that took place in September 2021 in Akwanga, Nasarawa State, the Forum did not only express its resounding support for power rotation to the South, the MBF also noted that for fairness to hold sway, it was irretrievably necessary for power to return to the South in 2023.\n\n\u201cOur position was hinged on the fact that the power rotation has tremendously assisted in mitigating political tension by creating a platform for power-sharing in the country. As we have always declared in the past, the MBF wishes to restate once again that any threat against power shift to the South in 2023 is akin to courting frightening dangers to the unity and progress of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe stand for justice and freedom for all. The MBF is completely against the NLT\u2019s opposition to power shift in 2023. Those who met in Kaduna at the weekend must halt further attempts to create political turmoil for our nation.\n\n\u201cMembers of the NLT are not political leaders; they are forerunners of some nebulous political forces determined to foist fiery dark clouds over our country\u2019s political skies.

          "text": "To take plea Wednesday\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe arraignment of detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, on an amended 15-count charge was Tuesday stalled following an objection by his lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN).\n\nThe federal government had on Monday, January 17, barely 24 hours to the resumed trial of Kanu filed an amendment to the alleged terrorism charge against the separatist agitator.\n\nAlthough the judge had last November adjourned to January 19, 2022 to hear all pending applications regarding the suit, it however brought forward the hearing to January 18, following a request by Kanu\u2019s lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor.\n\nHowever, when the case was called, the prosecution counsel, Shuaib Labaran, informed the court of an amendment to the charge and prayed that the court direct its registrar to read the fresh charge to the defendant.\n\nIn a swift response, Ozekhome, who had earlier announced appearance for Kanu in the matter, objected to the request.\n\nHe claimed that it would be unfair and against the interest of justice if Kanu is allowed to take his plea on a charge he was only served Monday, adding that the proof of evidence was also not legible to allow them respond appropriately.\n\nOzekhome then pleaded with the court to allow them meet with Kanu, discuss the fresh charge so that he can take his plea Wednesday.\n\nSince the prosecution did not object to the short adjournment, the trial judge, Justice Binta Nyako, accordingly adjourned till Wednesday for arraignment on the 15 new charges.\n\nMeanwhile, the court directed that Kanu meet with his lawyers inside the court room for some minutes before been taken into custody by the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nThe amendment, which is the second in a space of roughly three months, is the sixth since the case was filed in 2015.\n\nKanu is standing trial on an amended seven-count criminal charge bordering on alleged terrorism and treasonable felony.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the charges read to him in October last year.\n\nHe was first arrested at a hotel in Lagos in 2015 when he sneaked into the country.\n\nKanu was initially arraigned alongside four others on a six-count charge, however, after he jumped his bail in September 2017, his trial was separated from the others and only resumed mid last year, following his rearrest and extradition to Nigeria.\n\nWhile he had pleaded guilty to the charges against him on one hand, he is also challenging the competent of the charge filed by the federal government, as well as the jurisdiction of the court to hear the suit, on the other.\n\nKanu, in the fresh charge, is being accused of intimidating and threatening that people will die including those who violated his sit-at-home directive.\n\nIn count four to seven, the IPOB leader was said to also make several broadcast between 2018 and 2021 wherein he incited members of the public in Nigeria to hunt and kill Nigerian security personnel, including police officers and their family members.\n\nIn count eight, Kanu was accused of directing members of IPOB to manufacture bombs, while he was in count nine accused of \u201cintent to destabilize the fundamental political and economic structures of Nigeria\u201d and inciting \u201cmembers of the public to stop the Anambra State elections\u201d and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 1 (2) (h) of the terrorism (Prevention) (Amendment) Act 2013\n\nIn count 10 to 12, the separatist agitator was also said to have incited members of the public to destroy public facilities and to stage a violent revolution in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the people of Nigeria.\n\nCount 13 says: \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, male, adult, of Afaranukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021 made a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to incite violence in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the people of Nigeria, you directed members of the public to burn down every federal facility in Lagos resulting in major economic loss to the federal government and you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 1 (2) (h) of the terrorism (Prevention) (Amendment) Act 2013.\u201d\n\nCount 14 says: \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, male, adult, of Afaranukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021 made a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, with intent to incite violence in

economic loss to the government and you thereby committed an offence punishable under section 1 (2) (h) of the terrorism (Prevention) (Amendment) Act 2013.\u201d\n\nCount 15 says: \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, male, adult, of Afaranukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between the month of March and April 2015 imported into Nigeria and kept in Ubulisiuzor in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, a radio transmitter known as Tram 50OL concealed in a container of used household items

          "text": "\u2022Alleges insiders sabotaged negotiation with criminals\n\n\u2022Promises to name terrorism collaborators, puts recent casualties at 58\n\n\u2022Terrorists have dislodged many villagers in Katsina, says Masari\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nZamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle, yesterday, gave a gloomy forecast about Nigeria\u2019s fight against banditry and terrorism, saying there is no indication that the hot weather of killing and plundering is nearing an end. Matawalle alleged that a secret backchannel peace negotiation with bandits broke down due to insider sabotage against his government.\n\nThe governor spoke at State House, Abuja, while addressing newsmen after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nMatawalle vowed to reveal the identities of those collaborating with terrorists to wreak havoc on Zamfara and other states. He put the casualty figure from the recent attacks in some parts of his state at 58, and not 200, as earlier reported.\n\nIn a related development, Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari said the persistent attacks on farming communities in the state by terrorists had led to the forceful eviction of many villagers. Masari stated this in Katsina, the state capital, when he received a national leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, at Government House. Tinubu was in the state on a condolence visit over the demise of the state Commissioner for Science, Technology and Innovations, Dr. Rabe Nasir.\n\nMatawalle lamented that terrorism in his state was not likely to end soon because of those behind it.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cWith the kind of people we have in Zamfara State, I don\u2019t think this issue of banditry will end very soon because, already, some people are behind it. Some people are using it. And all they need is, at least, to show Nigerians that both the federal and Zamfara State governments are not serious on the issue of insecurity, despite the fact that some of them are involved in the crisis of this insecurity. But we are doing our best.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said despite the activities of the terrorism sponsors, there would be a marked improvement in the security situation in the state this week.\n\nThe governor said Buhari had expressed the determination to strengthen security, explaining that this would bring changes in the situation.\n\nOn what could be done to bring a permanent solution to the insecurity in Zamfara, Matawalle declared, \u201cWhen I assumed duty as governor, I used so many options to bring this insecurity to a minimal level. First of all, I initiated dialogue and reconciliation between the herders and farmers and during that dialogue, we spent more than nine months without any crisis in Zamfara State. It worked.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, people used politics, because they have collaborators, of course. So, they went back to those bandits, telling them that the government is not serious about this dialogue; that we did not give them anything. So, the bandits decided to go back to their normal business.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I backed out from the reconciliation programme. But, definitely, it worked for over nine months. But because this is something that I inherited, that has been going on for almost eight years, and you don\u2019t expect it to end within just two years of my administration, because it is supposed to be an on-going process.\n\n\u201cSo, after I realised that some of them had backed out of this dialogue, I cut off the programme. I then initiated the cutting off of communications and some logistics that used to go to the bandits from August 2021 to December 2021. And it worked, too.\n\n\u201cBut sometimes those collaborators, who are usually happy with what is happening, who are even jubilating if people are being killed, went back and started again, saying that the government is not serious and instigating some of the public. In fact, they even dragged me to court.\u201d\n\nMatawalle, who said he came to the villa to brief Buhari on the latest attacks by bandits in the state, disputed the casualty figures earlier put out in news reports. He said, \u201cI briefed Mr. President on what happened and the next action that we should take and the government is doing everything possible to make sure that we bring sanity in state.\n\n\u201cAhamdullahi, all the action that we have taken, we have recorded successes within just three days. And you will bear me witness that after that attack, there has not been any report of any banditry activity in the state up till today.\u201d\n\nMatawalle added, \u201cI have already cleared the air about the figures, because I have seen some reporting that 200 people, 300 people, 500 people were killed. But I went to the community myself, and the security agencies.\n\n\u201cFirst, we went to Bungudu and we confirmed from the Emir that it was only 36 people that have been killed and two communities were razed by these bandits. And when we went to Anka, we met the Emir, and at the time we met him, he gave us a list of 22 people that have been killed, making the total number of 58 people killed.\n\n\u201cBut as I\u2019ve been saying, there are some political bandits, who have been spreading lies, rumours so that they can achieve some political gain. But actually it is just 58 people that have just been killed. But some people will just go to social media and be writing some figures and I have informed Mr. President of some people, who think that with this insecurity, they can achieve something out of it. I wonder how people will just be writing figures without having genuine information from those communities. Someone will just call media personnel and tell them so and so number of people have been killed in so and so place. Some people even swear with the Holy Koran that thousands of people had been been killed, which is grossly misleading. But we know all those kind of people do not want peace in the nation, but God will prevail Inshallah.\u201d\n\nThe governor reiterated that his government was investigating those, who might be collaborating with terrorists in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cLike I said, we are still investigating those that are involved in these activities and we will make the public know after the confirmation of the reality of all the information that we have at hand, because we are working to make sure that all those, who have a hand in this insecurity must be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cOnce the investigation is concluded, we will inform the public of the result of the investigation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his interaction with Buhari, Matawalle said the president had assured him on actions that would be taken soon to address insecurity in Zamfara State.\n\nHe said, \u201cI do initiate some actions to be taken and if I initiate, I do inform Mr. President, and I\u2019ve been getting support from him.\n\n\u201cSo, now, I initiated another option, which I informed him. The issue of security is not something that someone should be talking on television or pages of newspapers. But I assure the people Zamfara State that they will see changes very soon and Mr. President is committed to bringing down this issue of insecurity to barest level.\n\n\u201cI assure people that we have all it takes to fight these people and he has motivated me and when we go back, on Wednesday, the people will see changes between now and Wednesday. I know what we discussed and I know what is going to happen within this period. So, my people would be happy with the action that the federal government is going to take on the issue of insecurity very soon, Inshallah.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Masari lamented the security situation in his state, noting that Kankara and Faskari local government areas of the state are still under persistent attacks by terrorists due to their proximity to the forest linking Zamfara, Kaduna, Niger, and Kebbi states. The governor said the state government would not relocate the affected villagers, because relocating them to other communities would dislodge them socially and economically. He said such situation was dangerous.\n\nMasari, who spoke when he received Tinubu, said, \u201cToday, at least, Faskari and Kankara local governments are the worst hit. Even yesterday (Saturday) there was kidnapping in Faskari local government, because of their proximity to the forest that covers Zamfara, Kaduna, Niger, and Kebbi states.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are having persistent and consistent attacks within that belt. Many villagers have been dislodged. Luckily enough, within the last three weeks, we saw the return of most of them. We are working to see how they can return to their communities.\n\n\u201cBut the issue before us now is restoring confidence in the minds of the people to go back to their villages, because it is in their villages that they have the farms and their economic life is there. If you relocate them from there, you are not only socially relocating them but economically dislodging them, which is very dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe added that climate change was affecting the socio-economic activities of many villagers in the state, whom he said were not aware of the dangers associated with it.\n\nThe governor explained that the state government had established 34 weather-monitoring stations across the 34 local government areas of the state to tackle the issue of climate change.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Matawalle vowed to reveal the identities of those collaborating with terrorists to wreak havoc on Zamfara and other states.\nMatawalle lamented that terrorism in his state was not likely to end soon because of those behind it.\nThe governor stated, \u201cWith the kind of people we have in Zamfara State, I don\u2019t think this issue of banditry will end very soon because, already, some people are behind it.\nFirst of all, I initiated dialogue and reconciliation between the herders and farmers and during that dialogue, we spent more than nine months without any crisis in Zamfara State.\nBut I assure the people Zamfara State that they will see changes very soon and Mr. President is committed to bringing down this issue of insecurity to barest level.",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "American startup accelerator Y Combinator on Monday, January 10, 2021 announced that it has updated its standard deal for investing in startups, bumping the investment sum from $125,000 to $500,000\u2014still investing $125,000 for a 7% equity stake but now with an additional $375,000 on an uncapped SAFE with Most Favored Nation (MFN) terms.\n\nConsidering that in its 17 years of existence, this is the fourth time the accelerator\u2014which has funded 3,306 startups and 66 African startups\u2014is changing its standard deal, it\u2019s worth looking into what the change means.\n\nInvesting with SAFEs\n\nIntroduced by Y Combinator in late 2013, the SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) is an agreement that gives an investor a future right to own a part of a company (equity).\n\nFor an investor, investing with a SAFE option means putting money into a startup without a set valuation. That is, the investor is providing funding without knowing how much their investment is worth. This is beneficial to founders as they are not pressured early on to give their startups a valuation.\n\nTo protect the investors, SAFEs tend to include a valuation cap\u2014a maximum price at which an investor\u2019s contribution will be converted into equity at the next funding round. This gives investors the right to better terms in a subsequent financing round.\n\nIn the case of YC\u2019s new deal, the accelerator is investing $375,000 at an agreement that it\u2019ll own a future part of a startup. Uncapped means that there\u2019s no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 will be converted to equity. However, the MFN clause implies that instead of fixing a valuation cap, Y Combinator will automatically adopt the lowest cap (or other most favourable terms) issued by another investor the next time the startup raises money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so straightforward, YC is saying that whenever you raise your next round, whatever best terms you get, they\u2019ll match that as the terms for giving you the $375,000,\u201d Zacharias George, Managing Partner at Launch Africa Ventures told TechCabal.\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji, General Partner at Future Africa explained that this new deal makes things simpler as before the $125,000 investment issued by Y Combinator was made up of $25,000 for 6% and 1% for a $10m cap i.e $100,000.\n\n\u201cThe additional $375,000 is at no valuation, it\u2019s at the valuation you get when you\u2019re raising from other investors. Startups pick their next valuation, now there\u2019s no expectation that you make it $10m,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nNotably, the new deal retains Y Combinator\u2019s 4% pro-rata right\u2014a right that is given to an investor allowing them to maintain their initial level of ownership percentage during later financing rounds. This means Y Combinator still has the right to defend 4% of their stake in companies by investing at a follow-up round.\n\nMore money for growth but potential dilution\n\n\u201cNow startups that get into YC have more money to take on serious growth endeavours,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cOne of the issues I\u2019ve had with YC is that $125,000 couldn\u2019t help you in some cases achieve the kind of growth you need to be able to come up on demo day and put up an impressive pitch to get a higher valuation. But with $500,000, there\u2019s a lot you can achieve.\u201d\n\nThe positives are glaring and the announcement is a good move that\u2019s been welcomed by the African startup community. While Hannah Subayi, a board member of the African Business Angel Investors Network (ABAN) agrees with this, she pointed out a potential downside that has been echoed by other investors.\n\nThe MFN clause compels startups to raise at a higher valuation in the next round in order not to give up too much of their ownership to Y Combinator. For instance, if a company raises its next round at a $1 million valuation, the $375,000 investment means that YC gets to own 37.5% of the company!\n\nGeorge believes this isn\u2019t a one-sided affair as Y Combinator\u2019s potential stake could also be heavily diluted if the startup\u2019s next round is at a high valuation. \u201cImagine if the startup raises $10 million at a $100 million valuation, then YC\u2019s $375,000 will be worth just 0.375%,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud computing in Africa hasn\u2019t caught on as much as in the West. However, there are clear signs that the market is growing. The cloud computing industry in Africa and the Middle East is expected to be worth $31 billion by 2026 from $14 billion in 2021.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 12, 2022, Nigerian cloud-based HR and payroll management platform, SeamlessHR, raised $10 million to take its business across Africa with plans of setting up shop outside the continent.\n\nNew players such as Y Combinator-backed Bento and Workpay is also proof that cloud-based computing is on the rise in Africa, though most of them are in the HR and payroll management sector.\n\nOrda is another emerging player providing cloud-based services. While they are common with HR and payroll management, Orda offers its services to restaurants and food business owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is popping into the cloud-based scene with a $1.1 million pre-seed led by Lofty Inc Capital with participation from Microtraction, Norrsken Foundation, Magic Fund, Ire Aderinokun, and other angel investors.\n\nLaunched in April 2021, Orda was founded by Guy Futi (CEO), Adinlewa \u201cFikayo\u201d Akinwale (CTO), Mark Edomwande, Kunle Ogungbamila, and Namir El-Khouri. It is an electronic point of sale (ePOS) and restaurant management system that helps food business owners manage all their operations from one place.\n\nThe platform can take dine-in orders and orders from third-party apps such as Jumia Foods and social media apps. It manages these operations and gives customers relevant insights that help them make important business decisions to grow their businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to managing all restaurant operations, Orda also offers restaurants a lightweight website, mobile app, and inventory management system. It connects offline and online sales with inventory and provides data on supplies the restaurant is running out of.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, Futi said the idea for Orda came while the co-founders were looking to build restaurants that had the technology to support payments, transfers, and logistics.\n\nBut as they built, they realised the tech would be great for many restaurants, and they saw an opportunity.\n\n\u201cMany restaurants did not have the proper tools and software to run their business efficiently, and so thinking about it and going deeper into the problem, we decided to build Orda.\u201d\n\nThe platform essentially makes restaurant management easier, tracking everything that happens online and offline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the CTO, Akinwale, \u201cOrda was built after 18 months of a collaborative customer feedback loop. We listened to everything, from how African restaurants reconcile inventory, how customers pay, to how they handle logistics and more. We can confidently say that no one has done as much work as we have to build an end-to-end solution for our food business owners. We are excited to usher in much-needed digitisation to the sector.\u201d\n\nFuti, the former Managing Director at Jumia Foods, became familiar with restaurants in Nigeria and their challenges when it comes to management. This is perhaps why Orda added credit services to the platform, a service Futi says is growing rapidly.\n\nSince the startup became fully operational in June 2021, Futi said transactions and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) have been growing 15% week over week.\n\nThe startup\u2019s cloud-based system is currently available in Nigeria and Kenya. However, it plans to expand across Africa with the funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

Be it bookkeeping, logistics and eCommerce, to a total overhaul of their operations, 2021\u2019s numbers showed these startups meant business.\n\nThis year, the trend has not stopped. Float, a Ghanaian fintech has raised $17 million seed to help, you guessed it, power small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The round was a mix of $7 million equity led by Tiger Global and Jam Fund, and $10 million debt led by Carius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith slight tweaks to their approach, you\u2019ll find the likes of Brass, Kippa, Alerzo, Capiter, Sabi, and Payhippo playing in this space.\n\nMicro-lending platforms are waxing strong, but SME lending still remains a difficult nut to crack in Africa and really generous estimates in Nigeria put the gap at $28 billion. These SMEs account for the bulk of employment in nearly every continent and contribute a huge chunk to the GDP.\n\nThough there are potentially 44 million African SMEs to onboard, depending on the model these companies operate, this number could shrink when you narrow parameters to those who have registered businesses, own smartphones, and are computer literate.\n\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to those who acquire the right customers and find ways to make non-factors of the little hurdles I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Ghanaian fintech Float raises $17M seed to power cash flow for commerce in Africa\n\nAsaak\u2019s raise to support asset financing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Asaak\n\nCrazy things are happening in Morocco: On Friday, January 14, 2022, Ghita Mezzour, Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of Digital Transition and Administration Reform, announced the launch of the initiative \u201cMoroccoTech.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe not so crazy, but what\u2019s MoroccoTech? According to Mezzour, it is the national brand to promote the Moroccan digital sector. The idea is to position the country as a digital destination of choice internationally while creating a global dynamic that will benefit all Moroccan ecosystems in their digital transformation.\n\nIn 2021, Moroccan startups hit a record-high of $29 million in funding, perhaps an indication of the country\u2019s burgeoning tech ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was worse: In 2017, the Moroccan government sought a $50 million loan from the World Bank to close the funding gap for tech startups and going by this analysis, there was quite a lot wrong with the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a nascent private equity scene to lack of access to credit to restrictive regulations, Morocco\u2019s investment scene required some push. Personally, I\u2019m not sure most African countries were all that different.\n\nAt some point in the country\u2019s recent history, Moroccans could not enjoy the use of WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, or even YouTube.\n\nThe launch of MoroccoTech should hopefully see more Moroccan startup success stories. At least, much better than has been heard in the last few years.\n\nTL;DR: Morocco is looking for outside investments into its tech ecosystem.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHow Wiicreate is helping African startups improve brand visibility with branded merchandise.

          "title": "How Wiicreate is helping African startups improve brand visibility with branded merchandise",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone familiar with the Nigerian startup space, branded merchandise is often given out as part of the onboarding process or to reward loyal users. Before it became cool, Nigerians frequently used it during naming ceremonies, weddings, and even funerals.\n\nHowever, Oreoluwa Shonibare, Co-founder and CEO of Wiicreate, saw an opportunity to help startups improve their offline marketing campaigns using branded merchandise.\n\nAs a student at Bowen University studying Mass Communication, Public Relations, and Advertising, Shonibare became interested in graphic design. Starting with logos and fliers for students who had events on campus or small businesses looking to create awareness, he soon built a steady list of clients.\n\nDesigning flyers and logos was not all he did, though. He occasionally wrote poetry and soon started putting some of his art on T-shirts. He sold over 100 T-shirts and, in the process, learnt how merchandise could be used to communicate a brand\u2019s value proposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe power of Twitter\n\nAbout to graduate from the university, he saw a tweet from Donald Onwochei, who would later become his first partner. Onwochie was about to start a company and was looking for a co-founder with a graphic design background. Shonibare fit the bill, and he reached out to him.\n\nThis was in 2017, and for a start, they focused on T-shirts, spending time understanding the market and building a sustainable business model. Over the next two years, they designed T-shirts for students and over 30 Nigerian startups, including fintech startups, Cowrywise and PiggyVest.\n\nArmed with more knowledge, they decided to create a product \u2014 Merch box \u2014 in November 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the Wiicreate website\n\n\u201cWe basically help companies curate, ship, and brand merchandise ranging from T-shirts to water bottles, hoodies and thank you cards, just name it. Anything that can help you physically market your brand.\u201d\n\nWith Merch box, Wiicreate has been able to automate the entire process of sourcing, printing, and shipping merchandise for brands and individuals. On the website, users can choose from a wide range of merch options, put in their required quantity, and place their orders.\n\nAssuming the desired merch option is not available, users can place specific requests on the platform. They can choose from three product options \u2013 the starter, classic, and premium pack for \u20a615,000 ($27), \u20a625,000 ($45), and \u20a635,000 ($63), respectively.\n\n\u201cWe handle everything from the design to distribution basically. One thing that we are doing is that we are trying to automate the process and actually just change the way people see the ordering of merchandise.\u201d\n\nFor Shonibare, branded merchandise is capable of communicating a brand\u2019s personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of people say fintechs have very similar brand elements. Everybody uses blue, but when you see a Cowrywise merch, you know it\u2019s a Cowrywise merch. When you see a PiggyVest merch, you know it\u2019s a PiggyVest merch, and it is in the personality of these different brands even though they offer somewhat similar values.\u201d\n\nShonibare reveals that Wiicreate worked with over 100 startups across Africa in 2021, including Mono, Brass, and Thepeer, shipping to five countries and making $200,000 in revenue.\n\nA4 documents everywhere you go\n\nBranded merchandise is not all that Wiicreate does, as the company has recently launched Qwiik, an online printing service for A4 documents. With Qwiik, users can print and have their A4 documents delivered to any part of the country. Shonibare believes that this is the future of cybercafes.\n\n\u201cA4 documents are the most printed and probably the most essential print product in the world because you need A4 documents for basically anything you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch for AfriChange. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cSay you want to fill a form for visa application, you want to get a transcript, you want to send your transcript somewhere, you want to send your account statement; there are just so many use cases. If you want to send your documents to somebody, you don\u2019t have to go to the place. Qwiik is basically what the future of cybercafes looks like.\u201d\n\nThe cost of printing documents on Qwiik is similar to what you\u2019ll get at most cybercafes. Delivery options include same-day delivery, which costs \u20a61,200 ($2), next-day delivery for \u20a6800 ($1.5), and standard delivery (1-3 days) for \u20a6500 ($0.9).\n\nFor a one-page document that I wanted to be delivered to Osun State, the delivery fee was \u20a62,500 ($4) with an estimated delivery time of 1-3 days. In addition to printing documents online, Qwiik also provides PDF tools that let users edit, merge, or delete parts of their documents.\n\nOn challenges and building for the future\n\nBuilding a business usually comes with peculiar challenges, and Shonibare reveals that those that Wiicreate has faced are a bit different from what most Nigerian companies encounter. For starters, while merchandising is not a novel concept in the country, only a few companies have used tech in the way Wiicreate has done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch for Pandar. Source: Twitter\n\nThat means that the company has had to chart its course, discovering unique challenges and adapting to them without any manual. He, however, admits that they have been able to draw inspiration from foreign companies like SwagUp and Canva.\n\nBalancing growth and learning is another area where the startup has faced some challenges, with Shonibare revealing that growth has not always been at the same pace as learning.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019re growing faster than our learning, and some other times, we\u2019re learning faster than we\u2019re growing.\u201d\n\nWith a team strength of about 20, Shonibare reveals that the plan is to become the biggest merchandising company in Africa, working with more startups on the continent and growing revenue to millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe currently have seven unicorns in Africa, and there will be more. Just like we have been able to play our part with 95 startups, we hope to do that for 5,000 startups on the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Inflation surge unlikely to raise interest rate",
          "text": "The first increase in Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate in nine months is unlikely to lead to a hike in interest rates when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next week.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation accelerated for the first time in nine months last December, settling at 15.63 percent in December 2021, from 15.40 percent in the previous month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show.\n\nThe NBS in a Consumer Price Index report released on Monday attributed the marginal increase to higher demand during the yuletide, which pushed prices up.\n\n\u201cDespite the uptick in December inflation, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Monetary policy,\u201d Razia Khan, managing director, chief economist, Africa and the Middle East, Global Research, Standard Chartered Bank, said on Monday.\n\nThe removal of COVID-19 era monetary measures later in 2022 will be of greater relevance than any (less impactful) monetary policy rate changes, she said.\n\nThe CBN kept Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 11.5 percent and other indicators unchanged at the last meeting in November following a sustained gradual recovery of key macroeconomic indicators. This is as inflation moderated for the seventh successive month, buoyed by a deceleration in the core and food components of inflation.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, an economist and head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC Nigeria, said the acceleration in inflation rate must have been as a result of the high demand during the yuletide, which was not matched with increased production and other supplies. This is in addition to the insecurity challenges across the country that continues to impact negatively on transportation and food supply, major components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\n\u201cI do not expect the acceleration in inflation rate to impact on the MPC\u2019s rate decision at their next meeting given that the acceleration is likely to be transitory,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nPressure on Nigeria to increase interest rates is likely to come from global rising interest rates.\n\nFollowing the highest annual US inflation reading since 1982, more Federal Reserve officials are signalling support for a hike as soon as March.\n\n\u201cThis implies that the MPC may raise interest rates earlier than anticipated,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, said.\n\nRead also: Inflation may be driven beyond the projected 13% in 2022\n\nWhile the inflation rate was pushed upwards majorly by food inflation in December, there are several pressure points that will lead to higher inflation this year from taxes, removal of electricity subsidy, electricity tariff, and election spending, Ebo said. This will impact consumers\u2019 purchasing power and investors will be in search of investment with higher yields.\n\nThe headline inflation rate is expected to moderate to 15.35 percent, and 14.91 percent by December 2021 and February 2022, respectively, Godwin Emefiele, governor, CBN, said at November 2021 bankers\u2019 dinner.\n\nThe inflation outturn was mainly driven by food inflation, as festive induced spending drove the month-on-month (MoM) uptick to 2.20 percent (2x higher than November\u2019s MoM food inflation rate).\n\n\u201cWe link the food price pressures to the continued uptrend in Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) prices (+9.4% MoM), which might have translated to higher haulage costs for agricultural produces,\u201d analysts at CardinalStone Research, said in a report.\n\nThe report noted that core inflation increased marginally by 2bps to 13.87 percent YoY, reflecting continued price pressure on cooking gas and AGO. Notable price increases were seen on 93 percent of the core inflation sub-components, with alcoholic beverages, tobacco and kola (+55bps), and housing, water, electricity, and other gases and fuel (+55bps) leading the pack.\n\n\u201cAs highlighted in our 2022 economic outlook, we expect inflation to moderate for most of H1\u201922 due to the high base effect.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analysts said the base effect should begin to wane in May 2022, leaving legroom for price worries to become more evident on a MoM basis.\n\nNigeria inflation quickens for first time in nine months\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation has accelerated for the first time in nine months, settling at 15.63% in December 2021.\n\nThe headline inflation is about 0.2 percent higher than the 15.40 percent in November 2021, but a decline from 15.75 percent recorded about the same period in 2020.\n\nAn analysis of the trend indicates that headline consumer price decelerated to 18.12% in April 2021, 17.93% in May; 17.75% in June; 17.38% in July; 17.01% in August; 16.63% in September; 15.99% in October, and 15.40% in November.\n\nAccording to the NBS, food inflation settled at 17.37% in December as against 17.21% the previous month.\n\nCore inflation during the period also slightly went up to 13.87% as against 13.885%.\n\nUrban Inflation for December was 16.17%, while November recorded 15.92%. On the other hand, Rural Inflation was 15.11% and 14.89% in December and November 2021, respectively.\n\nOn state-by-state comparison, consumer prices accelerated the most in Ebonyi State with 18.71%, while Kwara State recorded the slowest with 12.32%.\n\nOn the other hand, Food Inflation was highest in Kogi State with 22.82%, while Edo State was the lowest with 13.24%.\n\n\u201cIf you check the trend, you will discover the increases in the month of December, and that is because every Nigerian saves money for December purchases. So that has the tendency of increasing the prices of a lot of commodities, and that affected the numbers that are collected from the field.\n\n\u201cThat also explained why we could not maintain a trajectory of consistent decline in the numbers,\u201d the new statistician general, Simon Harry, said, speaking on the CPI report.\n\nOn the inflation projections for 2022, Harry stated, \u201cAgain, I will say that if you go through the trend you will discover that after the rise in December, the demand of goods in January begins to go down and as demand goes down, you discover that the price of goods begin to go down.\n\n\u201cAnd so that also has the tendency to affect the numbers collected from the field. So, we may return to a gradual decline from the month of January, which certainly will be below the 15.63 percent we are recording.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to mention a specific figure but I can assure you that as demand wanes, the inflation rate will be brought down.\u201d",
          "summary": "The first increase in Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate in nine months is unlikely to lead to a hike in interest rates when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next week.\n\u201cI do not expect the acceleration in inflation rate to impact on the MPC\u2019s rate decision at their next meeting given that the acceleration is likely to be transitory,\u201d Oyedele said.\nThe inflation outturn was mainly driven by food inflation, as festive induced spending drove the month-on-month (MoM) uptick to 2.20 percent (2x higher than November\u2019s MoM food inflation rate).\nAccording to the NBS, food inflation settled at 17.37% in December as against 17.21% the previous month.\nOn the other hand, Food Inflation was highest in Kogi State with 22.82%, while Edo State was the lowest with 13.24%.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s plan to take more loans from China to fund critical infrastructure might come to a halt on the back of the country\u2019s intent to cut lending to African countries as a result of the continent\u2019s rising debt profile.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, while speaking with the triennial Forum of China-Africa Cooperation, held in Senegal last year November, indicated that China, over the next three years, would slash the headline amount of money it supplies to Africa by a third (1/3) to $40 billion with more emphasis on SMEs, green projects and private investment flows rather than large infrastructure, which was the former norm.\n\nThis came barely five-month President Muhammadu Buhari said it would continue to collaborate with the Chinese government in the area of provision of critical infrastructure June last year.\n\nFemi Adesina, special adviser to the president on media and publicity, stated this when he hosted Cui Jianchun, Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, in his office at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\u201cNigeria has high respect for China and what China is helping Nigeria to achieve, particularly in the area of infrastructure.\n\n\u201dPresident Buhari came at a time of severe infrastructure deficit in the country and resolved to make a difference and he is making that difference with the assistance of China. Nigeria appreciates China a lot for these and will continue to collaborate with it,\u201d he said then.\n\nChina is Nigeria\u2019s biggest bilateral creditor, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, stated, saying, \u201cA significant number of the country\u2019s big-ticket infrastructure projects are financed by China.\n\nRead also: Stanbic IBTC introduces Smart Loan to support customers\n\n\u201cAnd now that China is saying they want to cut down on these lending, it might affect Nigeria a bit in terms of getting cheap funds for infrastructure projects because the money they are getting from China is concessionary funds (long-term maturity at low-interest rates).\u201d\n\nLast year, Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, said they plan to take more loans from China in a bid to extend rail services to more states in the country.\n\n\u201cWe raised funds from China to do the Lagos-Ibadan. Currently, we are doing Kaduna-Abuja from the budget, but we are yet to get the loan. We are still negotiating with China and we hope that before March next year, we should be able to get the loan so that we can continue,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nFrom almost nothing, Chinese banks today make up about one-fifth of the total lending to Africa, concentrated in a few strategic/resource-rich countries, some of which include Nigeria, Angola, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, and Uganda.\n\nAccording to reports from the Debt Management Office (DMO), Nigeria\u2019s bilateral loans stand at $4.40 billion as of September 31, 2021. Out of that figure, China accounts for the largest share of 81 percent followed by France (11.9%), Germany (3.9%), Japan (1.6%), and India (0.7%)\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be a good one for Africa because it is another tactic of course. The kind of planning that needs to go into transiting to green energy is massive. A lot of African countries are not well planned for that now,\u201d Damilare Asimiyu, a senior analyst at Afrinvest Securities Limited, said.\n\nHe said in terms of our growth dynamics, it was not going to be favourable for us because we don\u2019t have the capacity to make that transition now.\n\nHaving dived head-deep into one of the world\u2019s poorest continents, Chinese lenders have grown more cautious as some nations have reached the limit of their borrowing capacity and the prospect of default looms large.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) lists more than 20 African countries as being in, or at high risk of debt distress.\n\nChinese banks have learned many lessons over two decades of lending to African governments. In the 2000s, they experimented with financing infrastructure in resource-rich countries, such as Angola and the Republic of Congo, by securing loans against oil or mineral shipments or future-derived revenues.\n\nRising African debt and the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic may force China\u2019s banks to adjust their lending practices yet again.\n\nBankers and lawyers however caution that a systemic crisis could overwhelm Chinese banks\u2019 attempts to protect their interests through escrow accounts and exemption from global debt restructuring deals.\n\nIt is going to be a major setback in infrastructure development in Nigeria, Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, said.\n\n\u201cWe depend significantly on them (China) to execute a significant number of our projects, especially now that we want to execute our National Development Plan,\u201d Ebo pointed out.\n\n\u201cIt is high time we began to look to other countries for loans,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding fuel to the flames, events from China\u2019s debt repayment debacle with Uganda last year served as a stimulant that accelerated the decision by the Chinese government to eventually cut back on lending to Africa.\n\nThe crux of the matter was centered on a contract signed six years earlier between the Ugandan government and China Eximbank; one which some Ugandan lawmakers, officials and lawyers said undermined national sovereignty.\n\nA Ugandan report last year even suggested that Beijing could seize Entebbe Airport (the country\u2019s main international gateway), a claim that echoed accusations of Chinese \u201cdebt traps\u201d and one forcefully denied by both governments.\n\nIn response, China\u2019s two main policy banks \u2013 China Eximbank and China Development Bank \u2013 thus adopted increasingly hard-line lending terms. The conditions have, however, proved difficult as pandemic-related economic hardship puts a strain on more indebted African countries.\n\nWhile some analysts draw a parallel with western financial institutions, including IMF and World Bank, which lent generously to African governments in the post-independence period only to impose harsh structural adjustment programmes on them from the 1980s after governments struggled to repay, others are of the opinion that some of the concerns over the contract clauses are overblown.\n\nIn both cases, however, all project revenues are currently channelled into China\u2019s debt repayment reserve account; in effect, giving Chinese lenders first dibs on revenue of any African country, if the country at any point becomes distressed, Nigeria inclusive.",

          "title": "AFCFTA drags one year after \u2026as Nigeria, others fail to pull weight",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nNigeria and the 53 other African nations that signed up for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) may have to wait much more longer for the benefits of the treaty, as poor infrastructure, red-tapism, entrenched protectionism, as well as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic continued to dog the program.\n\nAfter several months of delay, African countries officially began trading under a new continent-wide free trade area on January 1, 2020. It promoters aim to bring together 1.3 billion people in a $3.4 trillion economic bloc that will be the largest free trade area since the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nApart from allowing the continent to develop its own value chains, backers had projected that trading between African neighbours would be boosted by about 60% by 2022.\n\nAccording to a research conducted by the African Development Bank (AfDB), only 16% of international trade by African countries takes place between African countries.\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) in it\u2019s own report, said African nations currently trade more internationally than with one another. The forum puts the trade volume between the continent and Asia at 59 per cent and 68 per cent for Europe.\n\nHowever, one year into the official takeoff of the ambitious programme, it has failed to live up to expectations owing to several obstacles on it\u2019s part, leading experts to advise participating countries to quickly remove the obstacles if AfCFTA is to reach its full potential.\n\nFindings by Business Hallmark show that two of the major challenges facing the program is the lack of political will to implement the deal and the protectionist stance of many African governments and interest groups who fear losing out to more competitive neighbours.\n\nFor instance, out of the 54 African countries that have signed the AfCFTA deal, only four have deposited their instruments of ratification at the AU depositary, with 50 others, including Nigeria yet to do so.\n\nOne of such countries where AfCFTA has recorded a false start is Nigeria. BH reliably gathered that apart from some challenges preventing the program from taking off in the country, such as poor infrastructure, consensus on trade protocols and strategy among stakeholders and red-tapism, it is also bugged down by the scepticism of the pan-African project on the part of some influential members in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSources in government and the private sector confided in our correspondent that the operational phase is yet to commence in the country.\n\nAccording to one of the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the major challenge preventing the takeoff of the project in the country is the provision in the treaty establishing AfCFTA that there should be 90 per cent tariff liberalisation on goods originating from the continent and the insistence by the Federal Government that it wants at least 180 products produced in Nigeria protected.\n\nWhile 131 products are on the FG\u2019s import prohibition list, the remaining products on the exclusive list were picked based on national priorities, trade volume, food security and competitive advantage, the source stated.\n\nMeanwhile, only seven per cent of sensitive products and three per cent of exclusive products have already been negotiated, leaving over 4,300 tariff lines under the liberalised list.\n\nThe demands, it was further gathered, had been submitted by Nigeria\u2019s trade delegation to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for negotiation.\n\nBased on the AfCFTA treaty, some sensitive and exclusive products have to be liberalised within the 10-year period agreed in the deal.\n\nAnother obstacle on the path of the successful take off of AfCFTA is the snail speed in the negotiation of the Rules of Origin (RoO).\n\nThe RoO, it was learnt, are at about 87.65 per cent completed with outstanding work of about 10 per cent on textiles and two per cent relating to automobiles.\n\nIt was also learnt that while the Federal Government had received offers from 41 countries, the offers are yet to be verified.\n\nAlso, Phase 2 negotiations on investment, intellectual property and competition are at early stages while talks on women and youth in trade and digital trade are yet to start.\n\nApart from the challenges of trade nationalism and red-tapism, another obstacle that worked against the smooth kickoff of AfCFTA, is the disruption of international trade by by the Covid19 pandemic.\n\nThe restrictions imposed by many countries in their desperate efforts to contain the spread of the virus disrupted global supply chains, with manufacturers unable to get raw materials and access to markets for their goods.\n\nReacting to the slow implementation of AfCFTA, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), advised the Federal Government to continue to liaise with the private sector in making it operational.\n\n\u201cNow that we have signed, ratified and deposited the instrument of ratification at the repository, the National Action Committee (NAC) should be effectively supported to continue to vigorously engage the private sector and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to accelerate the putting in place of all structures required for beneficial trade.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, we implore government to urgently embark on establishing the Designated Competent Authority that will superintend the administration of Rules of Origin and Commission the automation of the Certificate of Origin and export and import documentation processes for AfCFTA transactions,\u201d the MAN boss, Mansur Ahmed advised.\n\nIn his own response, the Secretary-General of AfCFTA Secretariat, Mr. Wamkele Mene, beseeched Africans to be patient, explaining that the target of the agreement is to achieve zero duty on 97 per cent of all products traded in the continent by 2035.\n\n\u201cI think Africans should be patient and understand that we are in the initial stages of significance to go together under a single set of rules.\n\n\u201cWe will learn from the experience of the European Union (EU) that it took 72 years to get to this point of market interventions that it enjoys today.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is not an easy task, it is time-consuming, and it requires patience to see results in years to come.\n\n\u201cI am not worried about the slowness because typically, negotiations and implementation of trade agreements is not something that happens overnight,\u201d Mene noted.\n\nA researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Teniola Tayo, said the decision to launch trade on 1 January 2021, highlighted the urgency to negotiations among participating countries.\n\nAccording to her, the slow takeoff of the project did not come as a surprise to her as the politics behind tariff agreements in individual countries could be difficult, as witnessed in Nigeria.\n\nCorroborating Tayo, the Head of African Futures and Innovation at the ISS, Jakkie Cilliers, said the slow start recorded by the project did not in any way cast doubt on the viability of AfCFTA, insisting that the launch was just a symbolic gesture while negotiation go on behind the scenes.\n\n\u2018The road to AfCFTA is a long one and the 1 January 2021 trading start date is generally seen for what it was, a symbolic gesture.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be many more delays and false starts. I think the question is rather how AfCFTA will work if sub-regional arrangements have not,\u201d the Head of African Futures and Innovation at ISS stated.\n\nLike in Nigeria, the AfCFTA project has failed to live up to expectations in many African countries. From Ghana, to Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, Togo, Morocco and many others, the story is the same.\n\nDisturbed by the development, Ghana\u2019s International Trade and Finance conference (GITFiC), recently lamented the failure of most African countries to fully develop a comprehensive National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy.\n\nWhile conceding that countries may have existing trade policies and developed guidelines, GITFiC insists that was not enough to maximise the full benefits of AfCFTA.\n\nA consultant at ISS, Peter Fabricius, said: \u201cComplex trade negotiations no doubt take time. But by firing the starting gun almost a year ago when no runners were out of the starting blocks, African leaders have created confusion, especially among traders.\n\n\u201cMaybe the early start date was needed to drive negotiations. But to sustain momentum, the AfCFTA secretariat and participating states should do a better job of keeping traders in the loop about why implementation is taking so long\u201d, said Fabricius.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Massive withdrawal hits PFA\u2019s, unemployment soars",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nThe unemployment crisis ravaging the nation is taking a toll on the pension industry as many out of work Nigerians below the statutory retirement age of 50 years are prematurely drawing out their retirement benefits, BusinessHallmark findings can reveal.\n\nThe crisis, findings revealed, has negatively impacted on pension funds, especially the reduction in members\u2019 contributions, early withdrawals, as well as a drastic reduction in investments assets by the funds\u2019 administrators.\n\nSome financial experts who spoke on the development blamed the hit on the PFAs on rising cases of unemployment which rose to 33 percent, its highest in 13 years in 2021. The rate is also the world\u2019s second-highestin2020.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate hit a new record high of 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2020 from 27.1 recorded in the second quarter (Q2) 2020.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s Q4 unemployment report released in March 2021 indicates that a total of 23.18 million persons either did nothing or worked for less than 20 hours a week, making them unemployed during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nAlso, while the underemployment rate decreased from 28.6 per cent to 22.8 per cent during the period under review, a combination of both the unemployment and underemployment rate for the reference period was 56.1 per cent.\n\nThough the NBS is yet to release the figure for 2021, the newly appointed Economic Adviser to the President, Dr. Doyin Salami, had in September 2021 projected that Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate will climb to 40 percent by the end of 2021.\n\nSalami, who was the chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) before his new appointment, blamed rising unemployment on the low capacity of the manufacturing sector.\n\nCiting the CBN\u2019s July 2021 Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index report, the economist said that the sectors\u2019 employment indices at 46.5 remain constrained below the 50 points mark. A figure below 50 indicates contraction in employment levels.\n\nAs the unemployment figure soars, more Nigerians are falling back on their savings in the PFAs for survival, despite being below 50 years of age. They were able to access the funds because of a provision in the Pension Reform Act (PRA) 2014 which allows a Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holder who is less than 50 years of age and has not been in any form of paid/gainful employment for a minimum period of four months after formal exit from employment to apply for 25percent of the balance in his/her RSA in line with the Regulations for the Administration of Retirement and Terminal Benefits.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Pension Industry report compiled by a leading credit rating agency and provider of industry research and knowledge in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa, Agusto & Co., out of the N699billion annual average pension contribution recorded in the last five years (2016-2021), N341billion (48.78%) have been withdrawn.\n\nThe report further revealed that while pension contributions in the period under review amounted to a net annual value of N347billion, it only accounted for 26.6% of the industry\u2019s asset under management (AuM). On the other hand, the remaining 73.4 percent of average growth came from returns on investments.\n\n\u201cThe growth in the industry\u2019s managed assets has been largely driven by investment returns and additional contributions, to a lesser extent,\u201dthe rating agency confirmed in the report.\n\nBH checks revealed that in the first six months of 2021 (January to June), disengaged workers in both the private and government sectors withdrew N9.45billion from their retirement savings account.\n\nThe revelation was made know by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) in its report titled: \u2018Withdrawal due to temporary loss of employment\u2019 released in October 2021.\n\nAccording to the pension regulator, the affected workers contacted their PFAs after searching unsuccessfully for work four months after their sacking or resignation.\n\nA breakdown of the report indicates that while 1,645 of the sacked workers worked for the government 16,880 were engaged by private firms.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of 2021 (January to March), the commission granted approval for the payment of N5.02 billion to 10,619 RSA holders under the age of 50 years, who were disengaged from work and unable to secure jobs within four months.\n\n\u201cWhile in the second quarter of the year, \u201cThe commission approved the payment of N4.43bn to 7,906 RSA holders under the age of 50 years, who were disengaged from work and unable to secure jobs within four months,\u201d the report stated.\n\nA source in PenCom who did not want her name in print because she did not have the permission to speak, told BH that as ofJune 2021, the sum of N152billion had been withdrawn by 324,141 pension contributors affected workers from their retirement savings accounts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Director General of PenCom, AishaDahir-Umar, while confirming that Covid-19 Pandemic, which disrupted the entire global order impacted negatively on the pension industry, has allayed fears of possible run on the scheme, saying that the mass withdrawals by disengaged workers was moderate when compared with the total pension assets.\n\n\u201cThe Covid-19 Pandemic, which created disruptions in the entire global order has impacted negatively on most sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cHowever, it had a somewhat moderate impact on the Nigerian pension industry. Specifically, the impact of withdrawals from RSAs due to temporary loss of employment on the total pension fund assets is moderate when compared with the total pension assets, which stood at N12.78 trillion as at 31 July, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe actual amount paid out to RSA holders as 25 percent of RSA balances due to temporary loss of job was N29.90 billion, from March, 2020 when the COVID restrictions were imposed to date.\n\n\u201cThe provision for this type of withdrawal from RSA is clearly a proactive step enshrined in the Pension Reform Act 2014 to cushion the impact of job losses for an employee provided that he/she does not secure another employment within a period of four months\u201d, the PenCom boss explained.\n\nWorldBank\u2019s lead economist for Nigeria, Marco Hernandez, warned that the situation could worsen as it is unlikely for an unemployed person who is struggling to get by and living on less than $2aday to have the capacity to save for his or her retirement.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s population is expected to grow by as much as 35million in the next decade, and unless the pace of growth and job creation accelerates, the country will account for a quarter of all people living in extreme poverty worldwide,\u201d Hernandez warned.",

          "text": "A former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Nditimi Alaibe, has reconciled with the Bayelsa State governor, Senator Douye Diri, after two years of soured relationship following the controversial governorship primaries of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the State about two years ago.\n\nGovernor Diri had won the governorship primary with 561 votes while his main rival, Alaibe scored 365 votes.\n\nAlaibe, however, rejected the outcome of the primaries and pursued his case up to the Supreme Court where he also lost out.\n\nAlaibe, however, extended an olive branch to Governo Diri after exhausting his legal options but his peace moves were rejected by Governor Diri, who described such peace offering as belated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey are both from the same Kolokuma/Opokuma local government area and have been political associates for over 20 years.\n\nHowever, LEADERSHIP gathered that the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, played a major role in reconciling the duo. Wike was reported to have prevailed on Governor Diri, during his last week visit to Yenagoa, to end the cold feud with Alaibe.\n\nA PDP source told LEADERSHIP that Diri accepted Wike\u2019s reconciliatory offer but said all is left for Alaibe to make such peace move.\n\nIt was clear that during the closed-door meeting between the two governors at the Bayelsa Government House, the reconciliation matter was discussed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike immediately nominated the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Austin Okpara, and a former Transport Minister, Abiye Sekibo, to meet with Alaibe and reconcile the duo.\n\n\u201cOkpara and Sekibo met with Alaibe and discussed the issue. They told Alaibe that the reconciliation is important for Bayelsa and national PDP politics. That the State is losing the clout and knowledge of politics associated with a politician like Timi Alaibe. Many other things were said by Timi Alaibe but it is not for print,\u201d the source said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Alaibe, who on Sunday evening visited Governor Diri at his residence in the Bayelsa Government House in open acceptance of the reconciliation effort initiated by Governor Wike and peace in the state, confirmed the development in a statement issued few hours later, insisting that the reconciliation was achieved after repeated interventions by mutual friends, business partners and political associates.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI finally considered it necessary to put an end to the ugly past, drop political differences and re-establish age-old friendship with my brother and State Governor, Douye Diri. That happened on Sunday January 16. Let me state here that Governor Diri and I have come a long way. We have not only been political partners, there is a deep sense of brotherhood in our relationship. Somehow, in 2019, political differences thrust a sharp knife into that bond; and as the late Chinua Achebe would say, things fell apart and the centre could no longer hold.\n\n\u201cBut then, blood is thicker than water. We both knew that what happened was temporal. Our mutual friends decided to wade in; especially those who knew what happened and believed that Governor Diri could not be held directly responsible. He only had favour thrusted upon him. I must admit that out of a deep sense of humility and friendship, Governor Diri had, at several times, shortly after taking office, personally reached out to me. I chose to remain silent as I reviewed the situation. But all that is now history.\n\n\u201cTime has healed the wounds and I have chosen to do the right thing. There is no doubt that the reconciliation will surprise a lot of people; particularly some political jobbers who profited from our temporary silence. What has happened might also be misinterpreted and given various coloration by different people. But the truth is that I have chosen to listen to the voice of wisdom and re-establish a cherished relationship; which politics tried to destroy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTo demonstrate the sincerity of my intentions and reciprocate the same humility, which Governor Diri had displayed previously, I refused to meet him on a neutral ground. Instead, in company of close friends, I went to the governor\u2019s official residence in Yenogoa and I was warmly welcomed by him and his team. I am thoroughly impressed by the sincerity displayed of my governor. So, the past is behind us. Politics has taken the backstage. Friendship and the collective interest of Bayelsa people are in the centre-stage now. We are back to work together in love and unity. Join us,\u201d Alaibe stated.\n\nIn his response, the Bayelsa State governor also confirmed the reconciliation and end to the cold war between him and Alaibe, saying: \u201cA great day indeed when I received my brother, the man we call \u201cPrincipal\u201d, Chief Timi Alaibe, proud son of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\n\n\u201cWe have been in this political journey together for over 20 years and I am glad to reunite with him for the love and development of our dear State of Bayelsa. It\u2019s indeed a new dawn! A whole new chapter has been opened as we all reflected on the past. Together, we can make that difference for our people.\u201d",

Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu should be given the choice of first refusal. More than any other person, he has sacrificed more for this democracy, for the APC.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to tone down critical assessments of your future leaders, but redirect you to see the bigger picture. We are not here to prepare for the Olympics, but an institution that relies on the superiority of ideas to thrive. Asiwaju\u2019s credentials aren\u2019t only appealing; they are proof of the qualities this country needs to redeem its vast potentials and possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe are here to testify to this power of ideas\u2014one that overturned the fortunes of Lagos state and sustained its supremacy as the largest economy in Sub-Saharan Africa and kept the opposition alive when it was more profitable to sell out.\n\n\u201cThose who seek to make us go low hope to present the presidency as a brick-laying exercise. But that\u2019s the work of a machine created by an idea, and who else to guide us towards manufacturing the best ideas to redeem this country?\n\n\u201cThe conversations we are prepared for aren\u2019t pedestrian obsessions with the mundane, but comparisons of ideas and track records of service to the nation.\n\n\u201cAt the top of our expectations from Nigeria\u2019s next president should be mastery of the dynamics of the modern economy, testified leadership skills and competence, and, very significantly, sensitivity to the complexities of Nigerian sociology.\u201d\n\nEx-SGF Babachir\n\nFor the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Pastor Babachir Lawal, the ruling APC has derailed from the founding fathers\u2019 ideal of a party and that the preferred way to select the next presidential candidate of the party should be through direct primaries.\n\nLawal said: \u201cWe are neither offended nor threatened by whichever method the party chooses to adapt for the emergence of its presidential candidate. But of course, being democrats, we prefer a method that involves all the card carrying members of the party in this choosing process.\n\n\u201cThe incapacity of the party to even harmonise and synergize policy direction of the federal government with that of States it controls, especially in key critical areas around which the campaigns were ran, speaks volumes about its incompetence.\n\n\u201cCompounding these problems in the last one year is the apparent hijacking of the party by a self-serving cabal who, driven by personal ambitions, have failed to organise even simple conflict-free Ward, Local Government, and State Congresses not to talk of a National Convention. As we speak, there are only a handful of states in the country that do not have parallel state executives.\n\n\u201cThis is the current state of our party and it is in this environment that we gathered here must operate to deliver Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the party\u2019s flag bearer at the 2023 presidential election. And this we will do be it through consensus, indirect or direct party primaries by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nEx-Rep Jibrin\n\nAlso speaking, Director General SGMC Abdulmumin Jibrin said 2023 is about the future of Nigeria and the best person to lead the country is Asiwaju Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t take chances. We wanted the best hand. Yes, within the APC we have said repeatedly, we have very good hands. We have very good and competent and qualified people that can be President but we have someone that has an edge and beyond having an edge, we want someone that combines the competence, the qualification and the capacity, to win the election. And who has that the whole of that all combined? Asiwaju,\u201d Jibrin said.\n\nN/East support group\n\nIn a related development, the Tinubu Progressive Organisation has inaugurated its patrons and executives in the North-east region with a commitment to work for his victory in the forthcoming party primary and 2023 presidential election in general.\n\nAt the inauguration in Bauchi Monday, the North-east Coordinator of the group, Halilu Domdaz said Tinubu has all the requisite experience to bring the needed change through appropriate and exemplary leadership if given the mandate to lead the country.\n\nHe noted that \u201cTinubu\u2019s tenure as governor of Lagos state landed positive changes in the state and his transparency, focused and result oriented Leadership made him to became a reference point in public discourse.\u201d\n\nDomdaz said: \u201cFellow compatriots, we have no better than time than now, to vindicate our national leader \u201ca kingmaker can also be a king\u201d. The truth remains that unless power is given to a person like Bola Ahmed Tinubu to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, then this great country of ours will not move forward.\n\n\u201cWe are all living witnesses of how Bola Tinubu and other stakeholders in our blessed party effectively strategized, organized, mobilized and galvanized support for President Muhammadu Buhari, culminating in his overwhelmed victory at the 2015 and 2019 presidential polls.\u201d\n\nDescribing the former lawmaker as one to take Nigeria out of the woods and consolidate on Buhari\u2019s achievements, the Tinubu campaigner called on Nigerians to give his their support.\n\nIn his message, the National Coordinator, Tinubu Progressive Organisation, Engineer Lawal Bello congratulated the new executives of the group in the North-east and challenged them to work assiduously in order to assist in achieving the set objectives.\n\nEngineer Bello said the Tinubu progressive organisation would soon unveil its nationwide campaign plans to seek for the support and cooperation of Nigerians for Tinubu as their preferred choice.",
          "summary": "The immediate past governor of Borno state and serving federal lawmaker, Senator Kashim Shettima, has told those criticising the health condition of former Lagos state governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, that the latter is not preparing for an Olympic game but Nigeria presidency.!!\nAsiwaju Tinubu had made his intention known publicly to contest 2023 presidential election when he met President Muhammadu Buhari recently.\nThe former Lagos state governor said occupying the nation\u2019s number one seat had been his lifelong ambition.\nAbout 2,500 Tinubu support groups from across the country were represented by delegates at the conference.\nAsiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu should be given the choice of first refusal.",

          "text": "With barely one year to the 2023 general elections, Nigerians have continued to express worry over the continued delay in the signing of the Electoral Act 2010 Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nMore than any other thing, the delay has kept the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) waiting and guessing on how best to plan ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in December last year, refused assent to the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment ) Bill 2021 passed by both Chambers of the National Assembly on account of mandatory provision of direct primaries for political parties in choice of candidates for general election as contained in section 87(2) of the rejected bill .\n\nIn the letter of refusal of assent dated December 13, 2021, the president said the provision was undemocratic and also a serious infraction on Constitution of the various political parties which offers various options of direct, indirect and consensus arrangement for such elections.\n\nCSOs\n\nReacting to the delay in a joint position Monday, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) said the Bill reflects the wishes of Nigerians and key electoral stakeholders for a legal framework that promotes the use of technology and other innovations to stem electoral manipulation, strengthen INEC\u2019s financial independence, and empowers the Commission to reject falsified election results.\n\nBesides, they said further delay to conclude work on amendment process is also inimical to the preparations for Ekiti and Osun off-cycle governorship elections and the 2023 general elections.\n\nThey spoke at a joint press conference Monday in Abuja on the need for the National Assembly to act on the Bill with dispatch upon resumption from recess.\n\nThe CSOs comprised Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS), Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF) and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nOther CSOs in attendance include the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organizations (NNNGO) and Inclusive Friends Association (IFA).\n\nSpeaking at the event, Board member, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwangwu, said a new legal framework is central to the integrity of 2023 General elections, future elections and the advancement of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nNwangwu emphasised the imperative of a speedy enactment of the Bill to strengthen the Electoral legal framework.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is required to facilitate early preparations for the 2023 general elections and to eschew legal uncertainties that make the electoral process susceptible to manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe activist said \u201cthe opportunity to test the operability of the new legislation and functionality of the new innovations will be lost if the amendment process is not concluded expeditiously.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, with only 398 days to the 2023 general election, it is crucial for the National Assembly and President to conclude the electoral amendment process by 31 January 2022.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should remove the contentious clause of direct primaries, resolve all the identified drafting errors and cross-referencing gaps and re-transmit the bill to the President for assent within a week of resumption,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Executive Director International Press Centre (IPC) Lanre Arogundade said as the nation awaits the resumption of the National Assembly Tuesday 18 January 2022, Nigerians expect that work on the Electoral Amendment Bill would be the priority issue on the order paper.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the National Assembly should therefore conclude this process as any further delay will undermine public confidence in the reform process.\n\n\u201cThe Senate and House of Representatives should upon resumption on Tuesday, 18 January, 2022, take legislative action at its first sitting to conclude the process and re-transmit the Bill to President Buhari by Friday, January 21, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should ensure proper scrutiny of the bill to resolve all drafting errors and cross-referencing gaps before re-transmitting the bill for Presidential Assent.\n\n\u201cCivil society groups, media, and development partners sustain the effort to safeguard the Electoral Bill from policy capture, manipulation, and subversion of the people\u2019s will,\u201d Arogundade further said.\n\nSAN rules out fear\n\nWhile commenting on the development in an exclusive interview with Blueprint, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ahmed Raji, said there should be no cause for alarm over the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not nursing any fear. Well, if there is no amendment, then we can use the old law, I think there is no problem. Have we not been having bye elections before now? So what is the matter this time?\n\n\u201cI think they will resolve it. I also don\u2019t think vetoing Mr President is the best thing to do.\n\n\u201cThey said they want direct primary, so what?\u201d\n\nAPC\n\nIn a reaction, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) expressed support for the president on the issue, saying it expects same of its lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nNational Secretary APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Senator John James Akpanudoedehe stated this Monday in a chat with Blueprint.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy convention, I am not supposed to make comments about the Senate openly because I am a former Senator. You do not expect me to start castigating anyone when we have a channel of communication.\n\n\u201cTwo, the party is expected to stand behind the President and we expect all our members, including lawmakers, to do that. That is what is meant by party supremacy.\u201d\n\nPDP govs\n\nIn a position at the end of their meeting in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Monday charged the National Assembly to delete areas of complaints in Electoral Act Amendment Bill, noting that an early concluded electoral act is vital to credible elections.\n\nAs contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by 11 of the PDP governors, the meeting once again reviewed the state of the states and the state of the nation.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads: \u201cThe PDP Governors congratulated the entire PDP family for conducting a smooth and credible National Convention that led to the emergence of the highly acclaimed Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led National Executive Committee and commended the new PDP NWC for hitting the ground running with respect to repositioning the PDP into a credible vehicle for rescuing and rebuilding Nigeria which has been battered by bad economy, insecurity, unemployment and other social ills by the incompetent and inept APC Administration.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors requested the National Assembly to quickly conclude deliberations on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill either by overriding Mr. President\u2019s veto or deleting areas of complaints.\n\n\u201cThe meeting advised that the option of sustaining Mr. President\u2019s veto would lead to a quicker resolution and would deny Mr. President the opportunity to once again truncate a reformed Electoral jurisprudence for Nigeria. An early concluded Electoral Act is vital for credible elections.\n\n\u201cThe meeting lamented the continued state of insecurity in the country, the persistent and ceaseless flow of Nigerians\u2019 blood on a daily basis in many parts of Nigeria, the near collapse of the security situation in Nigeria. The strategy to confront terrorists, kidnappers, bandits and other criminals is still a major problem of the APC administration.\u201d\n\nNASS\n\nBut speaking ahead of Senate resumption of plenary Tuesday, Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi (APC Kebbi North) declared Monday that the rejected clause 87 of the Electoral Bill by President Buhari would be reviewed in line with opinions of constituents.\n\nFielding questions from journalists in his office on what would be the next line of action by the Senate on the contentious provision, the Senate Leader said aggregate opinions of constituents already gathered by each of the senator would determine the decision of the Senate.\n\n\u201cSenators have consulted with their constituents and the outcome of their discussions will be reflected during debate on the floor of the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker said the Senate would also interact with the House of Representatives for common position on the clause.\n\n\u201cSince no single chamber can take decision on such an issue , as declared by the President of the Senate , Ahmad Lawan , last year , both chambers shall collaborate for harmonisation of position on the contentious clause.\n\n\u201cWhatever position that would be taken on the controversial electoral bill would be in line with the provision of the 1999 Constitution as amended\u201d, he stressed.\n\nWhen probed further, he said he cannot predict what the final decision of lawmakers would be on the electoral bill.\n\nAside Electoral Bill, the leader added that report on Constitution review exercise carried out separately by Ad-hoc Committees set up to that effect by both chambers, would also be considered in meeting up with time for such legislation.\n\nOn security challenges facing the country, Senate Leader Yahaya commended Buhari for approving the declaration of bandits as terrorists, which according to him, vindicated the Senate\u2019 s resolution to that effect November last year.\n\nINEC\n\nMeanwhile, the INEC has expressed its desire to have the new Electoral Act 2021 Amendment Bill signed into law at the earliest possible time.\n\nHowever, the commission said, in event the Bill was not signed, it would have to rely on the extant laws of the land- The Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to conduct the elections.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, stated this Monday in a chat with Blueprint.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the area(s) of disagreement between the Presidency and the National Assembly on the Bill would be resolved quickly.\n\n\u201cIt is the Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s (INEC) desire that the new Electoral Act Amendment Bill is signed into Law at the earliest possible time.\n\n\u201cThis will give the commission enough time to plan for the 2023 General Election as well as other off cycle elections. It will also enable the commission to update its regulations and guidelines.\n\n\u201cThere are many good things in the new Bill that would, without doubt, assist the commission to further improve the conduct of election and the electoral system.\n\n\u201cWe do hope that the area (s) of disagreement between the Presidency and the National Assembly over the Bill will be resolved quickly.\n\n\u201cHowever, if eventually, the bill is not signed, the implication is that the Commission would have to rely on the current laws-The Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to conduct the elections.\u201d\n\nIn a similar reaction, Director Information and Voter Education INEC, Ayo Victor Aluko, said the commission would not speculate or pre-empt the National Assembly on this controversy.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are waiting for the legislature the executive to finish their jobs so as to do our job. However, the commission will rely on existing relevant laws to do our job if eventually the Electoral Act Amendment bill was not signed into law. We cannot speculate or pre-empt the two arms of government.\u201d",

          "text": "Chinese state media report parcels mailed from overseas may have spread the omicron variant of the coronavirus in Beijing and elsewhere.\n\nGlobally, health experts have stressed the virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets when infected people breathe, speak, cough and sneeze. However, China has repeatedly emphasized the danger of infection from packaging, despite only trace amounts of the virus being found on such items, and it has boosted testing of frozen food and regular items shipped from overseas.\n\nThe Communist Party newspaper Global Times cited the Beijing Center for Disease Control and virologists as making the link between the latest infections and packages from abroad. The report Tuesday said investigators found people newly infected had picked up packages mailed from Canada and the U.S.\n\nChina has locked down parts of Beijing\u2019s Haidian district following the detection of three cases, just weeks before the Chinese capital is due to host the Winter Olympic Games. Another person in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen who tested positive for omicron had handled packages sent from North America.\n\nChina remains on high alert for new outbreaks ahead of the Olympics.

Falling numbers of cases in Xi\u2019an, a city of 13 million famed as the home of the Terracotta Warrior statue army, have prompted authorities to allow people to gradually leave their homes and return to work.\n\nJust one additional case was reported in the city among China\u2019s total of 127 new domestically transmitted cases announced on Tuesday.",

Now, it is on the table of NigComSat to answer that question. I want to make sure that as I said that 2022 is NigComSat year along with NIPOST. I want to make sure that all work in progress must be completed by 2022.\n\n\u201cAs I said earlier ,2022 has been dedicated to NigComSat and NIPOST, and I want to do the best I can to improve what we have achieved in the previous years.\n\n\u201cI recently approved two subsidiaries of NigComSat and I am here to supervise what they have been doing, and I discovered some areas where we need to work to improve their performance significantly.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that for the agency not to be considered for privatisation again, it must provide quality service and generate good revenue.\n\nHe added: \u201cBefore I was made the Director General, National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), there was the Oronsaye report which recommended for the scrapping of NITDA. But when I was able to turn things around from generation of N7 billion to N19 billion in a year, no one talks about scrapping NITDA again.\n\n\u201cSo if you are able to turn things around, render quality service and generate income, no one will talk of privatising your company again.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, the Director General, NigComSat, Abimbola Alike appreciated the minister for his immense support.\n\nAlike stated: \u201cWe all know what our budget used to be N200 million-N300m, for a company that needs capital after overhead.\n\n\u201cHe stood for us and said there must be something good in NigComSat because he is a man who believes that we can actually turn around NigComSat.\u201d\n\nShe assured Pantami of the agency\u2019s readiness to deliver quality service and generate revenue to justify his efforts at revitalising the agency.\n\nAccording to her, this year, Nigerians would see new significant changes that will make them know that NigComSat is a new company.\n\nShe stressed that Pantami was the first minister to add NigComSat to the National Broadband Plan (NBP).\n\nOghenevwede Ohwovoriole\n\nin Abuja",

          "text": "After eight months of consecutive decline, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which measures the level of inflation rose to 15.63 per cent year on year in December compared to 15.40 per cent in the preceding month, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), disclosed Monday.\n\nThe headline index had maintained steady decline from April 2021 to November 2021, before returning to the upward trajectory in December.\n\nYear-on-year, the composite food sub-index stood at 17.37 per cent compared to 19.56 per cent in December, 2020.\n\nAccording to the statistical agency, the rise in the food sub-index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals, food product not elsewhere classified (n.e.c), meat, fish, potatoes, yam and other tuber, soft drinks and fruit.\n\nOn month-on-month basis, the food index increased to 2.19 per cent from 1.07 per cent in November.\n\nOn the other hand, core inflation which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce increased to 13.87 per cent compared to 11.37 per cent in the preceding month.\n\nInflation stood at 18.12 per cent in April, 17.93 in May, 17.75 per cent June, 17.38 per cent in July, 17.01 in August, 16.63 per cent in September, 15.99 in October and 15.40 per cent in November.\n\nAccording to the CPI figures for December, the 0.23 per cent increase was occasioned by the increase in prices of goods and services as a result of increase in their demand during the month under review, being a festive season.\n\nMonth-on-month basis, the headline index increased by 1.82 per cent in December which is 0.74 per cent higher than the 1.08 per cent recorded in the preceding month.\n\nHowever, the urban inflation rate stood at 16.17 per cent (year-on-year) compared to 16.33 per cent recorded in December 2020, while the rural index moderated to 15.11 per cent in December from 15.20 per cent 2020.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the urban index rose to 1.87 per cent compared to 1.12 per cent, while the rural index also rose to 1.77 per from 1.04 per cent.\n\nThe NBS noted that, \u201cThe change in the declining trend for about eight months might have been caused by the increase in prices of goods and services as a result of increase in their demand during the month under review, being a festive season.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the latest inflation, the Economist/CEO, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, noted that the surge in demand during the December festivities, \u201cmust have played a role in the marginal spike and reversal of the deceleration trend in headline inflation.\u201d\n\nYusuf, who is the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, added: \u201cMeanwhile, inflationary pressures remain a significant macroeconomic risk in the Nigerian economy. It is a major concern to both businesses and the citizens.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that the high inflationary pressures remain a major concern to stakeholders in the Nigeria economy, he listed some of its implications to include escalation of production and operating costs for businesses, leading to erosion of profit margins, drop in sales, decline in turnover and weak manufacturing capacity utilisation.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, other implications are: \u201chigh food prices which impacts adversely on citizens\u2019 welfare and aggravates poverty; weak purchasing power which poses significant risk to business sustainability and price volatility which undermines investors\u2019 confidence.\u201d\n\nIn order to tame the current inflationary pressure, Yusuf urged the government need to: \u201cReform the foreign exchange market to stabilise the exchange rate and reduce volatility; address forex liquidity issues through appropriate policy measures; address the security concerns causing disruption to agricultural activities.\n\n\u201cAddress productivity issues in the real sector of the economy; address the challenge of high transportation cost; reduce fiscal deficit financing by the CBN to minimise incidence of high-powered money in the economy, and manage climate change consequences to reduce flooding and desertification.\u201d\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",
