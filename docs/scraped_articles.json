          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nA Consultant Urologist, Ogah Hospital and Urology Centre, Fugar, Edo State, Dr. Gabriel Ogah said age, pelvic organ prolapse, and enlarged prostate are predisposing factors to urinary incontinence.\n\nThe urologist, however, said while the causes of the condition differ among males and females, it is mostly seen in the context of childbirth in women.\n\nOgah, nevertheless, noted that the most common cause of urinary incontinence is prostate enlargement, particularly in older men.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Ogah however, urged Nigerians with the health condition to seek treatment, noting that urinary incontinence can be reversed if treated effectively.\n\nUrinary incontinence, he said, is the inability to control one\u2019s urine as control over the urinary sphincter is either lost or weakened.\n\n\u201cNormally before a person passes urine, you have to decide that the time is appropriate, the environment is appropriate and you decide consciously to pass urine.\n\n\u201cWhen you are not ready to pass it, then you hold it until it\u2019s convenient but when the urine comes out on its own without you being in total control, we will say it\u2019s urinary incontinence.\n\n\u201cThe causes depend on the age of children. Some children are born with it and we call it bedwetting, we have some children who bed wet when they go to bed and they outgrow it when they become older but some children bed wet all through the time they are in secondary school and their classmates will make jest of them.\n\n\u201cWe have adults who bed wet but the causes differ for both male and female\u201d\n\nExplaining, the urologist said when a lady is bedwetting, it may be because such a person has urinary problems from the brain and is unable to control her urine.\n\n\u201cEven at night, they produce excess urine or ladies may bed wet because they have something blocking the exit of the urine from their bladder when you have a urethral infection,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that fibroid can also expand the uterus and press against the bladder, reducing its capacity to hold urine or block the outflow for urine to pass.\n\n\u201cFor men, bedwetting is not as common as it is for women or children. When a male adult bed wets, it is because they have an enlarged prostate which is blocking their flow of urine so that when they lie down, the urinary bladder is distended with urine and will not be able to control the urine.\n\n\u201cSo an old man who is 60 or 75 goes to bed and wet it usually because there is a blockage on the urinary flow due to prostate.\n\n\u201cThen a man may also have urinary incontinence after a prostate operation,\u201d he said.\n\nOgah further said elderly women can have urinary incontinence if they have a prolapse.\n\n\u201cAfter they give birth to lots of children, after menopause, the pelvic floor of the virginal wall is weak and you find that the womb tends to come down and we call that urethral prolapse,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert advised that when one experiences urinary incontinence or changes in urination, it is better to consult the doctor or healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n\nHe noted that the condition can be treated with a variety of medications and surgery.\n\n\u201cIf women have urinary incontinence due to prolapse, you treat it either by conservative means or by surgery. If they have fibroid causing incontinence, they can also treat it. There are also drugs you can take that will control it.\n\n\u201cWhen elderly men have incontinence due to enlarged prostate, we treat it either by medication or with an operation.\n\n\u201cFor both men and women, there are also artificial urinary sphincters you can put to prevent incontinence,\u201d he said.\n\nA study carried out on the prevalence, quality of life assessment of urinary incontinence among women dwelling in a rural community in Southwest, Nigeria showed that urinary incontinence is a debilitating disease that impacts on quality of life of affected individuals.\n\nThe researchers led by Dr. Olajide Abiola of the Department of Surgery, Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso, Oyo state said in most rural communities in Nigeria, there are limited health care resources to managed patients with such debilitating conditions which required specialised care.\n\n\u201cPrevalence was 12.6 per cent and stress urinary incontinence was the commonest type. Poor quality of life was reported in 65.5 per cent of those afflicted with urinary incontinence. The worsening quality of life had positive correlates with age, amount of urine loss, frequency of urine leakage, and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire scores. Perceived bothersomeness of symptoms were associated with ICIQ score of \u22658,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe researchers noted that the most prevalent type of urinary incontinence was stress UI (58.6 percent), followed by urge UI (27.6 percent) and mixed UI (13.8 percent).\n\n\u201cThis finding further corroborated earlier reports from epidemiological studies of UI in Nigeria in which stress incontinence was the commonest type of UI among women with UI.5,\u201d they said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Tope Omogbolagun\n\nCancer is generally defined as the growth of abnormal tissues in the body and usually, those abnormal tissues spread so fast that they begin to affect other organs and parts of the body.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. Other terms used are malignant tumours and neoplasms. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs; the latter process is referred to as metastasis. Widespread metastases are the primary cause of death from cancer.\n\nCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020, or nearly one in six deaths, the WHO stated. Also, estimates from the International Agency for Research on Cancer said that in 2018 there were 17 million new cancer cases and 9.5 million cancer deaths worldwide, adding that by 2040, the global burden is expected to grow to 27.5 million new cancer cases and 16.3 million cancer deaths simply due to the growth and ageing of the population.\n\nThe most common cancers are breast, lung, colon and rectum and prostate. The most common in 2020 in terms of new cases of cancer were breast, with 2.26 million cases; lung, 2.21 million cases; colon and rectum, 1.93 million cases; prostate, 1.41 million cases; skin, non-melanoma, 1.20 million cases; and stomach, 1.09 million cases.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, about 70,000 (28,414 males and 41,913 females) cancer deaths occur annually, and 102,000 new cases are diagnosed from its population of about 200 million people. These are, however, estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, the Centre for Disease Control in the United States pointed out that breast cancer is characterised by the abnormal growth of cells in the breast and the most common malignant disorder affecting women. Globally, the mortality rate as a result of breast cancer is about 685,000 and about 18,000 deaths in Nigeria, a report by a cancer awareness organisation, projectpinkblue.org, stated.\n\nOver the years, experts have maintained that early detection is one of the ways to prevent mortality in cancer patients.\n\nInterestingly, there have been various innovations in cancer treatment, from chemotherapy to monogamy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and the likes. The most recent have been cancer-detecting innovations.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Healthineers, Bernd Montag, said the global cancer burden is rising, especially in low and medium-income centres. The facts are evident, now we need to prepare for the future. To fight cancer, we need to detect and treat it as early and precisely as possible. Innovations such as low-dose CT-enabled national lung cancer screening programmes can help reduce mortality rates.\n\nHe added that technology was crucial. With rapidly increasing medical evidence coupled with a decreasing supply of medical experts, digitalisation can bridge the gap with patients. We have had good experiences, for example with telemedicine for COVID-19 patients and with AI-based assistants that support doctors in making decisions. These experiences are transferable to the care of cancer patients.\n\nAlso, the CEO/Founder of Earli, Cyriac Roeding, said the world had made major progress in cancer treatment options in the previous decades, from immunotherapies to gene therapy. Yet, the single biggest lever in saving lives lies in early cancer detection. The five-year survival rates for the top five cancers are four to 13 times higher at stage one versus stage four, depending on the type of cancer.\n\nRoeding said, \u201cWe must get better at screening and diagnosing earlier. Fortunately, three radical innovations are emerging: liquid biopsies find cancer signals in blood samples; AI analyses body scans in places where top imaging experts are not available; and synthetic biopsies flip the whole concept of detection on its head. Instead of searching for cancer, the cancer is being forced to reveal, locate and eventually kill itself using synthetic biology.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that in 2122, we will look back at 2022 and say that was when critical early detection technologies really emerged,\u201d he said.\n\nCorroborating others, a Consultant General Surgeon Dr. Arinzechukwu Mosanya, stressed that early detection in the treatment of breast cancer was very important in its treatment.\n\nHe said, \u201cBreast cancer is more common in older females than in young females. The older a woman gets, the higher the chances of developing breast cancer. A lifestyle that is not healthy can also predispose women to cancer.\n\n\u201cThe most common symptom that a woman will have is swelling, commonly referred to as a breast lump. But that doesn\u2019t mean that all lumps are breast cancer; once a woman notices a lump in the breast, she should see a physician who would guide her through the process of evaluating the lump to know if it is breast cancer or not.\n\n\u201cBreast cancer is from stage zero to four. Stage zero is when breast cancer is confined to individual cells in the breast. Usually, these are detected in women who go for screening, as there may not be any visible or palpable lump. Stage four breast cancer refers to breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body with very poor prognosis and outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreast cancer is a disease that doesn\u2019t kill especially if it is discovered early and that is why we do say that early detection saves lives. This is the reason we are coming together again to tell you that there is hope. He stressed the need for women to go for regular medical checkups, breast self-examination, clinical examination and mammography in a bid to detect the disease at an early stage.\n\nIn a recent development in the fight against breast cancer, some innovators have developed certain bras to help with early detection of breast cancer.\n\nOne of the popular brands is Eva bra made by Julian Rios Cantu and his three friends which they said would be an early warning system for breast cancer symptoms.\n\nThey explained that cancerous tumours may trigger a different temperature due to increased blood flow. The idea of the Eva bra is that biosensors would measure temperatures, log them in an app and alert a user to any disturbing changes. Women using the bra would need to wear it for 60-90 minutes a week to get accurate measurements.\n\nAlso, students from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland, teamed up with the startup, IcosaMed, to develop the SmartBra that can be used for cancer detection.\n\nOne of the students on the development team, Hugo Vuillet, in an interview said the smart-clothing technology was designed to detect cancer at the earliest stages. \u201cIt uses a non-invasive, painless method based on frequent ultrasound monitoring,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the development took more than two years with an investment of \u201cseveral million pesos\u201d (the monetary unit of several countries in the Americas and the Philippines) received through various grants. He said recovering the investment was not the goal in this first stage, but gathering more data to improve detection of algorithms for different pathologies.\n\nRios Cantu said Eva had many strategic partners ranging from enterprises to associations, to private hospitals and to public agencies such as the Mexican Institute of Social Security.\n\nThe students came up with their design during a Master\u2019s-level class, called Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Engineering, which was run for the first time last fall. The class is given jointly by the School of Engineering and the College of Management of Technology and aims to expose students to the challenges entrepreneurs face as they develop new products. Student teams worked closely with local businesses to develop a marketable product that meets a need identified by the company they teamed up with.\n\nThe SmartBra student team composed of Vuillet as well as Fatemeh Ghadamieh, Samet Hana and Jules Pochon \u2013 obtained the highest score and received an award from a selection panel made up of EPFL professors. Their system proved so effective that the company they worked with, IcosaMed, a Neuch\u00e2tel-based startup founded in March 2019, decided to continue the partnership.\n\nIcosaMed\u2019s technology emits ultrasound waves \u2013 like those employed in high-intensity focused ultrasound and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound \u2013 to perform echography scans for potentially cancerous cells. The ultrasound waves are generated using piezoelectric sensors, which are devices that run on energy generated when pressure is applied to a piezoelectric material. \u201cThis technology is what allows us to miniaturise the SmartBra\u2019s detection system so that it\u2019s still comfortable to wear and nearly imperceptible,\u201d says Vuillet.\n\nOutside of the Eva and smart bras, there have been other innovations that were invented to help the cancer battle but the most recent is another smart bra invented by a Nigerian woman, Kemisola Bolarinwa.\n\nBolarinwa, a robotic and embedded systems engineer, invented a smart bra capable of detecting breast cancer in its early stage.\n\nShe told BBC News Pidgin that she was inspired to come up with such an innovation after losing her aunt to breast cancer in 2017.\n\nShe said, \u201cIn 2021, I was able to do a test run on a prototype of the smart bra. The bra has small sensors coupled with its nanotechnology that doesn\u2019t cause harm to the body tissues.\n\n\u201cThis bra doesn\u2019t replace normal bra or is worn throughout the day. This particular bra is worn during the breast cancer check which doesn\u2019t last more than five minutes.\u201d\n\nSome oncologists have lauded the innovations, saying it would help in the fight against cancer since early detection is one of the quickest ways to combat the disease.\n\nAn oncologist, Dr. Kehinde Ololade, said two of those bras had been witnessed in recent times; the first being the Eva bra and the other one that uses light sensors.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am aware that one uses light and the Eva bra reads via blood tissues. It is a welcome innovation when it\u2019s out it can only test the tissues. So far, those bras are not known to have passed through any clinical test; they are just experiments. But we would continue to encourage them in order for science and technology to help come up with innovations that will help fight cancer while a little more work should be done.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe could have accelerated trial just like we had for COVID-19, or they could come up with one that has a little longer period.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the one that relies on increased blood flow in the breast has its shortcoming because other activities in the body could cause increased blood flow.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIf there is increased activity in the breast whether as a result of lactation or excitement and there is an increased blood flow in the breast, the bra that checks with blood flows will present such activities as cancer. Whenever there is a lump in the breast, there is usually an increased activity of blood flow in that part of the breast, so it is the same way the sensors in the bra would read those activities.\n\n\u201cThe sensors inside a bra would mean the breasts were in the same position each time measurements were taken. It means more work needs to be done scientifically. Generally, it\u2019s a welcome development that needs more scientific work.\u201d\n\nAnother oncologist, Dr. Bukola Oshikanlu, described the innovation as a good development especially because it has the ability to help in the early detection of cancer which is fundamental to the cure of the disease.\n\nShe said, \u201cYes it will, but for women who detect abnormal signals from their breasts, they should then go for additional tests to confirm if truly they have breast cancer. An additional clinical test is needed to confirm that it is breast cancer and once the diagnosis is confirmed, they should commence treatment immediately.\u201d\n\nExperts have welcomed the idea but they believe the innovation needs more clinical testing before it can stand as an early cancer detection solution.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

We have had good experiences, for example with telemedicine for COVID-19 patients and with AI-based assistants that support doctors in making decisions. These experiences are transferable to the care of cancer patients.\n\nAlso, the CEO/Founder of Earli, Cyriac Roeding, said the world had made major progress in cancer treatment options in the previous decades, from immunotherapies to gene therapy. Yet, the single biggest lever in saving lives lies in early cancer detection. The five-year survival rates for the top five cancers are four to 13 times higher at stage one versus stage four, depending on the type of cancer.\n\nRoeding said, \u201cWe must get better at screening and diagnosing earlier. Fortunately, three radical innovations are emerging: liquid biopsies find cancer signals in blood samples; AI analyses body scans in places where top imaging experts are not available; and synthetic biopsies flip the whole concept of detection on its head. Instead of searching for cancer, the cancer is being forced to reveal, locate and eventually kill itself using synthetic biology.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that in 2122, we will look back at 2022 and say that was when critical early detection technologies really emerged,\u201d he said.\n\nCorroborating others, a Consultant General Surgeon Dr. Arinzechukwu Mosanya, stressed that early detection in the treatment of breast cancer was very important in its treatment.\n\nHe said, \u201cBreast cancer is more common in older females than in young females. The older a woman gets, the higher the chances of developing breast cancer. A lifestyle that is not healthy can also predispose women to cancer.\n\n\u201cThe most common symptom that a woman will have is swelling, commonly referred to as a breast lump. But that doesn\u2019t mean that all lumps are breast cancer; once a woman notices a lump in the breast, she should see a physician who would guide her through the process of evaluating the lump to know if it is breast cancer or not.\n\n\u201cBreast cancer is from stage zero to four. Stage zero is when breast cancer is confined to individual cells in the breast. Usually, these are detected in women who go for screening, as there may not be any visible or palpable lump. Stage four breast cancer refers to breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body with very poor prognosis and outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreast cancer is a disease that doesn\u2019t kill especially if it is discovered early and that is why we do say that early detection saves lives. This is the reason we are coming together again to tell you that there is hope. He stressed the need for women to go for regular medical checkups, breast self-examination, clinical examination and mammography in a bid to detect the disease at an early stage.\n\nIn a recent development in the fight against breast cancer, some innovators have developed certain bras to help with early detection of breast cancer.\n\nOne of the popular brands is Eva bra made by Julian Rios Cantu and his three friends which they said would be an early warning system for breast cancer symptoms.\n\nThey explained that cancerous tumours may trigger a different temperature due to increased blood flow. The idea of the Eva bra is that biosensors would measure temperatures, log them in an app and alert a user to any disturbing changes. Women using the bra would need to wear it for 60-90 minutes a week to get accurate measurements.\n\nAlso, students from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne, Switzerland, teamed up with the startup, IcosaMed, to develop the SmartBra that can be used for cancer detection.\n\nOne of the students on the development team, Hugo Vuillet, in an interview said the smart-clothing technology was designed to detect cancer at the earliest stages. \u201cIt uses a non-invasive, painless method based on frequent ultrasound monitoring,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the development took more than two years with an investment of \u201cseveral million pesos\u201d (the monetary unit of several countries in the Americas and the Philippines) received through various grants. He said recovering the investment was not the goal in this first stage, but gathering more data to improve detection of algorithms for different pathologies.\n\nRios Cantu said Eva had many strategic partners ranging from enterprises to associations, to private hospitals and to public agencies such as the Mexican Institute of Social Security.\n\nThe students came up with their design during a Master\u2019s-level class, called Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Engineering, which was run for the first time last fall. The class is given jointly by the School of Engineering and the College of Management of Technology and aims to expose students to the challenges entrepreneurs face as they develop new products. Student teams worked closely with local businesses to develop a marketable product that meets a need identified by the company they teamed up with.\n\nThe SmartBra student team composed of Vuillet as well as Fatemeh Ghadamieh, Samet Hana and Jules Pochon \u2013 obtained the highest score and received an award from a selection panel made up of EPFL professors. Their system proved so effective that the company they worked with, IcosaMed, a Neuch\u00e2tel-based startup founded in March 2019, decided to continue the partnership.\n\nIcosaMed\u2019s technology emits ultrasound waves \u2013 like those employed in high-intensity focused ultrasound and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound \u2013 to perform echography scans for potentially cancerous cells. The ultrasound waves are generated using piezoelectric sensors, which are devices that run on energy generated when pressure is applied to a piezoelectric material. \u201cThis technology is what allows us to miniaturise the SmartBra\u2019s detection system so that it\u2019s still comfortable to wear and nearly imperceptible,\u201d says Vuillet.\n\nOutside of the Eva and smart bras, there have been other innovations that were invented to help the cancer battle but the most recent is another smart bra invented by a Nigerian woman, Kemisola Bolarinwa.\n\nBolarinwa, a robotic and embedded systems engineer, invented a smart bra capable of detecting breast cancer in its early stage.\n\nShe told BBC News Pidgin that she was inspired to come up with such an innovation after losing her aunt to breast cancer in 2017.\n\nShe said, \u201cIn 2021, I was able to do a test run on a prototype of the smart bra. The bra has small sensors coupled with its nanotechnology that doesn\u2019t cause harm to the body tissues.\n\n\u201cThis bra doesn\u2019t replace normal bra or is worn throughout the day. This particular bra is worn during the breast cancer check which doesn\u2019t last more than five minutes.\u201d\n\nSome oncologists have lauded the innovations, saying it would help in the fight against cancer since early detection is one of the quickest ways to combat the disease.\n\nAn oncologist, Dr. Kehinde Ololade, said two of those bras had been witnessed in recent times; the first being the Eva bra and the other one that uses light sensors.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am aware that one uses light and the Eva bra reads via blood tissues. It is a welcome innovation when it\u2019s out it can only test the tissues. So far, those bras are not known to have passed through any clinical test; they are just experiments. But we would continue to encourage them in order for science and technology to help come up with innovations that will help fight cancer while a little more work should be done.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe could have accelerated trial just like we had for COVID-19, or they could come up with one that has a little longer period.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the one that relies on increased blood flow in the breast has its shortcoming because other activities in the body could cause increased blood flow.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIf there is increased activity in the breast whether as a result of lactation or excitement and there is an increased blood flow in the breast, the bra that checks with blood flows will present such activities as cancer. Whenever there is a lump in the breast, there is usually an increased activity of blood flow in that part of the breast, so it is the same way the sensors in the bra would read those activities.\n\n\u201cThe sensors inside a bra would mean the breasts were in the same position each time measurements were taken. It means more work needs to be done scientifically. Generally, it\u2019s a welcome development that needs more scientific work.\u201d\n\nAnother oncologist, Dr. Bukola Oshikanlu, described the innovation as a good development especially because it has the ability to help in the early detection of cancer which is fundamental to the cure of the disease.\n\nShe said, \u201cYes it will, but for women who detect abnormal signals from their breasts, they should then go for additional tests to confirm if truly they have breast cancer. An additional clinical test is needed to confirm that it is breast cancer and once the diagnosis is confirmed, they should commence treatment immediately.\u201d\n\nExperts have welcomed the idea but they believe the innovation needs more clinical testing before it can stand as an early cancer detection solution.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "God, professionalism ,devotion to Nigeria helped my military career \u2013 Ambassador Buratai",
          "text": "By Jimitota Onoyume, Assistant News Editor\n\nLieutenant General Tukur Buratai, rtd, .Ambassador of Nigeria to Benin Republic speaks extensively on some aspects of his private life, how he found himself in the Nigerian army.\n\nHis has been a life of passionate service , laced with sacrifice for the common good of Nigeria .\n\nHis dreams from childhood had always woven around the drive to add value to his environment. This explains why as a young boy on the streets of Buratai village in his Biu local government area, Borno state his first job ever was mentoring young children in a primary school\n\nHe said before the opportunity came to join the army he had settled for the classroom as a primary school teacher . Buratai bares it all in this personality interview.\n\nAs he spoke, occasionally he would wink at this reporter with a bright smile on his face, an unconscious act revealing the gold like nature of his innermost being.\n\nOur path crossed when he was Brigade Commander of the former 2 Brigade , Port Harcourt , now in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state. And since then we have maintained a very robust relationship, even while he was Chief of Army Staff.\n\nWhen I initiated move for a personality interview, I had expected he would ask me to meet him in Abuja but , the order, in the usual military manner came, \u201d come to the Embassy in Cotonou on Sunday\u201d.\n\nI fetched my passport and saw that I could make it on that Sunday. Quickly I left my Warri base in Delta state ahead of the Sunday to Lagos to tidy up things. By noon hours of that Sunday I was at the Nigeria Embassy house in Cotonou, Benin Republic.\n\nOne of his aides who had been briefed on my coming later arranged for me to be chauffeur driven to a hotel barely a kilometer from the Embassy. I gathered a former President of the country lives in the same hood.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe hotel in their tradition demanded for my valid identity card before I was checked into a room. Minutes after I settled down, I wanted a cup of coffee and lunch. I dialed the numbers provided beside the intercom and language barrier started. I spoke English and the receiver responded in french language. I had to drop the call.It dawned on me that I will depend on google for communication in the hotel.\n\nTo save me from loosing so much of my data to roaming the hotel had connected all my device to WiFi so I hit google. I typed French word for lunch and coffee, they came up..And I called back, read all I saw on google. At least we started talking. She noticed my accent was poor but she understood me . Most of what she said after confirming I wanted coffee and lunch, I didn\u2019t get.\n\nMinutes later coffee was delivered to my room. The only English word the guy who came to deliver it could mutter was , \u201cfinish\u201d. Whenever he came to my room before leaving , he would raise his two hands up and say \u201cfinish\u201d. And I would say merci. Whenever I did , the guy would just smile before walking out. It was fun, google was really helpful in most of our interactions..\n\nMeeting with the Ambassador\n\nAt about 7pm.the same vehicle came to pick me to the Embassy to meet the Ambassador. Decked in a well tailored traditional Hausa outfit and a cap to match he motioned me to a seat in his office.\n\nIn his usual hospitable manner, he asked \u201d hope you enjoyed your meal. Am sure rice may be the few things on the menu you will be relaxed with \u201c, I nodded. He called for coffee. And another special tea made in northern part of Nigeria was added to the tray \u201d You will like this when mixed with your coffee. It\u2019s a product that will soon hit the market in Nigeria \u201c,.he said..As we did coffee , his aide took some snap shots. He knew I would need them .\n\nFinally, we settled down for the business of the day.\n\nAt the end, we.delved into a review of a statement he had released some days before, advising Nigerian youths to shun temptations to indulge in acts of violence before and during the coming general elections .\n\nHe said he chose Benin Republic for the interview and on a Sunday because he wanted a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nYou occupy a very prominent space in the story of Nigeria Army. Let\u2019s see how it started.\n\nANSWER: As a Muslim who believes in destiny and the power of the Almighty to decide the fate of anyone, I will start by saying Alhamdulillahi (Thanks and glory be to Allah). I remember with nostalgia how a friend of mine came to meet me and informed me about the Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) in 1980. It was a day to the entrance exams so I was among the last batch of applicants to hear and apply for the NDA.\n\nTo cut a long story short, my friend who brought the news to me couldn\u2019t make it when the results were released but I was lucky I got shortlisted, attended the Academy and commissioned in December 1983.\n\nIf there was anything that helped me in the Army, I would say it is my absolute faith in God, diligence, professionalism, training, personal development and devotion to Nigeria.\n\nThe Army was more than just a profession to me; it was my family and I gave it all my best. I took everyone in the Army regardless of where the soldier or officer hailed from as my family. I put in every effort to build a track record characterized by courage, honesty, loyalty, professionalism and patriotism. Wherever I served I tried to put in my best. I also tried to identify people with prospects, people who were diligent and highly skillful in what they did.\n\nI gave such kind of people responsibilities and as they delivered; I gave them more responsibilities. I don\u2019t like mediocrity or slackness in duty. It was in the course of performing my duties as I know best that President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR identified and appointed me as the 20th Chief of Army Staff of the Nigerian Army. Not only that, God gave me the opportunity to serve for sixty-months which is roughly about six years or so. I think it is natural for one to become an authority in a profession that he or she served for about forty years.\n\nYou said I occupy a very prominent space in the Nigerian Army, and you\u2019re right. A lot of people also said so. I think it is because of my inherent ability to mentor others and give them the opportunity to excel. Before I joined the Army I was a teacher and you know what that means.\n\nWhat influenced you to join the army as a young youth?\n\nANSWER: It\u2019s public knowledge that my late father, Baba Yusufu Buratai was a World War veteran so I am not new to the army. The fact that my father was a soldier influenced me to join the army although there was never a time my father told me to join the army. In fact, it was after my name was shortlisted after the entrance exams that I informed him about my decision to join the army.\n\nNevertheless I believe that the kind of discipline, orderliness and courage I saw in him made me to respect the army. But I think, naturally, I am a person who likes challenges, adventure and taking risks. I also wanted to identify with Nigeria, to do something great for Nigeria. The army provided me with that opportunity.\n\nWhat else was your alternative if you had not joined the army and why?\n\nANSWER: I was a teacher; I got trained at the Teachers\u2019 College, Potiskum. I taught for a while in Buratai before I joined Borno College of Basic Studies as a gateway to get admitted into the university. So, who knows, I could have ended up as a teacher or a university lecturer. Life is like a journey to a country that one has never been to before, so you keep on moving no matter what, and God will be bringing surprises to you.\n\nI had several encouraging encounters with my teachers .\n\nTeaching is a noble profession, you impact knowledge to better citizens. . I felt it was a profession I should pursue.\n\nInterestingly while in the army, I found myself teaching at some point. One of the assessment criteria of officers in the military , is that you are expected to be exposed to various areas of command, instructional and staff .I found myself as a directing staff in the Armed Forces Command and Staff College JaJi.\n\nYou cannot go back to teach or instruct in the military institution if your performance is not above average. Through hard work I got the very good scores that got me to be invited back to the college to teach at the armed forces.\n\nAnd that really helped me. That period I stayed as a directing staff, almost three years, I came to know so many officers . And some I really worked with as Chief of Army Staff .\n\nI came back as a Director at a time again to the Department of Land warfare in the armed forces command and staff college, there I met a lot of officers in the army. And when I became Chief of Army Staff, it was easy to relate with them in that category.\n\nMany of them are still in service . I look forward to a robust hardworking and professional military officers.\n\nIt was after my stay in the staff college as a director from there I went to Port Harcourt as a Brigade commander. I came back again to JaJi again this time to the Nigerian Army school of infantry . I presided over the school, directed, and administered and run courses for officers and soldiers.\n\nInterestingly because of my flare for teaching those period I was in the schools , colleges, it was full of dynamism, activities, initiative, vibrancy , achieving result, keeping the students in sound and conducive environment to learn.\n\nThat is why when I was Chief of Army Staff, I still continued to mentor. As a commander you must know that it is one thing to pass a directive it is another thing for the recipient to understand the statement as a directive, understand the content.\n\nIf he understands the content it is good. But if he does not understand, he cannot execute that directive . This is why there is need to follow up on directives to ensure it is executed properly. If you assessed somebody more than two times and you are satisfied , you begin to give the officer or commander the latitude to exhibit his own initiative and capacity to achieve results.\n\nI see this in all my officers, especially the present Chief.of army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya. He notes every details , he understand every instructions and follow it up even the Chief of Defence Staff. It\u2019s a good development.\n\nIn terms of academic environment as luck will have it and designed by the almighty God after being commissioned I went to the University of Maiduguri and got a Masters and first degree there. I got another masters at Bangladesh there also. The studies further broaden my horizon, knowledge of life better.\n\nI brought all these knowledge gained into my military operations. I am happy with the recognitions so far from several universities.\n\nKaduna state University gave me a honorary doctorate degree, Igbinedion university , Okada , Edo state , gave me Professor at large. In Adamawa Modibu university , Yola, also ecognised me. I even gave the convocation lecture. About three weeks ago I was at the national defence college where I gave lecture on strategic leadership\n\nWhile in service I was called at the African centre in Washington, I gave talk. I was invited twice at the Royal United servicing institute in UK, London where I delivered lectures. I was in Rwanda to discuss issues with the defence services command and staff college. I look forward to more academic engagement.\n\nI have three centres named after me , one in Igbinedion University, Tukur Buratai centre for contemporary security affairs . At the Nigerian army University Biu, there is the Tukur Buratai institute for war and peace. And at the Ebonyi state university, i have a centre for security studies .I am also establishing my centre, Tukur Buratai research centre\n\nSo, I am trying to tell you that there are other things I could have done with my life apart from the army that I might not even know. For example, apart from teaching, I also like farming and sports. Also, don\u2019t forget that I am now a diplomat. Destiny has a lot to play in one\u2019s life. It is good to have a plan but at the end it is what God destined that is going to happen.\n\nNo doubt you enjoy a sense of fulfilment after a successful military career. Let\u2019s hear how you feel in retirement now.\n\nANSWER: My number one and primary constituency is Nigeria, and as I have told you earlier, I have served this country as an army officer and chief of army staff to the best of my ability. I may not have achieved all my objectives and targets for the Nigerian Army but Nigerians know that I left it far better than I met it.\n\nThere is no area or facet of the Nigerian Army that our leadership has not touched and transformed. Is it troops\u2019 welfare or training and re-training? Is it infrastructural and manpower development or safeguarding the democratic institution of our country? Is it the counter-insurgency operations against insurgents, terrorists and other criminal gangs? Name it.\n\nWe crushed Boko Haram in less than two years but they got international support from al-Baghadadi and formed ISWAP after that; we did our best. So I have no regrets whatsoever. I am thankful to God for the opportunity to serve, and the guidance He gave me to serve meritoriously. Most of the crop of leaders we have in the army today received some form of mentorship and leadership training from me, and they are all doing well today.\n\nAlso, when I thought I will just be confined to my farm in retirement, God willed otherwise. The President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, decided to appoint me and my colleagues as non-career ambassadors. So I am enjoying my retirement although you must know that we were retired but not tired. We will continue to serve this country in whatever capacity God gives.\n\nOn a lighter note, do you cook? Was there any time in your career you made meals yourself?\n\nANSWER:\n\n(Laughs) Hahaha! Of course I know how to cook. I learned how to survive on my own at a very early stage in my life so cooking is one of those things I learned early. But to be frank, I no longer cook these days but I cooked in my early days as a junior officer. You know I was posted to Rivers State after my commissioning in 1983 so I have to cook on my own before I got married and got settled.\n\nWhat kind of meal can you make with much ease?\n\nANSWER: Well! I like traditional or local dishes a lot. I like tuwon shinkafa and okro or baobab soup. I also like fruit salad and tea.\n\nWhat kind of music appeal to you?\n\nANSWER: Music of the 70s and 80s. I still listen to country music Don Williams and Kerry Refters and so on. I also listen to contemporary Nigerian music.\n\nYour Excellency Sir, we are in an age when there is so much desperation on the path of many young ones to make money without any history of hard work, Some are into rituals, there is the Yahoo economy angle and all that. Is there any story you will like to share with them possibly to change their perception that hard work doesn\u2019t pay anymore?\n\nANSWER: You are right; the youth of nowadays is in a hurry to make it in life because we live in a digital age that is characterized by speed. At times I get flabbergasted by the kind of success some young people achieve at a very tender age of say 27 or at the most 30;success without hard work, without diligence and excellence.\n\nI hear a lot of people argue that joblessness is the cause of this get rich quick syndrome but I beg to disagree. There are a lot of Nigerian youths who are doing their best to survive with menial jobs or as tailors, mechanics and carpenters. They worked for what they have, and there is nothing you can do to convince them to go into money rituals or the yahoo yahoo thing.\n\nSo, by and large, I think it has to do with our collective value system as a people. When we were growing up, our elders made us understand that honesty, hard work and patience pays at the end but today the society considers any young man without money or a big car and houses a failure. Thus, you see young people who are gainfully employed trying to leave above their means.\n\nAlso, the issue of peer group is another factor; most youths want to belong, to fit into a particular group, they want to impress others and violate their principles and honor. Anyway, some of them don\u2019t even have principles; that is why it is easy to use movies to influence them.My advice to today\u2019s youth is embrace excellence, diligence, hard work and patience.\n\nHe or she must strive to develop a reputation for excellence because there is nothing that succeeds like excellence. There is a limit that instant riches or favor and connections can take you to but if you become excellent through diligence in whatever you do, the sky will be your limit.\n\nAnd riches and fame will come your way. It doesn\u2019t matter the kind of legitimate trade or profession you are into; so long as you discharge your duty with excellence and diligence, you will succeed. So young people must respect their elders, especially their parents, shun drug abuse, respect constituted authority and pursue excellence. That is the best way to succeed in life.\n\nThe camera caught you several times smiling when you were in active service, was it part of your tactic as a military General to disarm or douse tension?\n\nANSWER: Is that so? Well I think this is how I am. It is better to smile to people than to frown one\u2019s face. When you smile, you make others to be at ease, it also makes one to be at ease and make better decisions. I also believe that it makes you to be a good communicator because I have discovered that people are more receptive to a person who smiles when speaking although there are times one has to look serious.\n\nWas there any decision you consider toughest you took in your military career, looking back now sir?\n\nANSWER: I took many tough decisions when I served this country as Army Chief; very, very many tough decisions that had to do with life and death or the career of soldiers and officers. But as you might be aware, these things are classified and I don\u2019t have permission to speak openly about them.\n\nYou said your father was a war veteran , your readers may want to see more on this\n\nOk . He was a soldier in the colonial army in the second world war. He fought alongside the British army. They went through the India sub continent then. They went through the present day Bangladesh.\n\nAfter he was discharged he later worked n the country, then in the northern Nigeria government when he came back. When the north east was created he moved there and he retired from there .\n\nhe was widely travelled.\n\nI had the opportunity of going with my father to see some.of the scenes in Bangladesh when I was at the Bangladesh defence college\n\nWhat is your game or sports?\n\nANSWER: I like track events. I am still proud of my NUGA 90 silver medal in 400m Relay. I ran for University of Maiduguri. I also enjoy playing chess, golf and badminton .\n\nIs politics on the table now that you are retired?\n\nANSWER: Time will tell. There is this clich\u00e9 that says, \u201cNever say never,\u201d so I can\u2019t say anything about that. As I told you earlier, I never knew that I will be serving this country as an ambassador but here I am serving Nigeria as an ambassador. So the main issue is service to humanity, to Nigerians but for now I am not a politician.\n\nGeneral sir, you may now speak on any subject of interest to you for this interview.\n\nANSWER: I don\u2019t have much to say except to admonish Nigerians to tread the path of peace. This is the only country we have so we must all play our parts well to see that peace is sustained across the country.\n\nIt is high time we started to see ourselves as Nigerians, as people of one destiny on a common mission. What we need is more justice and equity; there is enough for everyone to be comfortable\n\nNice talking to you sir.\n\nYou are welcome.",

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2013ONE of the frontline aspirants for the position of national chairman in the March 26 national convention of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Senator Tanko Almakura, has said that there was no veracity in the purported endorsement as a consensus candidate of one of the aspirants to the seat.\n\nSenator Almakura, who was the immediate past governor of Nasarawa state said Buhari is known for his uprightness and passion for due process, adding that anything from the president must come through due process and not unnamed sources.\n\nRecall that sources at the meeting President Buhari had with governors before he left Abuja to attend the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) at 50 in Nairobi, Kenya, had said APC\u2019s governors request for him to change his mind on his preference for Senator Abdullahi Adamu met a brick wall.\n\nFielding questions from journalists on whether his insistence to contest for the national chairman of the party was not an affront to the President, he said: \u201cNo. The sources of information (Buhari\u2019s endorsement of Senator Adamu) were not authentic. They were not genuine. And I know what Mr. President stands for, he always stands for what is right and due process.\n\n\u201cAnd unless I have an authoritative source of information that is clear. I still have my doubts. I have many avenues through which I can reach Mr. President and people around him. And since those speculations did not come through those avenues, I consider them as speculation.\n\n\u201cThat is why as I speak with you, my campaign is going with a different tempo, to ensure that my campaign is going far and wide to await the next line of action as directed by the party leadership.\u201d\n\nAsked why he was optimistic that he will emerge as the candidate of choice, Almakura said: \u201cYes, I\u2019m very optimistic. I am always an optimist until things prove themselves otherwise. And what has really given me hope for this optimism is the uprightness of Mr. President and his passion for due process.\n\n\u201cSo I believe that whatever comes from Mr. President must come through a process. And I consider the process for the emergence of leadership, I believe it\u2019s going to be transparent. I believe it\u2019s going to be fair.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe it is going to conform with the articles and sections of the Constitution dealing with that.\u201d\n\nSenator Almakura said it will be a disservice if as a committed member of APC if he fails to show interest in leading the party so that he\u2019ll be able to add value to the administration of the party.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m bringing to the table is the experience I\u2019ve garnered over time. Particularly, my participation in the merger taking into consideration the unanimity and total submission that the different tendencies in this country have had to do to ensure that we come as one united indivisible people with one destiny is something we must sustain, is something we must promote ao that younger Nigerians coming behind will benefit from this mutual understanding to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m also bringing to the table my experience with President Muhammadu Buhari because I\u2019ve learned the tutelage of transparency, good values, and commitment to what is good for everybody.\u201d",

If you believe in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice, 2023 is the turn of a woman to lead Abia.The men have failed us. In three senatorial zones, it has all been men ruling. I\u2019m not running as a woman but as a qualified woman. I think men should step aside and allow women if they have conscience and want the good of the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now leading the way for women to come and take the mantle of leadership in Abia. The time is now; I don\u2019t have anything against the men, it is just that they have done a bad job. You can\u2019t keep doing the same thing and expect a different result. It is time for a woman to lead Abia. Remember, women are the ones who take care of the home. Women ensure there is food on the table. Abia needs a woman to put the house in order like we do in our homes. When it comes to the Abia charter of equity, it has worked well for men. I\u2019m looking forward to the charter of equity to also recognize women and give them their rights. Abia has continued to have stability and fairness under the charter.\n\n\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t think it will be fair if we don\u2019t give women a chance to govern. Women are part of democracy. Let power rotate to women. If we want to rebuild Abia, women and youth have to step up. They should step up to run for positions. If we keep quiet, nothing will change.\u201d `\n\nOgwo, who is a former national handball player, disclosed that she has the capacity to turn things around and take the state to greater heights if elected governor.\n\n\u201cI have the contacts to partner with the State of Maryland and other states in America to help me develop Abia in terms of hospital equipment, education, among others. The people in the Diaspora are willing to come and assist rebuild the state. I\u2019m running under APGA, the other parties have failed us. APGA is an Igbo party.

          "text": ".\n\nSays he will identify young men and women of impeccable character, competence that have been accepted at the grassroots level to run for Offices and support their campaign\n\nTo think-outside-the-box and compliment government\u2019s existing efforts in the emancipation of women and youths in Nigeria\n\nTo initiate a Reward System that is sustainable where hard working and qualified party women and youths will be accorded first right of refusal\n\nBy Henry Umoru, ABUJA\n\nAHEAD of March 26 National Convention of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Chairman, Senate Services Committee, Senator Sani Musa, APC Niger East has unfolded his agenda for Nigerian Women and the Youths, saying if elected as the Chairman of the ruling party, he would think-outside-the-box and complement government\u2019s existing efforts geared towards the emancipation of women and youths in the country.\n\nMusa, a frontline aspirant for the position of National Chairman of APC, has also promised to institutionalize and make the party become what he described as a political party that will work its policies that will in all its ramifications, support the women and youths in both the internal working and developmental structures of the ruling party.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during an interactive session with a cross-section of women and youths under the aegis of APC Youths Stakeholders Forum, the Chairmanship aspirant said that one of his cardinal points would be to identify young men and women of impeccable character and competence who have been accepted at the grassroots level to run for offices and support their campaign.\n\nAccording to him, this action would help ensure that the best amongst them are given an opportunity to occupy leadership positions without the lack of encouragement and financial burden that comes with such, just as he also promised to adapt to a participatory work style that will usher visionary and pacesetting leadership for the party that will guarantee affirmative actions.\n\nEarlier in their remarks, the National Coordinators of APC Youths Stakeholders Forum, Dr Mariam Jibrin and Mr Uju Kelechi who articulated their views in support of the aspiration of Senator Musa for the position of National Chairman of the party, however, called for an all-inclusive party where women and youths will have strategic roles to play within the APC.\n\nSpeaking further, Senator Musa said \u201cIn recent times, women and youths in Nigeria have demonstrated a high level of commitment to service and an uncommon zeal as critical stakeholders in key governance issues and decision making.\n\n\u201cAs a frontline aspirant for the position of the National Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC), it is important to share with you my thoughts and plans for our women and youths if given the opportunity to lead our great party.\n\nSenator Musa while responding said \u201cI am fully aware of the challenges facing women and youths in Nigeria today, and the series of hurdles they have to cross in order to be heard and be given the opportunity to tap their potentials.\n\n\u201cOur agenda for women and youths as a party will be within the confines of the party\u2019s formulated policies that will be proposed to the executive arm of government. Of course, as the head of the party leadership or the National Working Committee (NWC), it is imperative for us to think outside the box and complement the government\u2019s existing effort in the emancipation of women and youths in our society.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are essential institutions of democracy and as such, I will be adaptive and committed to building capacity amongst our women and youths folks and we shall make it a policy of the party.\n\n\u201cJust as human capital development will be giving the most needed priority based on a model similar to the one implemented by the Best Practices Institute (BPI), under my leadership APC will work to deliver training to volunteers, Party leaders and staff, women and youth organizers, candidates and campaign staff, constituency caucus members, community stakeholders and leaders, and in so doing our operational foundations will become more solid.\n\n\u201cThis project will be one of our core programmes in building and strengthening the All Progressives Congress Party, APC structures from ward to national levels to ensure success for the party in both elections and governance.\n\n\u201cWe are firmly aware that women and youth are the least represented amongst the political leadership. Whilst commending President Muhammadu Buhari for signing into law the \u201cNot-too-young-to-run bill\u201d into law and other initiatives for youth and women participation in politics, as a party, one of our strategies is to close the funding gap.\n\n\u201cAs part of the reward system for APC under my leadership, we\u2019ll identify young men and women of impeccable character and competence who have been accepted at the grassroots level to run for offices and support their campaign. This will ensure that the best amongst us are given an opportunity to occupy leadership positions without the lack of encouragement and financial burden that comes with such.\n\n\u201cIf given the opportunity to lead the APC, I will explore and initiate a transfer of knowledge, a think-tank team or policy institute will be established as an organ in the party with the sole purpose of performing research and advocacy findings concerning developmental initiatives such as social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture.\n\n\u201cOur belief is that Political parties should not only be a vehicle for winning elections and go into oblivion until another round of campaign starts, we\u2019ll ensure that elected officials are given all the necessary support to succeed on their assignment.\n\n\u201cWith Senator Mohammed Sani Musa at the helms of affairs, imposition of candidates during primaries will be a thing of the past. We will give a level playing field to women of courage and ambitious youths to actualize their dreams.\n\n\u201cOur agenda is to unleash our real potentials by changing our decayed system, process and outcomes to that of modern society and state where things are better for its people.\n\nWomen and Youths will take the centre stage of our activities and as such, skill development will be on a mission mode, at an unprecedented scale in order to produce capable, confident and well skilled human resources that will feed an expanding economy.\n\n\u201cA Reward System that is sustainable will be initiated, hard-working and qualified party women and youths will be accorded first right of refusal where there are available opportunities. We\u2019ll work with party organs to ensure women & youths get decent jobs, political weight, negotiating muscle, and real influence in decision making. The women and youth wings of the party leadership will be empowered to contribute meaningfully to the development of society.\n\n\u201cInterests of the Youth & Women groups in the APC will be aggregated. We\u2019ll facilitate all-inclusive stakeholders retreat to review the state of affairs of the party, this will provide the opportunity for key stakeholders to articulate their views and make critical inputs. Challenges, lessons and recommendations learnt from it will form part of whatever working framework we will adopt as a party.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, my pledge to women and youths is that we will run an effective, all-inclusive and active transformational leadership that will ensure efficiency in our party administration so that everyone can have a voice and can directly benefit from our proposed developmental agenda.\n\n\u201cOnce again, together we can work towards these noble ideals and put our party and candidature in reality by supporting a new voice, new direction and fresh ideas that can move our party forward come March 26 and beyond.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Justice Binta Nyako must be firm in upholding justice without fear and favour otherwise she will ridicule herself amongst judicial colleagues both internally and within the International community.\n\n\u201cThis position is based on the fact that the 15 counts amended charges upon which his case is predicated are empty and has no iota of substance whatsoever. The emptiness of these laughable charges has been well marshalled out/comprehensively discussed in the 46-page objection filed by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s erudite legal team.\n\n\u201cMost importantly is the fact that you cannot build something on nothing and expect it to stand. No trial can be entertained in any court in Nigeria in so far as the abduction of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in KENYA and his extraordinary rendition to Nigeria is still a grave violation of international law, which crime Nigeria Government is still guilty of.\u201d\n\nPowerful maintained that the IPOB leader never committed any crime, stressing that the charges are frivolous.\n\nHe added: \u201cMazi Nnamdi KANU has never committed any crime and this position is very obvious going by the frivolous 15 count amended Charges which has nothing attached to it as evidence.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami completely agreed with the foregoing position in which his erudite and compelling Article was published in our penultimate press statement. You can\u2019t turn the law upside down and as such, no court in Nigeria has the jurisdictional competency to try Mazi Nnamdi KANU.\n\n\u201cWhat is expected to happen on 8th Day of April 2022, is total acquittal and discharge of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and nothing more.\u201d",

          "text": "The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ebonyi has slammed Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike for his outburst against Governor David Umahi\u2019s defection suit.\n\nThe APC on Sunday described the Rivers Governor\u2019s statement as reckless and an affront on the Judiciary.\n\nChairman of Ebonyi APC, Stanley Okoro-emegha stated this in a statement on Sunday.\n\nHe was reacting to media reports credited to Wike who was quoted as saying he was one of the forces behind the ruling of an Abuja High Court, which ordered for the sack of Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe from office for defecting to APC from the People\u2019s Democratic Party(PDP).\n\nThe APC Chairman advised Wike to leave Umahi alone and focus on solving the many problems bedeviling his State.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Ebonyi State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to the reckless outburst of the primitive Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike.\n\n\u201cThe Rivers State Governor was reacting to the very unjust and widely condemnable Federal High Court ruling which recently sacked Governor Umahi and his Deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe,\u201d he began.\n\nEmegha stated that \u2018after listening to Governor Wike\u2019s rcekless tirades against Governor Umahi, which is very characteristic of him,the Ebonyi APC feels obligated to reply the garrulous, highly pompous but poorly performing Governor of Rivers State, and to place him where he rightly belongs\u2019.\n\nThe Ebonyi APC Chairman claimed that there is no comparison between the \u2018widely rated performing Governor of Ebonyi State,David Umahi, and the \u2018power-drunk\u2019 Wike in any area\u2019.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi has clearly surpassed the sleeping Governor of Rivers state in all indexes of performance both in private life and in public service,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that it is a measure of the rot in our democracy that a Governor pp will have no qualms in publicly reprimanding and threatening to deal with a fellow Governor over an issue that is before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cIt speaks to the malaise in the Nigeria judiciary, and further lends credible credence to the insinuations that our judicial system are indeed being manipulated by some powerful forces against the ordinary Nigerians.\u201d\n\nWhile noting Umahi has since appealed the judgement of the Federal High Court Abuja, Emegha expressed hope that the appellate Courts will upturn the ruling of the lower court as it is not in consonance with any of the already established legal precedents on the issue of defection in the country.\n\n\u2018Having said that , Nigerians are however invited to note that the current travails of Governor David Umahi has nothing whatsoever to do with offending any law, but a clear case of political enemies persecuting a performing Governor because of his rising political profile as indicated by the utterances of Governor Wike.\n\n\u201cWike should know that it is God that lifts and not mortals like him. So, no amount of his evil plots will be portent enough as to be able to dislodge nor remove a serving Governor who was single-handedly installed by God Himself for a unique purpose for His people.\n\n\u201cWike and his co- travelers should go to hell and burn to ashes if they cannot accept the verdict of God which has clearly positioned Governor Umahi as the most qualified and preferred aspirant to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, and stop behaving like sadists who are hell-bent on equalizing misery.\u201d\n\nThe Ebonyi APC Chairman noted that the party and the people of Ebonyi State and indeed all lovers of democracy will continue to support and pray for Governor Umahi not only for the restoration of his mandate, but also for his victory as the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cIf not that Governor Umahi has warned us against attacking any leader or Governor on his behalf, I would have properly situated the despicable character in Rivers State Government House who now masquerade as a Governor.\n\n\u201cHowever Governor Wike is once again advised to focus his attention on solving the numerous developmental challenges bufetting his Rivers State, and stop dissipating energy sounding like the godfather of the Nigeria body-polity\u201d.\n\nUmahi defected to the APC from the PDP, the party on whose banner he won election twice as governor of Ebonyi state, in November 2020.\n\nBut the PDP instituted a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja urging the court to sack the governor and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe for the defection.\n\nIt argued that the votes belongs to the party and not the governor and his deputy.\n\nThe Court presided by Justice Inyang Ekwo agreed with the PDP and ordered the governor and deputy to vacate their seats immediately.\n\nIt also ordered Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue certificates of return to two nominees from the PDP to replace the Messrs Umahi and Igwe or to conduct another election for the two positions.\n\nThe PDP immediately nominated and forwarded the names of Iduma Igariwey, a House of Representatives member and Fred Udogu, a former State Chairman of the party as replacements for the two positions.\n\nUmahi, however rejected the ruling and headed to the appeal court irving the higher court to upturn the ruling.",

          "text": "By Agatha Emeadi\n\nChief Whip of the 9th Senate of the National Assembly, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu, has described as false and unfortunate claims by the former Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr Salihu Lukman, that he was one of those supporting the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mai Mala Buni, to scuttle the party\u2019s planned national convention. APC national convention is scheduled to hold on March 26.\n\nSenator Kalu who stated this yesterday in a statement he personally signed said:\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\n\u201cI have read the unfortunate accusations leveled against me by a former Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr Salihu Lukman.\n\n\u201cIn a statement credited to Lukman, he alleged that some party leaders are working with the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mai Mala Buni, to undermine the March 26 national convention of the party.\n\n\u201cHe specifically noted that \u2018there are other party leaders, including Sen. Uzor Kalu who have actively supported His Excellency, Mai Mala to undermine the decision to organise the national convention of the party.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe former Abia State governor said that he deemed it necessary to correct the wrong impressions Lukman wanted to create.\n\n\u201cThere has been no time I participated in any collaboration or collusion to ensure that attempts to organise the APC national convention are blocked,\u201d he said, recalling that on December 15, last year, he had made an appeal to the party and the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee members to consider postponing the party\u2019s national convention earlier slated for February.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe explained: \u201cI had warned that holding the convention in February without sorting out the minor disagreements that arose during the congress would lead to implosion.\n\n\u201cI was worried that the creation of factions which denied the party victory in so many states in the past elections may repeat itself. I, therefore, called for a peaceful resolution of the crisis before holding the convention. No peaceful and tactful leader would support a terrible scenario to reoccur.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that I have always stood for and supported the party and Gov. Mai Mala Buni only happened to be the chairman of the party. Aside serving as the chairman of the party, Buni is my old family friend and I cannot deny him because he is facing challenges today. We have been friends and family for the past 25 years.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Whip of the Senate stated that there was no doubt that Buni has done very well for the party, pointing out that his sterling leadership quality was what helped to \u201cstabilise our great party across the six geopolitical zones, with high profile defections in our favour.\u201d\n\nKalu, therefore, said: \u201cIn this time of challenge and misunderstandings, I am calling on the party leaders and stakeholders to guard their utterances to avoid creating more disharmony. Even in a nuclear family, disagreements and quarrels exist.\n\n\u201cThe APC is a very big party with several caucuses. We have the governors, National Assembly, businessmen, youths and women, among other caucuses. The directions and concerns of these caucuses should be taken into consideration at all times.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, whether it is Gov. Mai Mala Buni or Gov. Abubakar Sani Bello, I would always give the party my maximum support and drive for stronger growth. There is always a danger with single story and I encourage Mr. President to hear the two sides of the story so that the party can win together.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n* Says national convention still holds March 26\n\n*Bello, el-Rufai, Fayemi meet president in London\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appraised recent developments in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and warned the leaders and members of the party to desist forthwith from name-calling and backstabbing.\n\nRather, he said, the party must be ready to put its house in order ahead of the planned national convention of the party holding in Abuja on March 26, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe embattled Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\n\n\nAs Buni is being expected back to take over, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State governor, Mr. Abubakar Sani Bello; Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nThis is as the ruling party has clarified that the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nAs the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party await the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders of the party, they have also mounted pressure on Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the scheduled meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, tasked the leaders and membership of the APC to stop mudslinging ahead of the forthcoming national convention that will lead to the election of new national leaders to run the party for the next four years.\n\nHe also urged them to remain steadfast and maintain their unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\n\n\n\nThe president asked the APC members to look at the once-powerful, \u201cmain opposition\u201d Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\nHe warned that \u201dthey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\n\n\u201dBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari recalled that the APC started with a confidence of victory, adding that the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\n\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\n\nThis alone, in addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party, the president further noted, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari also stressed that for more than a week, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinise their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They incline only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nBello, el-Rufai, Fayemi Meet Buhari in London\n\nMeanwhile, the acting Chairman of the party and Niger State Governor, Bello; Kaduna State Governor, el-Rufai and their counterpart in Ekiti State, Fayemi, arrived London last night to meet with Buhari.\n\nA source in the ruling party said the visit was informed by \u201cthe urgent need to brief the president on events since the new Acting Chairman took over as well as bring him up to speed with the preparations for the March 17 NEC meeting and the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe team is also in London to check up on the President as he takes his deserved rest,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe source added that the governors\u2019 visit will put a final seal on all of APC\u2019s plans for the National Convention, especially its NEC meeting believed to be a major determinant of what would happen at the March 26 convention.\n\nBuni to Return This Week as Party Denies Sacking Akpanudoedehe\n\nIn a related development, Buni is expected back in the country on Monday to assume the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of Buni\u2019s aides informed THISDAY yesterday that as soon as the Yobe State governor returns to the country, he would take charge of the affairs of the party.\n\n\n\nThe aide, who pleaded anonymity, also stated that the acting Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Niger State, Bello is expected to vacate the seat for Buni to avoid dragging the party into any illegality.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe (Buni) is expected back on Monday and of course, with the position of INEC which made his position very clear and if you have read the dailies today, even the secretariat has backtracked and confirmed that he\u2019s still in charge.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs soon as he\u2019s back, obviously, the next thing is to take charge. I am sure the party or the acting chairman now will not want to drag the party into any unconstitutionality or any illegality.\u201d\n\nAlso, Buni\u2019s Director-General for Media and Publicity, Mr Mamman Mohmamed said the acting chairman had stated in unambiguous terms that he was in an acting capacity.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that whenever the substantive chairman comes back, the acting chairman would have to give way.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis is what we expect and this position is very clear by the regulatory body of political parties, which is the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC as an institution has said that as far as it is concerned, Governor Buni remains the chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure nobody will want to act in another illegality. So, he is coming back and I am sure the acting chairman will vacate his seat for the substantive chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nAsked if Buni will go ahead with the NEC meeting slated for Thursday, Mohammed said it would be part of the issues that would be considered when Buni is back.\n\nThe ruling party has also clarified that Akpanudoedehe did not resign his position, and was not sacked by the party.\n\n\n\nThere was confusion at the national secretariat of the party last Tuesday over the fate of Akpanudoedehe.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he had insisted that he was still the secretary except the President said otherwise.\n\nHowever, the APC Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu Dambatta in a statement issued yesterday said the National Secretary never sent any resignation letter.\n\n\n\nDambatta stated: \u201cFurther to the media conference earlier held by the Spokesman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, the party wishes to note that the Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, never sent a resignation letter to the party to the best of its knowledge and neither was he sacked as some social media blogs speculated. All those are utterly false.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe APC is one family, the Caretaker is one unit. We have an Acting Chairman who is racing against time to deliver a convention and committee members that are united in supporting him in carrying out that onerous mandate,\u201d Dambatta explained.\n\n\n\nHe called on the public to disregard social media stories that are not rooted in fact or even sound reasoning.\n\nTHISDAY checks however revealed that the twist in APC\u2019s narration may not be unconnected with the firm stand of the INEC not to recognise the Niger State Governor, Bello as the acting Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBello, who assumed the leadership of the party last Monday had written the electoral body notifying the commission of the party\u2019s decision to convene for an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting.\n\nThe ruling party had scheduled its NEC meeting for Thursday, March 17, 2022, where it is believed that the leadership quagmire would be resolved.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that Bello, upon resumption as acting Caretaker Chairman transmitted a letter dated March 8, 2022, informing INEC of the change of guard at the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\n\n\nHowever, INEC in a letter signed by the Secretary to the commission, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony and dated March 9, 2022, said the party must give it 21 days\u2019 notice and that the letter was not signed by the party\u2019s Chairman and Secretary.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that INEC\u2019s response forced the party\u2019s stakeholders to bring Buni back to ensure that the emergency NEC meeting and the national convention of the party are held as scheduled.\n\nIn a related development, the governors elected on the platform of the ruling party are said to be waiting for the outcome of the meeting between Buhari and some stakeholders as part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the leadership crisis in the party.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami was in London, while Buni also flew to London from Dubai to be part of the meeting.\n\n\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cMalami is in London. His mission is two-fold: one, to let Buhari know of the outcome of the Senate rejection of the amendment of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act; two, to report on issues going on in the party. Buni was also in London but is expected back today or tomorrow\u201d\n\nInvestigations showed that the NEC meeting of APC will go on as INEC has no power over the internal control of the parties.\n\n\n\nAnother party source told THISDAY that the Secretary, Senator Akpanudoedehe and the acting Caretaker Chairman and the Governor of Niger State, Bello met with one of the founding fathers of the party on Friday in Abuja.\n\nAt the meeting, it was gathered that the party chieftain urged Akpanudoedehe to sign the notice of the NEC meeting.\n\n\n\nThe source said some APC governors are also talking to the secretary to see the need to sign the notice and save the party from destruction.\n\nThe source noted that all efforts are to ensure that the convention date of the party is not postponed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Anxiety as PDP National Caucus, NEC Meet Over Presidential Ticket",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is anxiety among members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the national caucus of the main opposition party and the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meet on Monday (tomorrow) and Tuesday to take a decision on the presidential ticket of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nIn a memo to its national caucus, the main opposition party has directed members of the caucus to consider whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe party also urged its national caucus to determine the implications of throwing the presidential ticket open.\n\nWith the election of its National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu from the North, it was expected that the party\u2019s presidential candidate would emerge from the South.\n\n\n\nBut the main opposition party has been playing hide-and-seek games with the issue of where its presidential candidate would come from, raising concerns that it might throw the ticket open, against the popular agitation for power to shift to the South.\n\n\n\nUnlike the PDP, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has set the necessary machinery in motion to choose its presidential candidate from the South.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the two organs of the PDP will decide whether to zone or throw open the presidential ticket of the party for the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nPDP NEC will also decide on the recommendation of the 2019 Elections Review Committee set up by the party to assess its performance in the last general election.\n\n\n\nThe committee headed by the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed had in its recommendation submitted to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party on May 21, 2021, urged the party to allow interested party members to vie for the 2023 presidency, irrespective of their geopolitical zones.\n\n\n\nThe committee had anchored its position on the fact that across the land, Nigeria boasts of good hands capable of bailing the country \u201cout of her current quagmire.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe report of the committee had stated that: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North-east and South-east geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency, should be given special consideration, in choosing the presidential flagbearer of the party, for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country.

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Nigeria ramps up output to 1.51m bpd\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to raise crude oil production by 340,000 barrels per day last month, the gap between the group\u2019s actual output and target still widened to 890,000 bpd, according to the cartel\u2019s report.\n\n\n\nIt was also a month that saw Nigeria raise output to 1.51 million bpd, a marked improvement from the previous few months when the country struggled to produce between 1.2 million bpd and 1.4 bpd.\n\n\n\nNigeria has been constrained in meeting its OPEC allocation for months, and as of January had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.\n\n\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by OPEC+, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nAlthough there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country\u2019s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nThe latest report showed that production from OPEC+ participants was 38.25 million bpd in February, up from 37.91 million bpd in January, but below the target of 39.14 million, according to an Argus survey, which shares insights and analyses about energy and commodity markets worldwide.\n\n\n\nBut oil prices rose at the weekend, although they experienced their biggest weekly declines since November on fears of escalating bans on Russian oil as against efforts to bring more supply to the market from other major producers.\n\n\n\nIn a week of volatile trading marked by talk of Russian oil embargoes then potential supply additions from Iran, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates while fighting escalated in Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark fell 5.2 per cent after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13 on Monday.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, US crude was dropped 6.6 per cent after touching a high of $130.50 at the start of the trading week.\n\nA day earlier, crude oil prices fell significantly, tumbling from a 2008 high of $130, about the largest single-day percentage decline since April 2020.\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s benchmark oil dropped 13 per cent to $111 a barrel, while the WTI crude oil which topped $130 at the height of trading earlier in the week, lost 12 per cent.\n\n\n\nThe latest report indicated that notably, the quota-exempt OPEC members, Iran and Libya raised output by a combined 170,000 bpd in February, with the north African country accounting for 130,000 bpd of this after an early-January restart of four crude and condensate fields.\n\n\n\nBut 14 of the wider group\u2019s 19 members, including Nigeria, produced below quota in the month, as dwindling spare capacity, underinvestment and infrastructure restraints have constrained output increases.\n\n\n\nThe OPEC+ group\u2019s stance on rising prices is that they are down to geopolitics and not market fundamentals, with the organisation\u2019s Secretary-General, Mr Sanusi Barkindo, saying during the week that \u201cwe have no control over current events.\u201d\n\n\n\nBarkindo stated that despite the surging crude oil prices, there\u2019s no shortage of the commodity in the market, although he admitted that not all member countries are currently able to fulfil their obligations because of capacity constraints.\n\n\n\nOPEC+ ministers will meet on March 31, to decide a production strategy for May, when five countries \u2014 Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE \u2014 will see upwards revisions to the baseline levels that determine their quotas and compliance.\n\n\n\nThis would see the combined monthly output quota increase move to 432,000 bpd from 400,000 bpd, which could go some way to satisfying calls for the group to raise the pace of production increases.\n\n\n\nMinister of State Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, last week said that the absence of long-term investment in the oil and gas sector, as well as insecurity, should be blamed on Nigeria\u2019s current low crude oil production.\n\n\n\nSylva stated that this development was responsible for the inability of Nigeria to meet the OPEC quota in recent times in addition to the speed with which International Oil Companies (IOCs) and other investors were withdrawing investments in hydrocarbon exploitation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Under these conditions, it was easy for prejudice and fear to thrive.\n\n\u201cNation-building is about building a common sense of purpose, sense of shared destiny and collective imagination of belonging.\n\n\n\n\u201cNation-building is about building the tangible and intangible threads that hold a political entity together and give it a sense of purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said that the nation\u2019s founding fathers tried to deal with the challenge by adopting federalism and advocating a policy of unity-in-diversity.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the lack of consolidation of Nigerian federalism around commonly shared values and positions continues to undermine our efforts at nation-building.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis could be seen in the division between \u2018indigenes\u2019 and \u2018settlers\u2019, which has been a source of domestic tension and undermined our efforts at creating a common nationhood,\u201d Ganduje said.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to see themselves as victims of their history, but be more responsible to overcome the challenges posed by their history.\n\n\n\nGanduje said leadership was a critical factor in nation-building, adding that it has to do with personal qualities of integrity, honesty, commitment and competence of individual leaders.\n\n\n\n\u201cLeadership is a critical factor in nation-building that has to do with personal qualities of integrity, honesty, commitment, and competence of individual leaders at the top.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd the collective qualities of common vision, focus and desire for the development of the elites as a whole,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\n\nHe said that was the reason why the nation must have a leadership that is committed to the rule of law, has a demonstrable sense of fair play and democratic tolerance.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother important aspect of nation-building is the building of common citizenship.\n\n\u201cA common nationhood cannot be achieved while citizens are living such parallel lives.\n\nNations are built by healthy and skilled citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn grounds of both equity and efficiency, we need to promote the access of the bulk of the Nigerian population to basic education, health, and housing,\u201d Ganduje said.\n\n\n\nThe governor added that Nigeria needs a social contract with its citizens as a basis for demanding loyalty and support.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a social contract with its citizens as a basis for demanding their loyalty and support.\n\n\u201cLeaders must raise governance standards by cultivating the culture of good governance,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event was attended by the university Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kayode Adebowale, Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado-Bayero, Sen.

          "text": "\n\n*Say bill conflicts with regulatory powers of existing agencies\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nLegal experts in Nigeria who attended the two days stakeholders\u2019 forum on National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Bill 2021 in Lagos, which ended at the weekend, have picked holes in the new propositions contained in the proposed bill, which is a Repeal and Re-Enactment Bill 2021.\n\n\n\nThe legal practitioners described the bill as infiltrating and an attempt to unnecessarily duplicate the regulatory powers of some existing government agencies in the country.\n\n\n\nThey made their positions known during a webinar session on \u2018Stakeholders\u2019 Engagement for Legal Practitioners in Nigeria on National Information Technology Development Agency Bill, 2021.\n\n\n\nThis followed an earlier stakeholders\u2019 engagement meeting held by NITDA in Abuja to consider the proposed NITDA Bill 2021 which, among other things, was aimed at changing NITDA from an IT Development Agency, to a regulator of the information technology industry ecosystem.\n\n\n\nThe webinar, which was put together by the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Committee of the Nigeria Bar Association Section on Business Law (NBA-SBL), in collaboration with the NITDA and Farisad Investment Limited (FIL), was attended by stakeholders within the legal ecosystem, who reviewed the new provisions in the proposed Bill.\n\n\n\nDuring the webinar anchored by the Chief Executive Officer of FIL, Sanusi Musa, the NBA President, Mr Olumide Akpata, after his brief remarks, raised three fundamental concerns on the proposed bill, which, he said, should be looked into by stakeholders at the webinar. Akpata was represented by the ICT Committee Chairman for NBA-SBL, Mr Rotimi Ogunyemi.\n\n\n\nThe tripartite concerns raised by Akpata, were around how the bill will align with the Startup Bill before the National Assembly; how the NITDA Bill intends to navigate its way within the broadband context of other regulatory functions; and what will be the implications of the penalties for violation of certain sections of the bill on the ICT business environment.\n\n\n\nOther legal experts spoke on other areas of conflict of the proposed NITDA Bill with existing legations of some other organisations, including the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Computer Professional Registration Council of Nigeria (CPN), Federal Completion and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unity (NFIU), Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), among others.\n\n\n\nEach of the Acts establishing all these existing agencies was looked into vis-\u00e0-vis the new provisions in the NITDA Bill and it was unanimously agreed by the legal stakeholders that there were regulatory conflicts that may be detrimental to the peaceful regulatory atmosphere being experienced in the nation\u2019s digital economy space.\n\n\n\nAside from some of the provisions overlapping on the regulatory functions of other agencies, the legal experts observed that a number of the provisions in the bill are ambiguous, unclear and capable of exerting substantial regulatory conflict in the system.\n\n\n\nThe legal practitioners called on those that drafted the NITDA Bill 2021 to go back and review it and ensure that they address all the areas of regulatory conflict with existing regulatory powers and functions of other agencies. Some of the stakeholders also called for an outright expunging of the conflicting sections from the bill, stating, however, that if NITDA wishes to collaborate with other agencies in some critical areas of regulations, it is better to simply \u201cresort to signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with other concerned agencies instead of interloping into their regulatory roles.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe stakeholders further stated that NITDA was supposed to be an ICT policy development and implementation agency and should not unnecessarily arrogate regulatory powers to itself, which are already being exercised by other agencies.\n\n\n\nJustifying the need for the review of the NITDA Act, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by his Technical Adviser, Prof. Saliu Junaidu, said the NITDA Act 2007 is one of the laws that require a repeal and re-enactment to keep it in tune with the developmental regulation direction of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2020-2030.\n\n\n\nAlso justifying the need for the bill, Director-General of NITDA, Kashifu Abdullahi, said the scope of ICT has widened over the years with a lot of convergence and expansion in technology platforms being used by businesses and governments for delivery services. \u201cConsidering that NITDA Act is almost 16 years old, we consider it necessary to keep the Act up-to-date with the current reality in the Nigerian digital economy space,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\n\n\nWhile providing information on the new provisions in the proposed NITDA Act 2021, Director, Legal Service Department at NITDA, Emmanuel Edet, said: \u201cWe know that some of the areas we would like to be regulating fall into the existing regulatory functions of some agencies, which informed why NITDA\u2019s emphasis would be on collaboration.\u201d\n\n\n\nResponding to a question raised on over-regulating the ICT ecosystem, Edet said: \u201cIt is better to over-regulate than to under-regulate. NITDA\u2019s vision is to evolve into a development/regulatory agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said while the major challenge identified so far by stakeholders has been the issue of regulatory overlap, NITDA would take a look at this and also put all the observations, comments and inputs by stakeholders into consideration, for further work on the proposed bill.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has revealed Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja as the judge he uses for \u2018dirty jobs\u2019.\n\nWike had during the inauguration of the reconstructed 3.4km eastern bypass in Port Harcourt said he was behind the sacking of David Umahi as governor of Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cYou carry the vote of another party and join another party. Can you transfer votes? If you are defecting, leave the seat. And this will checkmate most of these political harlots who will never sit in one place, looking for excuses here and there.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take our property and say we should close our mouths. How can we close our mouths? And say those who are behind it. We are behind it.\n\n\u201cIf your friends don\u2019t want to tell you, me, I\u2019m involved. So, nobody should threaten us.

The monies were withdrawn and utilised by the aforementioned account holders and the lady.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the above response has not linked the suspect, DCP Abba Kyari, to the offence of money laundering as the evidence contained in the case diary is not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin, more so that the aforementioned recipients or receivers exonerated him in their statements as having nothing to do with the monies.\u201d\n\nThe justice minister said the police might wish to explore their internal disciplinary measures against Kyari through the Police Service Commission for breaching the code of conduct for law enforcement officers by hobnobbing with suspected fraudsters and people of questionable means in his capacity as a senior officer and head of the IRT.\n\nMalami also said Kyari could be sanctioned for violating the social media policy of the police by responding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s indictment on Facebook; breaching the Police Code of Professional Ethics by accepting complaints and acting on such without recourse to established protocol and detaining a suspect, Vincent Chibuzor, for over a month without a valid court order and regards to his fundamental human rights.",

          "title": "Nigerian government shuts down 6 illegal digital loan companies",
          "text": "On Friday, 3 Nigerian federal government agencies\u2014Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Related Offences Commission (ICPC)\u2014collaborated with the Nigerian police force to raid some illegal financial institutions operating from their Opebi Road offices in Ikeja, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Punch, digital lending platforms like GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Easi Moni, KashKash, and Speedy Choice were among the busted companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe FCCPC, which led the joint operation, said the raid was a response to several customers\u2019 complaints about the malpractices carried out by financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking at the raid, the CEO at FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the agency started investigating and monitoring these companies in 2020 when consumers started accusing them of mishandling and violating their private data in the process of loan recovery.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. When the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise of money lenders,\u201d Irukera said. \u201cBecause of the lockdown, people needed small and instant loans to sustain, which is understandable. But, over a period of time, people started to complain about the malpractice of the lenders so we started tracking it.\u201d\n\nIrukera also mentioned that, towards the end of last year, the agency had gathered a lot of information and started working with some other key agencies to monitor these businesses.\n\nAccording to Irukera, their findings so far are: the interest rate charged by these digital lenders appears to violate the ethics of how lending is done; secondly, the unethical loan recovery practice of violating customers\u2019 privacy to abuse and shame them and their acquaintances.\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms, which has been very difficult. These companies move around a lot, and it took us several months visiting each of their locations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FCCPC boss, however, said investigations also revealed that the loan firms weren\u2019t Nigerian nor registered in the country, they don\u2019t have an address nor do they have a licence to do business in Nigeria. He also said that most of these companies operated from the same place and by the same person.\n\nWith no address, all these companies have are mobile apps that can be downloaded on both Google and Apple Stores. So the agency had to engage the people who have been their victims and gather more evidence.\n\nBy now, all the agencies involved had gotten enough information and evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for them to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure.\n\n\u201cAnd sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation, which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we were hitting at the place where we could get many of them,\u201d said the FCCPC boss.\n\nHe also mentioned that the agency had issued an order to Apple and Google to take down these companies\u2019 apps from their platforms. It has also ordered the banks to freeze these companies\u2019 bank accounts.\n\nLast year, when NITDA sanctioned Sokoloan, TechCabal reported that that would be the first of many. Though it took longer than expected, it\u2019s finally happening.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones\u2014no. We want to start with them. We also understand that there are between 5 and 7 companies operating at the same location,\u201d said Irukera, hinting at the agency\u2019s ambition to cleanse the nation of all illegal digital lending practices.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cHoly f*ck.\u201d\n\nThat was what Beeple tweeted when \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d, his non-fungible Token (NFT) art and the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house, was bought for $69 million at Christie\u2019s in March last year. This event didn\u2019t only make Beeple the third richest artist in the world, it ushered in the beginning of a new era for the art world.\n\nWhile Beeple\u2019s was the most expensive JPEG NFT format, profile-pic NFT (PPF)\u2014NFTs that depict a portrait that can be used as a social media avatar\u2014also hit some record-breaking milestones. For example, Crypto Punk NFTs that were given out for free in 2017 at launch started trading for prices between $480,000 and $1.25 million in January 2021 and, by the end of the year, they wouldn\u2019t go for anything less than $4 million.\n\nThough NFT has been around since 2014, 2021 was the pivotal year for this \u201cnovelty and strange\u201d technology. It was the year it broke into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and waltzing its way into the hearts of almost every aspect of pop culture, from music to film to sports and literature.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile all of this was happening, a crop of young and curious African minds have also started to develop an appetite and build an NFT ecosystem on the continent. Although it felt\u2014still feels\u2014like a myth to the broader population, more people had started buying into it. Jacon Osinachi was well on his way to becoming the foremost NFT artist on the continent and, arguably, the world. Anthony Azekwoh would soon create and sell his first NFT \u201cThe Red Man\u201d, one of the most popular NFT pieces out of Africa. Zimbabwean Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, a digital art of late African-American entertainment and sports stars\u2014DMX, Kobe Bryant, Aaliyah, Chadwick Boseman, Tupac Shakur, and Nipsey Hussle\u2014would soon be picked up and displayed on a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nSomewhere in Abuja, Nigeria, is Peace Ojemeh 24, a Nigerian product designer and an Open Source advocate, who, like everybody else, is trying to understand the \u201cinsanity\u201d around this technology, the reason anybody would spend millions of dollars on something intangible\u2014something they might never touch physically.\n\nWhile Ojemeh was still making sense of this, the original copy of \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d, a viral photo meme of a girl smirking as a fire roared behind her, sold for $500,000 (180 ETH at the time).\n\n\u201cReading about Disaster girl, a meme I casually use in my WhatsApp chats with friends, selling for such a ridiculous amount of dollars, was an awakening. I just knew I had to get in on NFTs,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nBut judging from Ojemeh\u2019s journey, this could have been all talk. That wasn\u2019t the first time Ojemeh would get excited about crypto and its related ventures. In 2017 and 2018, she had planned to buy her first ethereum (ETH) but ended up not going through with it.\n\nWhen she finally did something in the space, it was a disaster. She bought edcoin, a crypto token from a Nigerian blockchain company Edmark. She even convinced her mother and uncle to invest in it but a few months after, while ETH ballooned into over $1,000, Edcoin started dropping in value.\n\nBy 2020, it was obvious edcoin wasn\u2019t going anywhere so she began to think of how to flip this seemingly bad investment into a lucrative one. She withdrew her investment from edcoin into ETH and then into e-gold and some other coins that yielded positives. This experience exposed her to the slippery world of crypto and the learnings from it shaped how she approaches crypto today.\n\nFounding Haze Monkey Society\n\nSo instead of going right into NFTs after the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d news, Ojemeh decided to learn about the industry, and invested in some NFTs to have access to their communities to understand how they function and are being managed. By the time she gathered enough knowledge, she reached out to her friend Alabo Briggs, 22, a blockchain engineer, about building their own NFT collection. Briggs was on board with the idea and advised that they mint a few NFTs before launching a collection. But Ojemeh\u2019s ambition was bigger than that; she wanted to build a strong NFTs community like Crypto Punk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had built, and she wanted to hit the ground running.\n\nSo she convinced Briggs and in August, while Pablo Stanley, one of the world\u2019s most popular and respected product designers and doodlers, was launching Robotos, a 10,000-robot NFT collection, and selling out, Ojemeh and Briggs were building their collection of stoned monkeys they would call Haze Monkey Society.\n\nHaze Monkey Society was launched as a collection of 4,200 NFTs focused on building a no-code platform aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists and making an environmental impact in Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, we needed to associate ourselves with a successful project while not being a complete replica. So with the success of BAYC, we chose to identify as monkeys,\u201d said Ojemeh. \u201cHaze indicates the weed-smoking culture among creatives. It\u2019s also an inspiration behind our unique number: 420.\u201d\n\nHaze Monkey has unique and rich storytelling built into each of its NFTs.\n\nA thoughtful roadmap\n\nOne of the things that determines the success of an NFT project is its community. And what makes a community thrive is the utilities, the benefits, that come from holding such NFT. Ojemeh and Briggs know this, and that\u2019s why they spent a lot of time deliberating on their roadmap.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just sell NFTs, we are keen on finding a way to provide value to Haze Monkey\u2019s holders,\u201d said Ojemeh, who also consults for the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the African Union on a project that exposes technology as a career path to girls across African countries.\n\nBesides access to an exclusive social community, there are 3 major benefits on Haze Monkey\u2019s roadmap. One of them is the no-code platform which Ojemeh said was born out of creating an environment where people don\u2019t need deep tech knowledge to harness the blockchain technology.\n\nThe next one is the animation series about Haze Monkey\u2019s unique stories where holders and community members will be characters. Lastly, the duo, having been born and bred in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where petroleum exploration in the area continues to pollute their water and atmosphere, decided to include something personal to them: they want to plant 100 trees somewhere in Africa for every single NFT minted.\n\nA learning curve that led to a new direction\n\nAbout 10 days before Haze Monkey NFTs would start its public minting in February, the team launched a countdown campaign and daily Twitter space discussion, where the community would come together, ask questions, calculate the societal impact of the project and, most importantly, the fortune it promises.\n\nThe minting calendar had been set; the public minting price was set at 0.08 ETH at a maximum of 4 NFTs per address and the presale price for those who had been whitelisted after performing some tasks or winning giveaways was pegged at 0.06 ETH at a maximum of 2 NFTs.\n\nIn one of those Twitter Spaces, a community member with a monkey avatar and a Mexican accent asked what would happen if the collection did not sell out within the opening week. For a few seconds, there was silence and one could tell he\u2019d ask an unexpected question. It was obvious the team hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan is to sell out, but in a situation where we don\u2019t the community will decide what to do,\u201d answered Ashlei, one of the US-based community managers who was moderating the space.\n\nBefore the countdown campaign started, Haze Monkey had gathered over 5,000 organic social followers and over 6,000 Discord community members from across the globe. The project had also been listed and verified on 7 of the largest NFT platforms\u2014NFT Calendar, NFT Drop, NFT Evening, Coin Market Cap, Rarity, Next Drop, NFT Genie, and Rarity Sniper.\n\nWith this increasing traction at zero marketing budget, the possibility of not selling out was out of the question. But Haze Monkey did about 20%. Among other factors, this could be attributed to the recent scare of stolen NFTs issues on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace in the world.\n\nHowever, the slow movement couldn\u2019t deter the team as they\u2019ve quickly started looking for new strategies. They are currently iterating their roadmap to suite the new reality and as a result, the community decided to reduce the amount of of Haze Monkey in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs a request from the community, our genesis collection was cut down to 1,242 with a vision of releasing the rest over time,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nShe also mentioned that the community had initially agreed to cap volume at 1, 000, but because of how significant 420 is to the project and its weed-cultured monkeys, the number 1,242 was chosen.\n\nHaze Monkey is now a collection of 1,242 NFTs.\n\nThough built by Africans in Africa, Haze Monkey has already positioned itself as a global brand. In its Discord group, the project has about 5 different channels for people who can\u2019t speak English. Its team members are also from across the world.\n\nThough there are African women in the NFT scene minting and selling their own NFT, there\u2019s none building a collection of NFT at the scale that Ojemeh and her team are doing.\n\nOjemeh believes that as they continue to build on the genesis collection and iterate their roadmap to benefit their community, there\u2019s nothing stopping Haze Monkey from becoming one of the most valuable NFTs in the $80 billion industry \u2014 and that their \u201choly f*ck\u201d moment will soon come.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Over the past month, at least 2 of Nigeria\u2019s largest commercial banks have announced reduced limits on international transactions using naira debit cards to $20 (around \u20a610,000) per month.\n\nThis comes as a longstanding scarcity of foreign exchange continues to bite Africa\u2019s largest economy and biggest oil exporter, despite the recent surge in global energy prices.\n\nNigerians can use their naira-denominated debit cards to pay for transactions billed in US dollars online. For every purchase, debits are made directly from their naira accounts at current exchange rates.\n\nBefore now, customers could spend up to $100 (\u20a650,000) on web transactions using their naira cards but that limit has been cut by Zenith Bank PLC and United Bank for Africa (UBA), per emails sent to customers and seen by TechCabal\n\n\u201cThe monthly card international spend limit for web transactions has been reviewed from $100 to $20,\u201d Zenith said, adding that the review is \u201cin response to today\u2019s economic realities.\u201d\n\nThat statement came about two weeks after UBA told its customers the same in February, with the reviewed naira card limits for international transactions taking effect March 1.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe banks have also suspended the use of naira cards for international Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and POS transactions, meaning cardholders cannot perform cash withdrawals and payments via those channels outside the country.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher International spend requirements, simply visit any of our branches and request for a foreign currency debit or prepaid card, which are available in US Dollar, Pounds, and Euro variants,\u201d Zenith Bank added.\n\n\u201cRemember you can use your UBA Dollar, Pounds or Euro Card for international POS, ATM, and web transactions,\u201d UBA\u2019s mail read. \u201cIf you do not have one and would like to subscribe, please visit a branch close to you.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nigerians have reacted with displeasure on social media against the new limits as they restrict their ability to pay for international transactions like Netflix subscriptions, ads on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.\n\n$20/month spending limit on @UBAGroup cards???

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRecently, my mental health has taken some heavy hits, and this week has been extremely stressful for me. Enough about me, though. What comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cmental health\u201d? A mad person?\n\nSide bar: It\u2019s encouraging to see how people are coming forward to test for mental illnesses and accept treatment. While this is still a long way off in Africa, it\u2019s certain we\u2019re getting there. So, thanks to the Internet for bringing it to light!\n\nBack to the matter. Is mental health only related to mental illnesses? Is it limited to schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, eating disorder, depression, insomnia, alcohol and substance abuse, and other similar conditions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s your answer: Mental health encompasses more than just mental illnesses. It is related to how a person feels, thinks, and acts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as a state of well-being in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community.\n\nThis means that someone may have good mental health, no mental illness or be somewhere in between. This refers to the mental health spectrum.\n\nFor instance, Ayo, a 27-year-old graduate, may not exhibit any signs of mental illness but is unemployed, with a negative attitude toward himself and his relationships, or may not have a strong sense of purpose. Can you say Ayo is mentally healthy? Of course not!\n\nHaving good mental health and no mental illness is at the top of the spectrum, while having poor mental health and a mental illness is at the bottom. While the people who are somewhere in the middle may have good mental health but a mental illness, they may also have poor mental health but no mental illness.\n\nConsequently, we must all strive to be at the top of the mental health spectrum which begins with prioritising your mental health as much as you do your physical and sexual health.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) 1999 guarantees Nigerian citizens the fundamental right to privacy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that under Section 37 of the CFRN, citizens have the right to privacy in their homes, correspondence, phone conversations, and telegraphic communications.\n\nThe Constitution, however, does not define \u201cprivacy\u201d or contain detailed privacy provisions. So, it is unclear how far Nigerian codified law protects data privacy.\n\nBut, personal data is becoming increasingly valuable, and it is constantly sought after by nefarious individuals who intend to exploit it to the detriment of the data subjects.\n\nThe current state of our laws demonstrates the need for Nigeria to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for data protection, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThis, among other reasons, could be why the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB), to focus on data protection and privacy in the country.\n\nOgheneruemu, a non-practising lawyer and Techpoint Africa Reporter, provided us with additional information about this new data protection enforcing body. What effect will this new agency have on your privacy rights?\n\nCheck it out here: Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntler East Africa, a venture capital firm based in Nairobi, has closed a $13.5 million fund to invest in early-stage tech startups in an oversubscribed round.\n\nInitially, the VC intended to raise $10 million but ended up with $13.5 million. Do the math: they received an additional $3.5 million.\n\nThe round\u2019s limited partners include Baillie Gifford, Canica, and other institutional investors like the International Finance Corporation.\n\nAntler East Africa launched in August 2019, two years after Antler \u2013 its parent company \u2013 was founded by Magnus Grimeland. Every year, the VC firm employs a full venture building model with two cohorts.\n\nThe company uses a hybrid model acting as both a venture builder and a venture capital firm. From its $300 million fund, the firm has invested in over 250 companies ranging from pre-seed to Series C.\n\nSo far, five cohorts of 153 founders have graduated from the accelerator programs, and the firm has made 14 investments. AIfluence, Marketforce-subsidiary Digiduka, Honeycoin, Uncover Skincare, Try Cooked, and Vybe are some examples.\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s new fund will allow it to invest in founders who want to build their startups from the ground up and already formed teams that require capital to scale.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nUnderstanding others\u2019 feelings: what is empathy and why do we need it?.

          "title": "Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups.

The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "text": "The adoption of Boniface Aniebonam\u2019s New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) by some political heavyweights is set to change the narrative in 2023.\n\nUnlike in 2019 presidential election when the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) called the shots with smaller parties making little or no impact, 2023 may be different with the determination of a Third Force, peopled by some political juggernauts led by former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso.\n\nInitially, 3rd Force had been dismissed by many Nigerians as posing no threat to the two established parties, particularly when the window for the registration of a new political party has been closed.\n\nKwankwaso and his group have entered into a working relationship with an existing party, the NNPP, a platform they said they hope to use to \u201csave democracy, rescue Nigeria from APC and PDP.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with Rufa\u2019i Ahmed Alkali, professor of political economy, and one of the key promoters of the Third Force, he said the Nigerian people had suffered so much in the hands of the two major parties, but that the Movement was going to change the narrative in 2023.\n\nThe Third Force under the name, The National Movement (TNM), a new political association, was launched in Abuja recently.\n\nIn the exclusive interview, Prof. Alkali said: \u201cWell back last year, before the summer of 2021, a couple of friends, very much associated with Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano State, decided to sit down to review the state of the nation, to review the state of the parties in the country. And we asked ourselves what was happening then, where is the country headed? We felt that history will never forgive us if all of us sit down in the comfort zone of our homes, watching television, condemning, and agonising, passing blame games.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo, we started thinking and talking. It reached a point to take a strong decision that no, we should go beyond initial phase of merely being friends to transforming it to a National Movement. We even drafted a Constitution, we have our logo; we have our motto and everything.\n\nOur own position is that, there cannot be peace in this country without justice, there cannot be peace where there is exclusion, there cannot be peace where the vast section of the society is alienated; women, youths, rural population, especially farmers, even cattle rearers. They are human beings. They are Nigerians, fishermen, artisans, name it. So it is necessary that we must do everything to save this democracy and rescue our country. That is the background.\u201d\n\nAlthough no party has so far declared its presidential flag bearer, BusinessDay gathered that Kwankwaso was eying the slot of NNPP and was good to clinch it.\n\nAt the launch of the National Movement, the former governor said: \u201cNigeria shall be a land of justice, freedom and equal opportunities where all citizens shall aspire to achieve their lifetime goals and ambitions, to live in peace, prosperity, and happiness.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday is a special day in the history of Nigeria, a special day in the life of our great nation and a special day for all those of us who are desirous of working together collectively to redeem our nation.\n\n\u201cFor too long, Nigerians have been waiting for this moment. For too long, Nigerians have been asking for a way out of our current severe economic and political predicament. For too long Friends of Nigeria both at home and abroad have been looking forward to the day Nigeria shall rise again.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to say, the place is here and the time is today and now. Today, 22 02 2022, being both an ambigram and a palindrome, is consciously chosen as a historic day on which we the people of Nigeria, cutting across all social, political, religious and ethnic backgrounds and affiliations, are assembled here to launch this extraordinary National Movement.\u201d\n\nAgbo Gilbert Major, outgoing NNPP National Secretary had recently said the party was in talks with the former governor of Kano State over his possible defection to the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nMajor said in a matter of days, the two-time Kano State governor would join the party alongside his allies.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians are getting set for the general election and we are meeting to reposition the party, and the frontiers are opening, a lot of Nigerians are coming in and there is need for us to adjust and accommodate the interests that are coming in.\n\n\u201cThese are the very crucial decisions that we are about to take and it is going to midwife a national convention which will hold within the next 30 days. We have read Nigerians speculating; the only thing I can tell you is that we are in deep talks with Kwankwaso; in fact, we have almost concluded, in the next few days, we will be reverting to Nigerians to tell them what understanding we have had with him (Kwankwaso), but I can assure you that he is on his way into NNPP,\u201d he said.\n\nKwankwaso\u2019s plan to dump the PDP is already sending disturbing signals to the party as its Ward Leaders in Rano Local Government Area of Kano State have resigned to join the former governor in defecting from the PDP.\n\nYusuf Bala-Usman, leader of \u2018Kwankwaso Kafarka Kafarmu\u2019 (Kwankwaso loyalists in Rano) who spoke on behalf of the group, said they left the PDP over injustice meted to members of the party in the North-west region.\n\nBala-Usman said in his own resignation letter that: \u201cWe officially withdraw our membership from the PDP due to undemocratic activities from the party from wards to National level, especially, our North-West region.\u201d\n\nKwankwaso\u2019s entrance into the 2023 presidential race has continued to generate debates. While some observers remained pessimistic about his chances due to the lack of nationwide spread of the NNPP, others say perhaps, he may just be the game changer that no one anticipates.\n\nPundits however, said that Kwankwaso and his associates may have made a miscalculation by dumping the PDP for NNPP. They are of the opinion that his chances of realising his presidential ambition on the platform of the NNPP were slim because time was short for the party to begin to build it structures across Nigeria.\n\nKunle Okunade, political analyst, said that it would be difficult for any third force or coalition to make any difference in 2023, due to the limited time remaining before next year.\n\n\u201cIt will be hard to trick Nigerians with any third force or fourth force at this period so that electorate can identify those that have destroyed the country. Challenging the two parties can\u2019t make any difference. It is too late for the third force to come up because it will be hard for the masses to buy into it at this close time to the election,\u201d Okunade said.\n\nThe idea of a mega platform or a third force is not new in Nigeria; such was the case in 2019 when it was suggested, buoyed by the entrance into partisan politics of some young persons with name recognised in many parts of the country and especially on the social media.\n\nThe new breed politicians made a feeble attempt to unite their forces as Presidential Aspirants Coming Together (PACT) and produce a consensus candidate without succeeding.\n\nDue to disagreement most of them later contested the 2019 presidential election under different platforms, some of the notable names among the politicians were Fela Durotoye, Oby Ezekwesili, Kingsley Moghalu, Donald Duke (SDP) and Omoyele Sowore (AAC).\n\nRead also: History will repeat itself if infighting continues in Edo PDP \u2013 Ayu\n\nHowever, despite the failure of the mega coalition in 2019, it appears some politicians and leaders of conscience are bent on producing a candidate to challenge the candidates of the two leading political parties towards realising their ambition of rescuing Nigeria and Kwankwaso is seen as perhaps, possessing the profile.\n\n\u201cI think it is a good development that we finally have a third force that could possibly challenge APC and PDP. But the party can\u2019t win the presidency in 2023 unless they are planning for 2027,\u201d Anayo Ezugwu, a political analyst, said.\n\n\u201cKwankwaso is a force in Kano and even across the North, but it will be very difficult for him to win the presidency because the two major political parties are considering Southern candidates. And some leaders of thought in the North are in support of power shift to the South,\u201d Ezugwu said.\n\nHe advised Kwankwaso to build structure for future elections rather than hoping to succeed in 2023, adding that he could have been picked as vice presidential candidate if he had remained in PDP.\n\n\u201cSo, I make bold to say that this is a political miscalculation for Kwankwaso and it would have been better for him to stay in PDP and become vice presidential candidate, which will brighten his chances of becoming president in 2031,\u201d he added.\n\nAdelaja Adeoye, a former national publicity secretary of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), expressed doubt in Kwankwaso succeeding in the next year\u2019s presidential election, stressing that the time was too short for his alliance to yield any fruit.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cKwankwaso\u2019s reported defection to the NNPP cannot alter the fact that the 2023 election is a straight battle between APC and PDP.\n\nAs you know, politicians set up structures that can enable them to remain relevant or to negotiate with the big parties. How can few individuals set up or adopt a new political party a few months to the election and expect them to win?\u201d\n\nBut Kwankwaso is not a push over as far as the Nigerian politics is concerned as he enjoys large followership in the North and other parts of the country, with the instrumentality of his foot soldiers, the Kwankwasiya Group.\n\nApart from being a former two-term governor of the most populous North-western state; minister of Defence and senator, among others, he has made impressive attempts at presidential primary elections in both APC and PDP.\n\nIn 2014, Kwankwaso came second to Muhammadu Buhari at the APC presidential primary election and defeated former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and also took fourth position in the 2018 primaries of the APC for the 2019 general election.\n\nThe third force is championed by elder statesman, Tanko Yakasai, President Muhamadu Buhari\u2019s fierce critic; Buba Galadima; former Minister of Sports, Solomon Dalung; former senator from Kaduna State, Suleiman Hunkuyi; former Presidential Adviser, Rufai Ahmed Alkali; former Kogi State governor, Idris Wada; Solomon Edoda; Nweze Onu; Falasade Aliyu; Grace Ben; Umale Shittu; Ibrahim Ringim; Ali Gwaska; Paul Okala; Rufai Hanga; Abdulrahman Abubakar, among many others.",

In five years time, the state can train about 10,000 to 20,000 talents and if 1,000 of these talents become global stars, the state will benefit greatly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad you have accepted to serve but I advise you to separate politics from sports if we must succeed in our plans.

Godwin Obaseki of Edo has charged the State Sports Commission Board to develop 10,000 athletes in different fields of sports in the next five years.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor gave the charge while inaugurating the Yusuf Alli-led Sports Commission on Saturday in Benin.\n\nHe admonished the commission to pursue policies that would ensure the dominance of the state in the entire country in terms of the development and training of athletes.\n\n\u201cEdo is synonymous with sports, we owe what we met on the ground to the next generation. We have to catch them young, we have to rethink sports with all the resources we have.\n\n\u201cWe have to catch them in schools and those outside schools. Success to me will be when we have more that 10,000 Edo sports people.\n\n\u201cThey should be young men and women, who are so good in sports and who can find opportunities locally, nationally and globally.\n\n\u201cPeople need to prepare for the global market, why can\u2019t we start now?\n\n\u201cWe just have to catch them young whether it is in swimming, tennis, basketball, table tennis, handball or football.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to say in five years time we have trained between 10,000 to 20,000 and if 1,000 of those become global stars, see what that would do for us,\u201d he stated.\n\nObaseki also urged the commission to tap into funding from the private sector to develop infrastructure and drive sporting activities.\n\nHe called for total reform and transparency in the administration of sports associations.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cPrivate capital is fundamentally different from the way government capital behaves.\n\n\u201cThere is a high level of transparency because anybody who puts money down wants to see where that money is going to and how that money is being spent.\n\n\u201cThis is because if they don\u2019t see it you can\u2019t attract more. So, we can\u2019t run the associations the way we used to.\n\n\u201cSports is sports, politics is politics, let\u2019s separate them. Sports is professional, let\u2019s bring that level of professionalism to it.\n\n\u201cEdo today has the number one cricket team in Nigeria through private sector spending. I want to see the same in swimming, in gymnastics, in volleyball and handball.\n\n\u201cI want to walk around neighbourhoods and see the availability of courts; courts for different sports, and I believe there are private people ready to make that investment if we give them a clear direction on how to come in.\u201d\n\nNAN reports that Yusuf Alli, a one-time Captain of Team Nigeria and national long jump record holder is the commission\u2019s Chairman and Sabina Chikere is the Permanent Secretary.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Abubakar Malami, Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General and Minister of Justice, has made a u-turn in his latest advice regarding the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, noting that there is no evidence linking the embattled police officer to money laundering.\n\nMalami in a letter dated February 4, 2022, with reference number, DPPA/LA/814/21, sought to exonerate Kyari, saying there was no link between him and Ramon Abbas, alias Hushpuppi, an international fraudster he was accused of receiving money from.\n\nThe AGF\u2019s February letter contradicted his January directive that Kyari should be probed for money laundering and for receiving 33 proceeds of crime.\n\nAccording to the recent letter written on behalf of the AGF by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, the evidence contained in the case diary \u201cwas not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies (N279mn) were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin.\u201d\n\nThe new position of the attorney-general, according to PUNCH, was contained in a letter titled, \u2018Re: Forwarding of the investigation report of the Nigeria Police Force Special Investigation Team and request for legal advice with regards to allegations of criminal conspiracy, aiding and abetting Internet fraud, wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering against DCP Abba Kyari\u2019.\n\nThe letter addressed to the IG, read in part, \u201cI am directed to inform you that after a careful study of the said response wherein you stated that \u2018the monies have been traced to Zenith Bank account no. 2255416115 belonging to Usman Ibrahim Waziri; Guaranty Trust Bank account no. 0130665392 belonging to Adekoya Sikiru; Zenith Bank account no. 2080537566 belonging to Hussein Ala and other funds went to Sharon Festus. The monies were withdrawn and utilised by the aforementioned account holders and the lady.\n\n\u201cIt is our view that the above response has not linked the suspect, DCP Abba Kyari, to the offence of money laundering as the evidence contained in the case diary is not sufficient to indicate or show that the said monies were laundered directly or indirectly by Kyari to disguise their origin, more so that the aforementioned recipients or receivers exonerated him in their statements as having nothing to do with the monies.\u201d\n\nThe justice minister said the police might wish to explore their internal disciplinary measures against Kyari through the Police Service Commission for breaching the code of conduct for law enforcement officers by hobnobbing with suspected fraudsters and people of questionable means in his capacity as a senior officer and head of the IRT.\n\nMalami also said Kyari could be sanctioned for violating the social media policy of the police by responding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s indictment on Facebook; breaching the Police Code of Professional Ethics by accepting complaints and acting on such without recourse to established protocol and detaining a suspect, Vincent Chibuzor, for over a month without a valid court order and regards to his fundamental human rights.\n\nKyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, is wanted in the United States for alleged involvement in a $1.1m scam carried out by Hushpuppi, was suspended by the police last July.\n\nPolice investigations had revealed how a gang of international scammers led by Hushpuppi paid over N235 million to Kyari\u2019s younger brother.\n\nThe police report also said Kyari equally funnelled N44 million into his sibling\u2019s bank account in multiple transactions.\n\nHe is also facing eight counts of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine, and other related offences at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe other defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022 are four members of the IRT, Sunday Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu.\n\nTwo other suspects arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne, were also listed as defendants.\n\nSequel to the report of the Special Investigation Panel which probed Kyari\u2019s alleged links to Hushpuppi, the AGF had affirmed in January that investigations carried out by the police indicted the former IRT commander for money laundering.\n\nMalami, in a legal advice, had therefore, directed the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to carry out further investigations, noting that a prima facie case of money laundering had been established against the DCP.\n\nHe had also said the force should intensify investigation into 33 crime proceeds received by the ex-IRT commander.\n\nThe AGF\u2019s legal advice read in part, \u201cThat there exists prima facie case of conspiracy, collaboration, receipt, conversion, transfer and/or retention of proceeds of unlawful activities contrary to the provision of sections 15, 17 & 18 of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004 and Section 17 of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, Cap E, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, against DCP Abba Kyari and other suspects in view of the overwhelming evidence showing the nature of his disguised financial transactions and activities with Abbas Hushpuppi, Efe Martins, Usman Ibrahim Waziri, Sikiru Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus, who are all confirmed members of an international Internet fraud network.\n\n\u201cAlthough the facts and circumstances of this case as contained in the case file are suggestive to money laundering offences against DCP Abba Kyari and his accomplices namely: Abbas Hushpuppi, Efe Martins, Usman Ibrahim Waziri, Sikiru Adekoya, Hussaini Ala and Sharon Festus; to successfully prosecute them, there is a need for a more thorough dissecting and tracing of the suspected 33 proceeds of crime received by DCP Abba Kyari directly or indirectly through the said accomplices.\u201d\n\nHowever, Malami, in his latest advice contradicted his January directive that Kyari should be probed for money laundering and for receiving proceeds of crime.\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s new position, the DPP said was based on the police report, noting that the police failed to probe the gaps identified in their investigation by the ministry.\n\nAbubakar insisted that the ministry did not say there was no evidence of money laundering against Kyari.\n\nThe DPP stated, \u201cWe said in the absence of the evidence, further investigation is needed and they should go ahead to try him on the administrative offences they have identified. We said they (police) should establish linkages \u2013 the money trail.\n\n\u201cInstead of them to go and investigate further the gaps we identified, they didn\u2019t. They just wrote back to say \u2018check paragraphs so and so\u2019. We are saying no, those paragraphs did not sufficiently establish the things we say you should establish.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the police have yet to submit a fresh report on Kyari as directed by the PSC, PUNCH reported.\n\nThe commission had rejected the police investigation on Kyari carried out by the SIP led by DIG Joseph Egbunike. It ordered a fresh one, which should have been submitted on February 25.\n\nDespite establishing the fact that a total of N279.120mn flowed to the younger Kyari\u2019s bank account at various times from the cyber scam syndicate members, the panel failed to invite or interrogate him.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has blamed the media for giving undue coverage to matters that concern the All Progressives Congress (APC), which he suggested has contributed to crisis rocking the party.\n\nThis as he has advised party members to learn from what he called the failure of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), while warning the leaders and members of the party to desist from \u201cname-calling and backstabbing.\u201d\n\nThe president who spoke in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Garba Shehu, reiterated that the party\u2019s national convention would hold on March 26.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u2018President Buhari asks for order in the APC,\u2019 issued on Saturday, Buhari urged APC members to \u201cremain steadfast and maintain unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLook at the once-powerful, main opposition Peoples Democratic Party now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption.\n\n\u201cThey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate.\n\n\u201cAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that APC started out with a confidence of victory and enjoyed confidence in nearly two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cThis is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\u201cThis alone, in addition to the fact that we didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\n\n\u201cGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nThe presidentalso blamed the media for in the crisis rocking the party.\n\n\u201cIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "title": "Electoral Act 2022: Constitutionality of section 84(12) as argued by Buhari",
          "text": "By Monday Onyekachi Ubani\n\nTo the excitement of all and sundry, especially to those patriotic Nigerians that desire sound electoral legal framework for our fledging democracy, the assent of the President of the Amended Electoral Bill was a welcome development and was greeted with wide applause.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Nigerians will never get it right with leadership if the Electoral legal framework remains archaic and bereft of principles that ensure the votes of the majority count.\n\nThe Amended Electoral Bill introduced some innovations, particularly the reception of limited e-voting and holistic e-transmission of electoral results.\n\nThe major aspect of our electoral stages where manipulations graduate to infamy is at the stage of collation and counting of electoral results. All kinds of malfeasance including criminal input of strange figures in the electoral result sheets usually occur at this stage.\n\nTo cure to a certain extent the bizarre input of un-earned votes by the electoral umpire, the nation canvased and compelled the legislators to insert the clause that adopted electronic transmission of results to eliminate the meddlesomeness of human interference in the system that usually gives birth to strange electoral victories at the poll.\n\nSound and welcome development you will agree with me. However, the President after much persuasion decided to assent to the bill but with a caveat that the National Assembly should ensure that Section 84(12) of the Act be amended as its provision offends the express provision of the constitution pertaining to the rights of certain political class (Appointed Political Office Holders) to associate and participate in the political system in the country.\n\nThe offending Section provides that \u201cNo political appointee AT ANY LEVEL shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nS84(13) further provides that \u201cwhere a political party fails to comply with the provision of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\u201d\n\nThis section truly speaking, disenfranchises political office holders who are appointees of the governor or president from participating at the primary election of the party either as a delegate or as a candidate.\n\nWhen President Buhari was signing this law and was raising his preliminary objection to it, many of us including my humble self did not see the harmful effect as seen by him. The Section is a very dangerous provision.\n\nWe had felt that President Buhari\u2019s complaints and delay in signing the bill was a delay too many and that he should just sign the bill and let us move on as a nation. Recall that the first time the bill was passed and brought to President Buhari, he refused assent citing the provision on party primaries as his reason. Tempers grew and voices were raised against his refusal to sign. The bill when returned was amended to reflect the wish of the President.\n\nIt was a great relief to many Nigerians when the President eventually assented to the bill but with a very serious objection. He sought and received assurance from the leadership of the National Assembly that they will accede to his request to amend the offensive section.\n\nWith the initial reluctance of the President to sign the Bill despite majority voice that he should, nobody was ready to look at the genuiness of the President\u2019s complaints this second time around despite the fact that his complaints may have some undisputable weight.\n\nA careful perusal of the Act reveals a sinister motive meant to pave way to the \u201celected office holders\u201d to have an undue advantage over and above every other political office aspirant in Nigeria. This is pure evil and should not be allowed to stand.\n\nThis Section really offends the provision on the fundamental right against Discrimination. Section 42 of the 1999 Constitution provides as follows:\n\n(1) A citizen of Nigeria of a particular community, ethnic group, place of origin, sex, religion or political opinion shall not, by reason only that he is such a person:- (a) be subjected either expressly by, or in the practical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any executive or administrative action of the government, to disabilities or restrictions to which citizens of Nigeria of other communities, ethnic groups, places of origin, sex, religions or\n\npolitical opinions are not made subject; or (b) be accorded either expressly by, or in the\n\npractical application of, any law in force in Nigeria or any such executive or administrative\n\naction, any privilege or advantage that is not accorded to citizens of Nigeria of other\n\ncommunities, ethnic groups, places of origin, sex, religions or political opinions.\n\nThe summary of the above provision is that it will amount to violation of right against discrimination if someone is denied a right or position that another person of his class or group is allowed to enjoy.\n\nSection 84(12) restricts a political appointee from contesting or voting in the primary election of his political party unless he resigns but the same law allows legislators, governors, local government chairmen who are members of the same political class with the Appointees to remain on their seats to vote and be voted for. This appears absurd, illogical and unacceptable.\n\nThe Court of Appeal in Segun Oni Vs Kayode Fayemi has described Political Appointees as not Public Servants who are bound by the mandatory 30 days resignation clause that they must comply to if they must contest election.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not disturb this decision as it upheld the decision of the Court below by dismissing the appeal on the ground that Segun Oni filed his appeal out of time.\n\nThat decision remains a precedence till date. In other words Political Appointees are not public servants employed in the public service that should resign from office before running for an office.\n\nIf the constitution of 1999 as Amended and approved by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Segun Oni Vs Fayemi held the view that A Political Appointee is not bound to resign from office 30 days before election as Section 318 of the Constitution never qualifies him or her as a Public Servant where does S84(12) derive its validity to disenfrachise the office of political appointee from voting and contesting for a primary election in his political party?\n\nPlethora of authorities have established the principle that where a provision of an enactment by the legislature conflicts with the express provision of the constitution, the said extant law shall be declared null and void for conflicting with the supreme provision of the constitution. That is the essence of S1(3) of the 1999 constitution as Amended. It provides and I quote \u201cIf any other law is inconsistent with the provision of this constitution, this constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void\u201d.\n\nIf the grundnum of the land does not disqualify a political appointee from voting and contesting for an election in his political party, the new Amended Electoral Act does not possess the requisite vires to so do, and as long as it tends to do this, it has to be set aside as it runs contrary to the express provision of the 1999 constitution with regards to Right against Discrimination, Association etc. The validity of this assertion shall be so tested in our vibrant judiciary.\n\nDr. M.O. Ubani is a Legal Practitioner and chairman of NBA SPIDEL",

          "title": "(ICYMI)Osinbajo: RCCG will cause cataclysmic storm, says Dele Momodu",
          "text": "Ovation Magazine boss, Dele Momodu, said the Redeemed Christian Church of God will cause a cataclysmic storm in the House of God if the church continues to scheme Yemi Osinbajo for the 2023 presidency.\n\nMomodu said this while reacting to the newly created Office of Directorate of Politics and Governance by the RCCG headed by Pastor Enoch Adeboye.\n\nAlthough, RCCG Head of Media and Public Relations, Pastor Olaitan Olubiyi said the newly created Office has nothing to do with the Vice-President or any person who may have political ambition in 2023.\n\nBut Momodu said he found out that the new office was launched to create an extensive network for \u201cthe obvious Presidential ambition of Osinbajo.\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful however warned leaders of the Church, saying the easiest way to create trouble in Nigeria today is to attempt to mix religion with politics.\n\nIn the post titled, \u2018My Kobo Advice To The Redeemed Christian Church Of God(RCCG),\u2019 Dele Momodu said:\n\n\u201cNaturally, I feel that I owe it a duty to tell our Church leaders, and our Church in general, the Gospel truth and nothing but the absolute truth. In the light of my relationship with the RCCG, this duty is even more imperative and compelling. I believe the leaders of the RCCG have laboured so hard to build one of the most formidable churches in the world. Nothing must be done to inadvertently cause a cataclysmic storm in the House of God. And the easiest way to create trouble in Nigeria today is any attempt to mix religion with politics. It goes beyond lighting the blue touch paper. It is like combining some highly combustible ingredients together in a chemical laboratory. It is not just that the effect may not be too pleasant, it is that the result and consequences will be catastrophic. God forbid.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I read the memo establishing a political arm of our Church, I realised this was nothing but an invitation to Armageddon, if true. For that reason, at first, I assumed the memo was a joke, a fake document that was merely meant to stir the hornets\u2019 nest, so I did not pay too much attention to it. However, when it started flying in from every direction to my phones, I knew someone had touched the tiger by the tail. I started working the phones to speak to a few contacts who should know about it and be able to confirm the veracity or otherwise of the document. The outcome was a resounding yes, the document had emanated from the Church and was acquiesced to by the upper echelons.\n\n\u201cI asked for what the motive(s) could have been, and the general conspiracy theory was that our church was setting up an extensive network for the obvious Presidential ambition of the current Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, although couched in terms which ostensibly suggested that the Church wished to support all of its congregation who wished to contest the next general elections and made their aspirations known to the newly formed Church department. Personally, that theory didn\u2019t jell with me. To the best of my knowledge, Professor Osinbajo is not the only member of the church contesting the Presidential election. And it was not the church that nominated him as running mate to President Muhammadu Buhari. He got the job primarily because of his closeness to his former Principal, then Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and also because of his admirable credentials, ability and capacity. His religion was necessarily a factor because a Northern Moslem must perforce pick a Southern Christian as his running mate in the current Nigerian clime. That was the only reason religion came into it, I believe. It had nothing to do with the fact that he is a senior pastor of the RCCG.\n\n\u201cEven if the Vice President has now decided to bear his own father\u2019s name by dropping that of his avuncular godfather, the church will still face a moral crisis if it wishes to jump on the bandwagon by drumming up support for Professor Osinbajo on religious grounds alone for many reasons, some of which I will now highlight.\u201d\n\nDele Momodu added Osinbajo is not the only member of the Church who might have an ambition for the Presidency.\n\nHe said he\u2019s also a member of the RCCG as well as Senator Remi Tinubu who is married to Bola Tinubu, a Muslim that has declared his ambition for the 2023 Presidency.\n\nDele Momodu added that he expected RCCG to at least pretend that Osinbajo is not the church\u2019s candidate for the 2023 presidency.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a Muslim, his dear beloved wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu is a staunch member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God and one of the leading lights of the Church. Asiwaju, her husband, is a frontline Presidential aspirant on the platform of APC, just like his godson, the Vice President. Even if the RCCG has a preference in Professor Osinbajo, mainly because of his status in the Church and his current position in Government, I expect the RCCG to \u201cpretend\u201d a little and behave as if it is not so. Not to do that would be tantamount to picking a child out of one\u2019s children and say, \u201cthis is my favorite!\u201d It is simply not right or proper for the RCCG to demonstrate such blatant and flagrant partisanship.\n\n\u201cAs if that is not a tough cookie to handle, there is the fact that that there is a third contender, yours truly, Dele Momodu, who\u2019s also a member of the RCCG and the youngest of the contending Church aspirants so far. I\u2019m also the only member of the RCCG aspiring on the platform of PDP, as far as I know. Would the Church then ask its congregation to vote for one party over the other merely because it has decided to support one candidate in preference to the other regardless of the strong points one may have over the other? What a conundrum and crisis this portends for the Church and its unity and peace.\n\n\u201cThe church cannot even afford to ostracise any aspirant on the basis of religious persuasion or denomination. It is the job of the church to seek out and promote the best candidates and then pray for them and galvanize support for them perhaps clandestinely.\n\n\u201cI also imagine that there is some degree of unconstitutionality to this attempt by the RCCG to descend into the political arena. Nigeria is a secular state as the constitution provides. To suggest that one candidate is the preferred candidate of a particular church or religious group and is being effectively sponsored by that church will breach not just the morality and ethos of the Church but also the deeply enshrined principles and ground norm of our constitution, which are embedded and engraved for good reason.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there are no guarantees that being a church Pastor or otherwise would make you a competent and truthfully honest leader. The church is too massive and extremely influential to reduce itself to such a level of myopia. Since what most Nigerians desire today is good and accountable leadership, our Churches should smartly work towards identifying the best materials in different political parties and support us spiritually and materially from the humongous resources it has pleased God to bless them with.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it is my belief that our churches should avoid anything that could further escalate the huge religious and socio-political conflagration already ravaging our long-suffering nation. Just imagine what would happen if other church denominations or other religions decide to support their own members only. It would be palpable anarchy in the making. Nigeria will then end up with a Babel of voices and a cacophony of noises which would not augur well for the wellbeing of us all, but only cause misery and upheaval.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope and pray that our Church, the RCCG, will douse this unnecessary fire and recant and retrace its steps before it is too late.\u201d",

          "text": "The federal government of Nigeria has declared illegal the operations of online banks such as GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Kashkash, Speedy Choice, and Easy Moni.\n\nOn Friday, the Federal Competition Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) raided the offices of financial institutions operating on Opebi Road in Ikeja, Lagos, in collaboration with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the National Information Technology Development Agency, and the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nCustomers had complained to the FCCPC about financial firms\u2019 malpractices, according to the FCCPC.\n\nCustomers had accused banking institutions of abusing their privacy in their debt recovery efforts, according to Babatunde Irukera, Chief Executive Officer, FCCPC, who spoke about the raid.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. Some time ago, when the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise in money lenders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause there was lockdown due to the pandemic, people needed small easy loan which is understandable. But over a period of time, people started complaining about the malpractices of the lenders, so we started tracking it\u201d\n\n\u201cTowards the end of last year, we gathered quite a lot of information. We started working with some other key agencies and the FCCPC led the meeting where we all agreed there would be a joint effort to look into these businesses.\u201d\n\nIrukera explained that the interest rate charged by online financial institutions appear to violate the ethics of how lending is done.\n\n\u201cThe key two things that were subject of concern were what seems to be the naming and shaming violation of people\u2019s privacy with respect to how these lenders recover their loans,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the interest rate seems to be a violation of the ethics on how lending is done. So, those were the two things that we set out to look for.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms. That has been a very difficult thing. We did that for several months and some of them have moved from one place to the another and we have been visiting these places for months.\n\n\u201cWe found out that most of these companies operate from the same place. We also found out that many of them are actually operated by the same person. They are not Nigerian companies, they don\u2019t have an address in Nigeria and they are not registered in Nigeria with the Corporate Affairs Commission and they do not have any licence to do their business\u201d\n\nIrukera said the agency had written to global app companies asking them to suspend the operations of the online banks.\n\nHe said, \u201cEssentially, what they have is an app, and so we started gathering more information about them. We engaged the public and the people who had been their victims. They gave us more information\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we got more information we had enough evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for us to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure. And sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we are hitting at the place we could get many of them.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cIn addition to what you are seeing here today, the FCCPC has also issued multiple orders today. Two of them are going to vendors: Apple and Google stores where some of these apps are available. We have asked them to shut these companies\u2019 apps down so that people will not be victimised anymore. Secondly, some of them (the orders) have gone to the bank, asking them to freeze the accounts used by these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must add though that not all money lenders are operating illegally and that is why it has been taking time for us to track these people.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones, no. We want to start with them. We also understand that they are between five and seven companies operating at the same location.\u201d",
          "summary": "The federal government of Nigeria has declared illegal the operations of online banks such as GoCash, Okash, EasyCredit, Kashkash, Speedy Choice, and Easy Moni.\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago.\nSome time ago, when the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise in money lenders,\u201d he said.\nHe said, \u201cEssentially, what they have is an app, and so we started gathering more information about them.\nWe also understand that they are between five and seven companies operating at the same location.\u201d",

          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has broken his silence over the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress.\n\nIn a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Garba Shehu, the president warned the leaders and members of APC to desist from \u201cname-calling and backstabbing\u201d.\n\nHe reiterated that the party\u2019s national convention would hold on March 26.\n\nThe president urged APC members to \u201cremain steadfast and maintain unity if the party is to continue in the path of victory and its dominance at all levels throughout the country\u201d.\n\nThe statement also quoted Buhari as asking members of the party to \u201clook at the once-powerful, main opposition Peoples Democratic Party now enfeebled and adrift and learn lessons in disunity, mismanagement and corruption\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey (PDP) failed in 16 years in power and a failure as opposition.\n\n\u201cYes, we are entitled to our own share of dissent and intra-party discord. These are common in all parties, left and right all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut parties splintered by competing egos destine themselves to the worst possible fate.\n\n\u201cAs the country prepares for the long run-up to the 2023 presidential election, we all expect a robust debate on the issues that matter and what is going in the APC should be a reflection of this, not the infighting we are seeing. There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe claimed that APC started out with a confidence of victory and enjoyed confidence in nearly two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\n\u201cThis is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\n\u201cThis alone, in addition to the fact that we didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandisement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\n\n\u201cGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nThe president, however, blamed the role of the media in the crisis rocking the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\n\u201cWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\n\u201cOf course, the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\n\u201cThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.\u201d\n\nDetails later\u2026",

Ibrahim and his companies had claimed that AMCON and other defendants in a suit pending before the court had flouted orders previously made.\n\nIn response to Ibrahim and his three companies\u2019 ex-parte motion, Justice Abang ordered that Form 48 (notice of consequences of disobedience to court order) and Form 49 (notice to show cause why an order for committal to prison should not be made pursuant to Section 72 of the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and Order 9 Rule 13 of the Judgments Enforcement Rules) be issued and served on the three named principal officers of AMCON.\n\nThe judge issued the orders after hearing from Victor Ogbonna, the lawyer for Ibrahim and his three companies, who claimed that despite giving undertakings to obey court orders in the pending suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 filed by his clients, AMCON disobeyed the orders by taking actions that could jeopardize the case\u2019s subject.\n\nNICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, and NICON Reinsurance Corporation Plc are the firms suing Ibrahim.\n\nA copy of the enrolled order of the ruling, sighted in Abuja on Friday reads: \u201cThe court having considered the allegations that the 1st to 12th defendants (in the pending suit \u2013 FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021) have flouted the undertakings freely, voluntarily given by their counsel on 16/8/2021 that the defendants will not take steps to undermine the subject matter of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit and the said undertakings reaffirmed by their counsel in court in the proceedings of 9/3/2022.\n\n\u201cThe court having also considered that, based on the said undertakings freely given by the defendants\u2019 counsel and binding on the defendants, this court on 16/8/2021 made an order restraining the defendants from taking steps to flout order made in the plaintiffs favour pending hearing and determination of the suit.\n\n\u201cThe having considered that the said undertaking was made by consent of the defendants and is not appealable except with leave of court.\n\n\u201cThe court having also considered that it is alleged that the defendants violated the court\u2019s order and the alleged violations are as mentioned in the body of the ruling delivered in the open court today the 11th of March, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe court having considered that it is legally impossible to cite AMCON, as an institution, for contempt where it is alleged that it has flouted court\u2019s order, that it is the natural persons, the principal officers, the prime movers, the alter ego, the directing minds that take decisions for AMCON.\n\n\u201cAnd the court having considered, where AMCON is alleged to have flouted court\u2019s order, it is the natural persons that take decisions for it that should be cited for contempt.\n\n\u201cThe court having considered that, in exercise of its disciplinary jurisdiction under its inherent powers as preserved under Section 6(6)A&B of 1999 Constitution (as amended), it is deserving to grant leave to enable the Plaintiffs commence committal proceedings against the principal officers of AMCON that take decisions for AMCON, as the court cannot grant an order in vain and a subsisting order of court is uncompromising binding on parties and must be obeyed unless set aside.\n\n\u201cAnd the having delivered its ruling in the open court and its reasoning and conclusions are as contained in the body of the ruling.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n*That leave is hereby granted to the plaintiffs to commence committal proceedings by issuance of Forms 48 and 49 and same served on Ahmed Lawal Kure (Managing Director/CEO, AMCON), Eberechukwu Uneze (Executive Director AMCON) and Aminu Ismail (Executive Director AMCON) being natural persons, prime movers, alter ego, directing minds, principal officers of AMCON that allegedly flouted the subsisting order of court made on 16/8/2021 re-stated on 9/3/2022 predicated on the subsisting undertakings made by the defendants\u2019 counsel given freely on 16/8/2021 that the defendants will not take steps to favour of the plaintiffs herein or undermine the subject matter of the suit pending hearing and determination of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit.\n\n*That the plaintiffs shall endorse Form 48 on the enrolled order of this court dated 9/3/2022 and same served on persons mentioned in item 1 of the instant enrolled order.\n\n*That the plaintiffs shall as of right issue Forms 48 and 49 and same endorsed on the enrolled order of this court dated 9/3/2022 and served on the 3rd to 12th defendants.\u201d",

He timed his run to perfection as Jadon Sancho made the most of Sergio Reguilon\u2019s struggles within the Tottenham defensive line to deliver the low cross that his vastly experienced team-mate turned home with ease.\n\nAnd if anyone was likely to get a winner, it was United\u2019s number seven.\n\nWhen he did, Ronaldo was immediately replaced to a standing ovation that was totally deserved.",

Raine already confirmed they will be waiting to hear a proper offer for the club from now until the Tuesday dealine so anything can happen from now until then.\n\nIn Ireland, Conor McGregor already made his offer but it\u2019s far below what the other candidates have. If the UFC legend wants to buy Chelsea, he will have to upgrade his current offer of \u00a31.5 billion.\n\nIt is believed that an acceptable offer would be of around \u00a33 billion in order to consider it properly.\n\nHowever, the club\u2019s dire situation could push them to accept a lower offer than that.",

There must be no more distractions ahead of the convention to choose new leaders.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the APC started out with a confidence of victory and the party today enjoys that confidence in nearly two-thirds of our 36 states.\n\nYet, he noted, this is a party that has been in existence barely for eight years, becoming the dominant party because it has thrown open its doors to defectors from other parties, big and small.\n\nThis alone, addition to the fact \u201dwe didn\u2019t start on the note of arrogance of power, nor see government as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, to be held at all costs, but a vehicle to bring development to all without discrimination-political, ethnic or regional to our dear country made this success possible.\u201d\n\nThe party, he went on to note, is proud of the fact that in its short period of existence, it has won two general elections decisively and despite losing a few states in 2019, it steadfastly expanded its pan-Nigerian outlook with significant defections of the opposition Governors and parliamentarians into its fold.\n\n\u201dGiven all that is at a stake, we can expect contests into offices as we are now faced with to be heated although candidates and their promoters for party offices are not so much debating policy differences but differences of management, personality, character, and suitability for the most important leadership roles in our country and therefore the continent.\u201d\n\nIt is equally clear that over the last week or so, the internal management affairs of the APC have been afforded generous media coverage \u2013 over and above its importance to the voters of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to ask what benefits the poor are getting during the period of intense negative coverage.\n\nWhen precisely the party\u2019s convention is held and who is the party\u2019s chairman is hardly a matter for the average voter: vastly more important is who convention delegates will elect as the party\u2019s flagbearer in the coming weeks to take forward the party\u2019s platform to the people in the general election in February next year.\n\nIt is therefore important for the media to put such matters into perspective. No-one is debating policy differences here. That is for the general election. None of the declared aspirants and any of those that may step forward will change because of who may be in the party in the chairman\u2019s seat. It is essentially the same party.\n\nOf course the media are welcome to comment on the content of the character of the potential APC candidates; discuss their suitability for leadership; scrutinize their offer to the membership. But to focus on the routine internal divisions and magnify them into what they have become today is a waste of everyone\u2019s time, amounting to no more than a discussion over seating arrangements.\n\nThis is not what Nigerians talk of in their communities. They have an inclination only for things that matter.",

          "title": "INEC letter: Bello's CECPC makes u-turn, says Buni still in charge -",
          "text": "The Governor Abdullahi Sani Bello-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has made a U-Turn moments after a leaked letter from the Independent National Electoral Commission had subtly rejected the invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe Bello-led CECPC had on Wednesday, 8 March written to the electoral body inviting it to the emergency NEC meeting of the party. The INEC in its reply stated clearly that the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC, runs contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2014).\n\nAddressing the media at the Buhari House National Secretariat of the party on Friday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, said, \u201cSomebody asked, what is the position of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the party, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of all as the Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case. Now, we have a Convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. Why is it so difficult for people to understand that? Why is it so difficult for people to simply understand? I cannot understand why people are making this allegation.\n\n\u201cSo, Governor Sani Bello is acting the full authority of the Caretaker Committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders and with the full consent of Governor Mai Mala Buni. It is very clear and simple. If anybody has issues with any of our decisions, he can head to court. For now, we are doing it with the full backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity on this, absolutely none.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Senator John James Akpanudodehe, what is the position because I spelt others out the other members of the committee, but I didn\u2019t say anything about other people as well, we just talked about members of the committee. I didn\u2019t talk about their positions, whether secretary or chairman, since they have their responsibilities spelt out for them.\n\n\u201cThe other members are the ones told to come back to handle specific departments and that is what we are doing. At the full course of time, once all these are over, I will be able to brief you. But for now, these are the responsibilities of every member.\n\n\u201cAs part of efforts towards the hitch-free conduct of the March 26th National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) stepped up preparations this week.\n\n\u201cConvened a meeting chaired by the Acting Chairman and Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello, where strategies were adopted to fast-track the process towards conducting a National Convention;\n\n\u201c35 State chairmen of the APC and that of the FCT were sworn-in and mandated to work towards ensuring unity and harmony in their states. They were also charged to mobilise the members and the people to enable the party win future elections;\n\n\u201cReceived and deliberated on the report of the Committee on zoning. After exhaustively deliberating on the report, it was approved and the zoning formula was made public. The zoning formula was well-received by members of the party and all Nigerians;\n\n\u201cAssigned schedules of specific responsibilities to each members of the Caretaker Committee aligned to the existing Directorates at the Party\u2019s headquarters. The purpose is to ensure speedy execution of the various activities leading to the National Convention on March 26, 2022. The exercise has the additional benefit of ensuring synergy between the leadership of the party and the Directorates.\n\n\u201cDeliberated on and disagreed with the Federal High Court in its judgement on the status of the Governor of Ebonyi state over his sound decision to leave the PDP and join the APC along with the majority of members of the State House Assembly; CECPC regards the judgement as a travesty of justice and stand with the Governor and Ebonyi state legislators on appealing to a higher court;\n\n\u201cStreamlined and expanded the leadership of the various sub committees for the conduct of National Convention by bringing in more Governors and Ministers of the Federal Republic to spearhead the process. This has obviously fostered and deepened sense of belonging, inclusiveness and reflect the mosaic nature of the membership of the party;\n\n\u201cReviewed and strengthened the membership of the National Convention Subcommittees by making them compact and lighter. The subcommittees earlier composed were unnecessarily unwieldy and comprised excessive number of members, a situation that can reduce their efficiency;\n\n\u201cThe CECPC committee chaired by His Excellency the Governor of Niger State has issued a notice for a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party on March 17, 2022. As usual, a number of important issues will be discussed at the meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to questions from journalists, Ismaeel Ahmed disclosed that the previously scheduled Zonal Congresses will now be part of the National Convention. He assured that the March 26th National Convention was on course and sacrosanct.",

The EssLibra Terminal is an integrated logistics off-dock terminal, ready for all export activities such as stuffing, on-site customs clearance and barging services.\n\nThe agency said the terminal covered an area of 120,000 square metres (sqm) that includes an export processing zone, trailer park, RoRo facility and fuel dump.\n\nSpeaking at the flag-off ceremony, the Managing Director of NPA, Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko, asked all agencies involved in the export processing value chain to deploy adequate personnel and work in synergy to ensure efficiency and quick turnaround in the processing of export cargoes.\n\nWhile commending the management of EssLibra for the quality of facilities at the terminal, he assured them of the readiness of NPA to remove all impediments against the seamless handling of locally manufactured exports and agro-allied commodities.\n\nBello Koko asked the management of the terminal to resist the temptation to veer off export processing for which the facility was built.\n\nAccording to him, the rationale for the establishment of the terminal is to have a one-stop shop where all inspection, consolidation and stuffing of export-bound cargo will be conducted in a synchronised manner to eliminate all the delays that rendered Nigeria\u2019s non-oil exports uncompetitive.\n\nHe said the NPA management would effectively implement all government policies geared towards the promotion of exports, as well as strengthening indigenous capacity through the promotion of local content.\n\n\u201cWe took cognisance of local content in the certification process of this terminal, and this is why I expect the host community to take ownership of this terminal and support its operations, because of the multiplier benefits to the host community\u201d, a statement by Ibrahim Nasiru, general manager of NPA\u2019s corporate and strategic communications division, quoted Bello-Koko as saying.\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director of EssLibra Nigeria Limited, Yemi Adunola, thanked the NPA and its technical partners, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), for their unalloyed support.\n\nHe pledged his company\u2019s readiness to render efficient services and a commitment to continuous improvement through sustained investments in human capital and requisite technology.\n\nEromosele Abiodun",

          "text": "Despite the decision of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to raise crude oil production by 340,000 barrels per day last month, the gap between the group\u2019s actual output and target still widened to 890,000 bpd, according to the cartel\u2019s report.\n\nIt was also a month that saw Nigeria raise output to 1.51 million bpd, a marked improvement from the previous few months when the country struggled to produce between 1.2 million bpd and 1.4 bpd.\n\nNigeria has been constrained in meeting its OPEC allocation for months, and as of January had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by OPEC+, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nAlthough there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country\u2019s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nThe latest report showed that production from OPEC+ participants was 38.25 million bpd in February, up from 37.91 million bpd in January, but below the target of 39.14 million, according to an Argus survey, which shares insights and analyses about energy and commodity markets worldwide.\n\nBut oil prices rose at the weekend, although they experienced their biggest weekly declines since November on fears of escalating bans on Russian oil as against efforts to bring more supply to the market from other major producers.\n\nIn a week of volatile trading marked by talk of Russian oil embargoes then potential supply additions from Iran, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates while fighting escalated in Ukraine, Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark fell 5.2 per cent after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13 on Monday.\n\nIn the same vein, US crude was dropped 6.6 per cent after touching a high of $130.50 at the start of the trading week.\n\nA day earlier, crude oil prices fell significantly, tumbling from a 2008 high of $130, about the largest single-day percentage decline since April 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s benchmark oil dropped 13 per cent to $111 a barrel, while the WTI crude oil which topped $130 at the height of trading earlier in the week, lost 12 per cent.\n\nThe latest report indicated that notably, the quota-exempt OPEC members, Iran and Libya raised output by a combined 170,000 bpd in February, with the north African country accounting for 130,000 bpd of this after an early-January restart of four crude and condensate fields.\n\nBut 14 of the wider group\u2019s 19 members, including Nigeria, produced below quota in the month, as dwindling spare capacity, underinvestment and infrastructure restraints have constrained output increases.\n\nThe OPEC+ group\u2019s stance on rising prices is that they are down to geopolitics and not market fundamentals, with the organisation\u2019s Secretary-General, Mr Sanusi Barkindo, saying during the week that \u201cwe have no control over current events.\u201d\n\nBarkindo stated that despite the surging crude oil prices, there\u2019s no shortage of the commodity in the market, although he admitted that not all member countries are currently able to fulfil their obligations because of capacity constraints.\n\nOPEC+ ministers will meet on March 31, to decide a production strategy for May, when five countries \u2014 Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE \u2014 will see upwards revisions to the baseline levels that determine their quotas and compliance.\n\nThis would see the combined monthly output quota increase move to 432,000 bpd from 400,000 bpd, which could go some way to satisfying calls for the group to raise the pace of production increases.\n\nMinister of State Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, last week said that the absence of long-term investment in the oil and gas sector, as well as insecurity, should be blamed on Nigeria\u2019s current low crude oil production.\n\nSylva stated that this development was responsible for the inability of Nigeria to meet the OPEC quota in recent times in addition to the speed with which International Oil Companies (IOCs) and other investors were withdrawing investments in hydrocarbon exploitation.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "There is anxiety among members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the national caucus of the main opposition party and the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) meet on Monday and Tuesday to take a decision on the presidential ticket of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nIn a memo to its national caucus, the main opposition party has directed members of the caucus to consider whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\nThe party also urged its national caucus to determine the implications of throwing the presidential ticket open.\n\nWith the election of its National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu from the North, it was expected that the party\u2019s presidential candidate would emerge from the South.\n\nBut the main opposition party has been playing hide-and-seek with the issue of where its presidential candidate would come from, raising concerns that it might throw the ticket open, against the popular agitation for power to shift to the South.\n\nUnlike the PDP, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has set the necessary machinery in motion to choose its presidential candidate from the South.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the two organs of the PDP will decide whether to zone or throw open the presidential ticket of the party for the 2023 general election.\n\nPDP NEC will also decide on the recommendation of the 2019 Elections Review Committee set up by the party to assess its performance in the last general election.\n\nThe committee headed by the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed had in its recommendation submitted to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party on May 21, 2021, urged the party to allow interested party members to vie for the 2023 presidency, irrespective of their geopolitical zones.\n\nThe committee had anchored its position on the fact that across the land, Nigeria boasts of good hands capable of bailing the country \u201cout of her current quagmire.\u201d\n\nThe report of the committee had stated that: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North-east and South-east geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency, should be given special consideration, in choosing the presidential flagbearer of the party, for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. Moreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader, with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian, from every part of the country, should be allowed to choose the best candidate, through a credible primary election; as a way of institutionalising a merit-based leadership recruitment process, for the country.\u201d\n\nReceiving the report, the former leader of the party under Prince Uche Secondus had pledged that the NEC would set up a technical committee to review the report, but it never did.\n\n\n\nA source within the party\u2019s NWC told THISDAY at the weekend that: \u201cThese two organs of the party will look at the report of Governor Bala Mohammed\u2019s committee and in their wisdom decide to either throw the presidential ticket open or zone it to one of the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\n\u201cIn the memo to the national caucus, there are variables we want them to consider. One is whether geopolitical zoning is in the interest of the PDP in winning the presidential election come 2023 and two, what will it cost the PDP if it throws the presidential ticket open.\n\n\u201cThree, as a party in opposition whether zoning in the PDP is in the overall interest of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that after the National Caucus and NEC meetings, the party\u2019s NWC will still take the issue to the Board of Trustees (BoT) and the PDP governors as well as the National Assembly caucus before a final decision would be reached. THISDAY gathered that the report of the Bauchi State governor\u2019s committee would form the main agenda of the national caucus meeting and NEC meetings of the PDP.A source within the party\u2019s NWC told THISDAY at the weekend that: \u201cThese two organs of the party will look at the report of Governor Bala Mohammed\u2019s committee and in their wisdom decide to either throw the presidential ticket open or zone it to one of the six geo-political zones of the country.\u201cIn the memo to the national caucus, there are variables we want them to consider.

Appointment of Mobilisation Director Divides PDP Govs Meanwhile, the governors of the PDP are already divided over the appointment of a substantive director of mobilisation and organisation for the party.\n\nThe Department of Mobilisation and Organisation of the party is the engine room of the PDP in terms of the election of all delegates, both ad-hoc and statutory delegates, as well as election management.\n\nThe department is under the control and supervision of the National Organising Secretary, Umar Bature, who is a nominee of the Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, who is a presidential aspirant.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a governor from one of the South-south states is the arrowhead of those who want the substantive director replaced with a new director from either Delta State or Imo or Kogi State, so as not to give any presidential aspirant undue advantage.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that some other governors of the party and the incumbent National Organising Secretary, Umar have rejected the names of those recommended for appointment for the position of new Director of Mobilisation and Organisation.
