          "title": "Workers kick as FCTA bars unvaccinated staff from offices",
          "text": "The Federal Capital Territory Administration on Monday barred workers and visitors without proof of vaccination or negative PCR test done within 72 hours from assessing its offices.\n\nThis, however, led to outrage as some workers accused the FCTA of not respecting their rights.\n\nThe administration had penultimate week notified workers and visitors that unvaccinated persons and those without negative PCR test would be barred from entering its offices.\n\nOn Monday, a team of FCTA officials enforced the directive.\n\nOur correspondent observed that workers without vaccination cards returned home, while others were seen loitering around.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, one of the staff members lamented that she was not being allowed despite showing the soft copy of her card.\n\nShe said, \u201cI do not want to misplace my vaccination card. That was why I snapped it on my phone, the name on the card matched with my identity card. I see no reason I should be denied access.\n\n\u201cI am not the only one that did that. I did not forge my card; they can log into their website and see for themselves. It is insensitive of them to have done this to me.\u201d\n\nAnother civil servant said, \u201cThis is annoying. You are asking us not to enter our offices because you want us to get vaccinated? This is unfortunate. The administration should rather step up its advocacy and not flex muscle by deploying security operatives here. Their services are more needed in other places within the territory.\u201d\n\nAddressing newsmen, the Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, Ikharo Attah, said the enforcement would be sustained to ensure maximum compliance.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will be following up seriously on this and we have also warned people not to snap their card on the phone as we want to see the original card, don\u2019t show us vaccination card on the phone.\n\n\u201cWe will be asking for identity cards and we will match the cards with your COVID-19 vaccination card so that you don\u2019t bring someone else\u2019s card as your own.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law, Monday Ubani, has dragged the Federal Government to court over its insistence on vaccine mandate.\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, SAN; and the Federal Government are respondents in the suit.\n\nAccording to the suit filed before the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos, Ubani asked for a perpetual injunction restraining the SGF from implementing or furthering the directive given to the civil servants.\n\nHe described the directive as unconstitutional, adding that it violated the constitutional rights of civil servants to life, dignity, privacy, freedom from discrimination, freedom of thought, conscience and religion as guaranteed by Sections 34, 37 and 38 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Make this facility impregnable. This is a red zone, dangerous zone. Whoever attempts to breach the security here is already dead. He must not live to tell the story. Other people will tell his or her story.\n\n\u201cAny effort to breach our facility is not acceptable. Don\u2019t shoot to injure, shoot to kill. Don\u2019t shoot to disable, shoot to kill.

But most importantly, you must be effective in preventing the penetration of this facility. You must have the capacity to repel viciously any attempt to penetrate this facility.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the Maximum Security Custodial Centre, Olomi area of Ibadan, the minister lamented that custodial centres in the country were holding inmates much more than their designed capacities.\n\nHe said the Federal Government was working on some measures to ensure that the facilities are decongested very soon.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto; Barr. Nyesom Wike of Rivers; Senator Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta; Seyi Makinde of Oyo; Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu; Bala Mohamed of Bauchi and the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahdi Aliyu Muhammed at the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum meeting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Monday.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum has urged the National Assembly to immediately conclude issues surrounding the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by overriding President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto.\n\nThe forum made the call in a communique at the end of its meeting on Monday in Port-Harcourt.\n\nIn the communique read by it\u2019s Chairman and Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, the governors said that overriding Buhari\u2019s veto would quicken resolution of the issue and not provide the President another opportunity to delay signing of the Bill by withholding assent again.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:Twitter: APC govt should apologize to Nigerians for infringing on their rights -Reps\u2019 minority caucus\n\nThe forum deplored the unabating insecurity and economic crises plaguing the country, pointing out that all economic indices bequeathed to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by the PDP in 2015 had collapsed.\n\nThe communique reads: \u201cThe PDP Governors\u2019 Forum congratulated the entire PDP family for conducting a smooth and successful National Convention that led to the emergence of the highly-acclaimed Senator Iyiochia Ayu-led National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cThe forum commended the new PDP National Working Committee for hitting the ground running with respect to repositioning the PDP as a credible party for the rescue and rebuilding of Nigeria which has been battered by bad economy, insecurity, unemployment and other social ills hoisted on citizens by the incompetent and inept APC administration.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors requested the National Assembly to quickly conclude deliberation on the Electoral Act Amendment either by overriding the President\u2019s veto or delete the areas of complain.\n\n\u201cThe meeting advised that the option of overriding the President\u2019s veto will lead to a quicker resolution to deny him the opportunity to once again truncate a reformed electoral jurisprudence for Nigeria because an early concluded Electoral Act is vital for credible elections.\u201d\n\nThe governors also decried the rising spate of insecurity in the country and the inability of the APC administration to confront kidnappers and bandits spilling the blood of innocent Nigerians on daily basis.\n\nAccording to the communique, the meeting expressed regrets at Buhari\u2019s unwillingness to consider the issue of state police which would help to tackle insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWe urge Mr President to reconsider his view and consider decentralisation of the Police\n\n\u201cAnd, the meeting once again reviewed the state of the nation and observed that key economic indicators were on steady decline and it is clear that the APC government is a massive failure going from the record the PDP handed over to them.\n\n\u201cThe PDP handed over a 550 billion dollar-strong economy, the largest in Africa in 2015, but under APC, Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 under the PDP, the exchange rate was N198 to a dollar, it is now over N500 per dollar under the APC.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, unemployment rate was 7.3 per cent under the PDP, it is now 33 per cent under the APC administration and one of the highest in the world.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, the pump price of petrol was N87 per litre, it is now N165 per litre and climbing under the APC administration.\n\n\u201cDebt servicing under APC now takes over 98 per cent of the federal budget, the third in the world per earnings.\n\n\u201cThe forum noted that in the management of oil and gas resources, the administration of the Federation Account has remained opaque, confusing and non-transparent.\n\n\u201cThe meeting urges all Nigerians from all works of life, particularly the youths, to register enmasse with INEC to exercise their franchise in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 elections is a very important election that should be used to end the inept APC government that had the arrogance to deny the youths the use of Twitter, a social media-friendly tool for the youths for over a year.\n\n\u201cThe youths now have the opportunity to decide those who lead them in 2023,\u201d it added.\n\nThe forum commended the host, Governor Nyesom Wike, for his outstanding contributions to the growth of the party.\n\nIn attendance were Govs Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, \u2013 Sokoto State; Udom Emmanuel \u2013 Akwa Ibom; Douye Diri \u2013 Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom \u2013 Benue; Ifeanyi Okowa \u2013 Delta and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi \u2013 Enugu State.\n\nOthers are Nyesom Wike \u2013 Rivers; Oluseyi Makinde \u2013 Oyo State; Ahmadu Fintiri \u2013 Adamawa and Bala Mohammed \u2013 Bauchi State.",

A few hours later she was dead!\n\n\u201cWe were shell-shocked by this dramatic turn of events and remain shocked.

          "text": ".\n\nFormer President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has described former Head of the Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan as a man of great vision, stressing that Nigeria would have benefitted more if the late Head of State had been allowed to stay longer in office.\n\nDr Jonathan stated this while paying a condolence visit to the family of the late Head of State in Lagos on Monday. Chief Shonekan who died on January 11, 2022, was in office for about three months, between August 26, 1993, to November 17, 1993, before he was overthrown in a coup.\n\nThe former President described Shonekan as a leader with an enviable background in the corporate world and considerable knowledge of economic issues.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after paying a condolence visit to the Shonekan family, Jonathan praised the late Head of State\u2019s work ethic, adding that he meant well for the nation.\n\nHe said further: \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was somebody I worked with closely as one of the members of the Council of State. I learnt so much from him when I was in the office. When I was president, I was presiding over the Council of States meetings. I was then the youngest member of the Council. So when I left office, I remained the youngest member of the Council of State. And listening to him, I learnt a lot because he was a man with great wisdom, a man with a good background in the corporate world and a good background in economic issues.\n\n\u201cAs a private citizen, he founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group that is still there today. He was the brain behind Vision 2010. He was a man who had a great vision for this country.\n\nStressing that Shonekan meant well for the country, Dr Jonathan said: \u201cMy regret is that he left government too early, and I believed that if he had stayed as head of interim government for about two, three years, and probably midwife the political process, even the controversies we are having with the 1999 Constitution today, we probably wouldn\u2019t have had it.\n\n\u201cHe left too early because of the military intervention, and the rest, of course, you know, I don\u2019t want to say much about it.\n\n\u201cHe was a thorough minded person, he would have made sure that all the i\u2019s were properly dotted and the t\u2019s were properly crossed. And probably, we would have been moving in a different direction today,\u201d the former president said.\n\n\u201cWhen he took office as Head of Interim Government, the first thing he did was to release political prisoners. That now opened up a space for Nigerians to begin to participate in economic and social activities.\n\n\u2018So he had a vision, but we lost him too early in the government and of course, we have lost him finally,\u201d he added\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We are one group of stakeholders in the party and our party respects institutions. The appropriate organ of the party to announce the date is the National Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed and they will announce a date in February but the announcement comes from the party. It is the party\u2019s decision. There are other stakeholders that they are consulting and to show respect and institutional limit, we are not going to over step our bound. However, February is sacrosanct,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile giving update on the meeting, the Kebbi Governor, said: The PGF met on Sunday, January 16, 2022 to discuss numerous issues affecting the Forum and members states and we acknowledged some of the achievements the different member states made.\n\n\u201cThe President visited Ogun where he commended and inaugurated projects, he visited Borno State. We have had challenges in some states and we commiserated with them.

President Muhammadu Buhari would unveil the mega pyramid.\n\nOther special guests expected to support the president at the event include the presidents of Benin Republic, Niger Republic, and Chad, as well as governors of Cross River, Ebonyi, Kebbi, Jigawa, Ekiti, and Sokoto states.\n\nRIFAN stated in a publication to announce tomorrow\u2019s programme, \u201cRIFAN will also use the occasion to flag off its 2021 \u2013 2022 Dry Season Farming activities and celebrate the Annual Rice Festival. RIFAN has been the major driver of the rice value chain under the ABP for the past six years. Join us in celebrating rice revolution in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s celebrate President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s initiative on food security and self-sufficiency in rice together with the Governor, CBN, Godwin Emefiele.\u201d\n\nLaunched by Buhari in 2015, ABP is designed to assist small-scale farmers to increase the production and supply of feedstock to agro-processors with the aim of creating an ecosystem that would link out-growers (smallholders) to local processors. The thrust of ABP is the provision of inputs in kind and cash (for farm labour) to smallholder farmers with a view to boosting the production of rice, maize, poultry, sorghum, cassava, tomatoes, cotton, palm oil, soybean, among others. The idea is to stabilise input supply to agro-processors and address the country\u2019s negative balance of payment on food.\n\nIt is also a loan to farmers without collateral and the benefitting farmers are given farm input and cash to cultivate their farms, including the experiment on rice.\n\nAccording to the structure of the ABP, a farmer who wants to repay his loan can either do so with cash or give the central bank his/her produce of same value, after which officials of CBN\u2019s Development Finance Department would sell and recover the loan.\n\nThe programme has increased banks\u2019 finance to the agricultural sector, enhanced capacity utilisation of agricultural firms involved in the production of identified commodities, as well as the productivity and incomes of farmers.\n\nFrom an average yield of 1.8 metric tonnes per hectare in the pre-ABP era, the initiative has increased the country\u2019s average yield per hectare for rice paddy and maize to about five metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nSimilarly, the average capacity utilisation per annum of domestic integrated rice mills has jumped to 90 per cent, from the 30 per cent that was the case in the era preceding the advent of the ABP.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant reduction in the country\u2019s rice import bill, from a monstrous $1.05 billion prior to November 2015, to the current figure of $18.50 million, annually. The programme has also created an estimated 12.3 million direct and indirect jobs across the different value chains and food belts of the country.\n\nNotwithstanding the disruptions caused by the COVID-19, the challenges of insecurity, among others, the Emefiele-led CBN, in collaboration with some state governments, has continued to encourage rice farmers to cultivate the crop and support the federal government\u2019s quest for food security.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

By June last year, our IGR had improved by 131.5 per cent.\n\n\u201cBy November, we had raked in about N85 billion in IGR. This is unprecedented in the history of this state; our state had been number three last year. I\u2019m sure by this year, we will be number two next to Lagos State in Internally Generated Revenue,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAbiodun, who noted that his administration had put in place policies such as deployment of information communication technology to ensure the blockage of leakages in order to increase in the ranking of the state on the Ease of Doing Business Index.\n\nThe governor further disclosed that his administration would continue to provide employment opportunities for the youths so that it could sustain its position as the safest state in the country.\n\n\u201cJust being safe is not just by providing equipment for the police, but by ensuring that youths in the state are well educated and provided with employments,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also informed the gathering that no fewer than 5,000 fibre optic cables were currently being laid across the length and breadth of Ogun to provide WiFi access, adding that his administration would not relent on its infrastructural transformation in the state.\n\nOther measures put in place according to the governor included good road network, friendly business environment and abundant human resources.\n\n\u201cMy advice to other investors is that they should come to Ogun to enjoy the hospitality, infrastructure put in place, availability of land, abundant human resources, friendly tax concession and all that we have done to ease business. If you are not in Ogun, you are not in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are here to see where Proforce can partner with us and how we can support them, how we can also encourage them. We are very proud that this is happening right here in Ogun State. We have seen others from different parts of the world. Definitely, this facility compares to any other anywhere in the world,\u201d he explained.\n\nAbiodun added that the visit was to have a first-hand experience of the firm\u2019s operations and see areas his administration could collaborate and give it the needed support.\n\n\u201cI must say that I am very impressed with what the Chief Executive and his team is doing here. This is a first class manufacturing concern particularly against the background of the level of insecurity that we are witnessing in recent time across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEverything that is happening here is basically to support the law enforcement architecture of the state. Prior to the launch of Operation MESA, my administration will go into discussion with the company to provide the outfit with the needed equipment and logistics to make it carry out its assigned duties effectively.\n\n\u201cToday, Ogun State is one of the safest states in the country and we intend to sustain it, but it is not only by equipment and gadgets to the security agencies. We must understand that there is a nexus between security and illiteracy, unemployment and drug abuse. However, we like to ensure that our law enforcement agencies are properly equipped and battle ready to tackle insecurity\u201d, the governor submitted.\n\nHe, however, reiterated his warning that cultists, criminals and those who engage in any form of violence, unwholesome conducts and vandalism to desist or face the wrath of the law.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court has set aside its earlier ruling which dismissed Guaranty Trust Bank\u2019s (GTB) appeal against a N2.4 billion judgment in favour of Innoson Motors Nigeria Limited.\n\nThe apex court set aside its own decision on Friday, while delivering judgment in an application by GTB seeking the re-listing of the appeal on the grounds that it was wrongly dismissed.\n\nThe apex court in reversing itself relied on Order 8 Rules 16 of the Supreme Court\u2019s rules that empowers it to set aside its decision in certain circumstances, like any other court.\n\nSpecifically, the five-member panel, led by Justice Olukayode Ariwoola in a unanimous decision on Friday, held that the apex court erred in its ruling of February 27, 2019, wherein it erroneously dismissed GTB\u2019s appeal with number: SC/694/2014 against the decision of the Court of Appeal, Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nThe apex court in the lead judgment written by Justice Tijani Abubakar, but read by Justice Abdu Aboki, claimed that it was misled by its Registry, which failed to promptly bring to the notice of the panel that sat on the case on February 27, 2019, that GTB had already filed its appellant\u2019s brief of argument.\n\nThe apex court noted that had the panel that sat on the case on February 27, 2019, notified it of the existence of the appellant\u2019s brief of argument, it would not have given the ruling which dismissed GTB\u2019s appeal on grounds of lack of diligent prosecution.\n\nThe apex court justices explained that the court has powers to reverse itself where there was any reason to do so, especially where any of the parties had obtained judgment by fraud, default or deceit; where such a decision is a nullity or where it is obvious that the court was misled into giving a decision.\n\nAccording to the judgment, the circumstances of the GTB case falls into the category of the rare cases where the Supreme Court could amend or alter its own order on the grounds that the said order or judgment did not present what it intended to record.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that at the material time that the appellant\u2019s appeal was inadvertently dismissed by this court, there was in place, a valid and subsisting brief of argument filed by the applicant.\n\n\u201cIt will be unjust to visit the sin of the court\u2019s Registry on an innocent, vigilant, proactive and diligent litigant.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious from the material before us, that there were errors committed by the Registry of this court, having failed to bring to the notice of the panel of Justices that sat in chambers on February 27, 2019 that the appellant had indeed filed its brief of argument. This is a case deserving of positive consideration by this court.\n\n\u201cHaving gone through all the materials in this application therefore, I am satisfied that the appellant/applicant\u2019s brief of argument was filed before the order of this court made on February 27, 2019 dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe order dismissing the appeal was therefore made in error. It ought not to have been made if all materials were disclosed. The application is therefore, meritorious and hereby succeeds,\u201d the apex court held.\n\nHe proceeded to set aside the court\u2019s ruling of February 27, 2019 dismissing GTB\u2019s appeal and ordered that the appeal marked: 694/2014 \u201cbe relisted to constitute an integral part of the business of this court until its hearing and determination on the merit.\u201d\n\nOther members of the panel were John Okoro and Helen Ogunwumiju.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It has happened to me before,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe students started protesting yesterday after the SUG president was beaten by the thugs. The protest continued today when the president called for mobilisation in front of the gate.\u201d\n\nAnother protester simply identified as Bola said some of the suspected thugs and cultists usually force students to make bank transfers if they have no cash on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to the issue, Adebanjo Adegbenro, the varsity\u2019s spokesman, said what the students embarked on was a sensitisation march and not a protest.\n\n\u201cSometimes, they also robbed them. It is a sensitisation march. We have done all we could to ensure the security of the students,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are also in constant engagement with the community to ensure those things do not fester.

Using your mobile device or phone, simply say, \u201cHey Google, set a reminder\u201d, or \u201cHey Google, remind me to dry clean my children\u2019s uniform at noon tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGoogle Assistant will go on to set a reminder and send you a notification when it is close to the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeat the traffic with Google Maps\n\nYou can get real-time information about traffic jams and delays using Google Maps, helping to plan better routes for school runs.\n\nParents preparing to take their children to school every morning can make use of Google Maps to check for alternative routes and the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) to ensure they get to school before the bell rings.\n\nComplete homework with Google Search\n\nNot all parents are subject matter experts but they do often have to play the role of designated tutor or help out with homework.\n\nIn some cases, parents have forgotten how to solve simple math problems or they may not have the answers to some basic science questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA quick search on Google can help find solutions to difficult questions.\n\nParents should however allow their children to generate the answers to their homework questions before searching Google for the answer.\n\nWatch video tutorials on YouTube\n\nYouTube is great for watching explanatory videos that are fun, informative, and educational.\n\nFor example, parents can watch videos that reveal how to solve a quadratic equation and brush up their knowledge to help their children with their homework.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are also a variety of educational videos for children that can help parents tutor children who wish to learn more beyond their school work.\n\nKeep kids safe with Family Link\n\nChildren today spend more time online than ever before. As such, it is important to help them develop healthy online habits and make sure they are protected from ills such as online predators and cyberbullies.\n\nFamily Link allows parents to set digital rules to help guide their children as they learn and explore online.\n\nThe app helps children make good decisions about what they do on their devices and even shows teacher-recommended apps that can be added to their devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt can be overwhelming for parents to balance their own professional endeavours with the demands of their children\u2019s rigorous education but technology can sometimes help to lighten the load.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "American startup accelerator Y Combinator on Monday, January 10, 2021 announced that it has updated its standard deal for investing in startups, bumping the investment sum from $125,000 to $500,000\u2014still investing $125,000 for a 7% equity stake but now with an additional $375,000 on an uncapped SAFE with Most Favored Nation (MFN) terms.\n\nConsidering that in its 17 years of existence, this is the fourth time the accelerator\u2014which has funded 3,306 startups and 66 African startups\u2014is changing its standard deal, it\u2019s worth looking into what the change means.\n\nInvesting with SAFEs\n\nIntroduced by Y Combinator in late 2013, the SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) is an agreement that gives an investor a future right to own a part of a company (equity).\n\nFor an investor, investing with a SAFE option means putting money into a startup without a set valuation. That is, the investor is providing funding without knowing how much their investment is worth. This is beneficial to founders as they are not pressured early on to give their startups a valuation.\n\nTo protect the investors, SAFEs tend to include a valuation cap\u2014a maximum price at which an investor\u2019s contribution will be converted into equity at the next funding round. This gives investors the right to better terms in a subsequent financing round.\n\nIn the case of YC\u2019s new deal, the accelerator is investing $375,000 at an agreement that it\u2019ll own a future part of a startup. Uncapped means that there\u2019s no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 will be converted to equity. However, the MFN clause implies that instead of fixing a valuation cap, Y Combinator will automatically adopt the lowest cap (or other most favourable terms) issued by another investor the next time the startup raises money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so straightforward, YC is saying that whenever you raise your next round, whatever best terms you get, they\u2019ll match that as the terms for giving you the $375,000,\u201d Zacharias George, Managing Partner at Launch Africa Ventures told TechCabal.\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji, General Partner at Future Africa explained that this new deal makes things simpler as before the $125,000 investment issued by Y Combinator was made up of $25,000 for 6% and 1% for a $10m cap i.e $100,000.\n\n\u201cThe additional $375,000 is at no valuation, it\u2019s at the valuation you get when you\u2019re raising from other investors. Startups pick their next valuation, now there\u2019s no expectation that you make it $10m,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nNotably, the new deal retains Y Combinator\u2019s 4% pro-rata right\u2014a right that is given to an investor allowing them to maintain their initial level of ownership percentage during later financing rounds. This means Y Combinator still has the right to defend 4% of their stake in companies by investing at a follow-up round.\n\nMore money for growth but potential dilution\n\n\u201cNow startups that get into YC have more money to take on serious growth endeavours,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cOne of the issues I\u2019ve had with YC is that $125,000 couldn\u2019t help you in some cases achieve the kind of growth you need to be able to come up on demo day and put up an impressive pitch to get a higher valuation. But with $500,000, there\u2019s a lot you can achieve.\u201d\n\nThe positives are glaring and the announcement is a good move that\u2019s been welcomed by the African startup community. While Hannah Subayi, a board member of the African Business Angel Investors Network (ABAN) agrees with this, she pointed out a potential downside that has been echoed by other investors.\n\nThe MFN clause compels startups to raise at a higher valuation in the next round in order not to give up too much of their ownership to Y Combinator. For instance, if a company raises its next round at a $1 million valuation, the $375,000 investment means that YC gets to own 37.5% of the company!\n\nGeorge believes this isn\u2019t a one-sided affair as Y Combinator\u2019s potential stake could also be heavily diluted if the startup\u2019s next round is at a high valuation. \u201cImagine if the startup raises $10 million at a $100 million valuation, then YC\u2019s $375,000 will be worth just 0.375%,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone familiar with the Nigerian startup space, branded merchandise is often given out as part of the onboarding process or to reward loyal users. Before it became cool, Nigerians frequently used it during naming ceremonies, weddings, and even funerals.\n\nHowever, Oreoluwa Shonibare, Co-founder and CEO of Wiicreate, saw an opportunity to help startups improve their offline marketing campaigns using branded merchandise.\n\nAs a student at Bowen University studying Mass Communication, Public Relations, and Advertising, Shonibare became interested in graphic design. Starting with logos and fliers for students who had events on campus or small businesses looking to create awareness, he soon built a steady list of clients.\n\nDesigning flyers and logos was not all he did, though. He occasionally wrote poetry and soon started putting some of his art on T-shirts. He sold over 100 T-shirts and, in the process, learnt how merchandise could be used to communicate a brand\u2019s value proposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe power of Twitter\n\nAbout to graduate from the university, he saw a tweet from Donald Onwochei, who would later become his first partner. Onwochie was about to start a company and was looking for a co-founder with a graphic design background. Shonibare fit the bill, and he reached out to him.\n\nThis was in 2017, and for a start, they focused on T-shirts, spending time understanding the market and building a sustainable business model. Over the next two years, they designed T-shirts for students and over 30 Nigerian startups, including fintech startups, Cowrywise and PiggyVest.\n\nArmed with more knowledge, they decided to create a product \u2014 Merch box \u2014 in November 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the Wiicreate website\n\n\u201cWe basically help companies curate, ship, and brand merchandise ranging from T-shirts to water bottles, hoodies and thank you cards, just name it. Anything that can help you physically market your brand.\u201d\n\nWith Merch box, Wiicreate has been able to automate the entire process of sourcing, printing, and shipping merchandise for brands and individuals. On the website, users can choose from a wide range of merch options, put in their required quantity, and place their orders.\n\nAssuming the desired merch option is not available, users can place specific requests on the platform. They can choose from three product options \u2013 the starter, classic, and premium pack for \u20a615,000 ($27), \u20a625,000 ($45), and \u20a635,000 ($63), respectively.\n\n\u201cWe handle everything from the design to distribution basically. One thing that we are doing is that we are trying to automate the process and actually just change the way people see the ordering of merchandise.\u201d\n\nFor Shonibare, branded merchandise is capable of communicating a brand\u2019s personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of people say fintechs have very similar brand elements. Everybody uses blue, but when you see a Cowrywise merch, you know it\u2019s a Cowrywise merch. When you see a PiggyVest merch, you know it\u2019s a PiggyVest merch, and it is in the personality of these different brands even though they offer somewhat similar values.\u201d\n\nShonibare reveals that Wiicreate worked with over 100 startups across Africa in 2021, including Mono, Brass, and Thepeer, shipping to five countries and making $200,000 in revenue.\n\nA4 documents everywhere you go\n\nBranded merchandise is not all that Wiicreate does, as the company has recently launched Qwiik, an online printing service for A4 documents. With Qwiik, users can print and have their A4 documents delivered to any part of the country. Shonibare believes that this is the future of cybercafes.\n\n\u201cA4 documents are the most printed and probably the most essential print product in the world because you need A4 documents for basically anything you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch for AfriChange. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cSay you want to fill a form for visa application, you want to get a transcript, you want to send your transcript somewhere, you want to send your account statement; there are just so many use cases. If you want to send your documents to somebody, you don\u2019t have to go to the place. Qwiik is basically what the future of cybercafes looks like.\u201d\n\nThe cost of printing documents on Qwiik is similar to what you\u2019ll get at most cybercafes. Delivery options include same-day delivery, which costs \u20a61,200 ($2), next-day delivery for \u20a6800 ($1.5), and standard delivery (1-3 days) for \u20a6500 ($0.9).\n\nFor a one-page document that I wanted to be delivered to Osun State, the delivery fee was \u20a62,500 ($4) with an estimated delivery time of 1-3 days. In addition to printing documents online, Qwiik also provides PDF tools that let users edit, merge, or delete parts of their documents.\n\nOn challenges and building for the future\n\nBuilding a business usually comes with peculiar challenges, and Shonibare reveals that those that Wiicreate has faced are a bit different from what most Nigerian companies encounter. For starters, while merchandising is not a novel concept in the country, only a few companies have used tech in the way Wiicreate has done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch for Pandar. Source: Twitter\n\nThat means that the company has had to chart its course, discovering unique challenges and adapting to them without any manual. He, however, admits that they have been able to draw inspiration from foreign companies like SwagUp and Canva.\n\nBalancing growth and learning is another area where the startup has faced some challenges, with Shonibare revealing that growth has not always been at the same pace as learning.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019re growing faster than our learning, and some other times, we\u2019re learning faster than we\u2019re growing.\u201d\n\nWith a team strength of about 20, Shonibare reveals that the plan is to become the biggest merchandising company in Africa, working with more startups on the continent and growing revenue to millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe currently have seven unicorns in Africa, and there will be more. Just like we have been able to play our part with 95 startups, we hope to do that for 5,000 startups on the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Apart from the rare acquisition or the glance at funding news headlines, the startup scene was not really my thing.\n\nFast forward a few weeks into my internship, and you\u2019d usually find me on Twitter, doom scrolling Lists and Profiles. On one such occasion, I found WiiCreate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brainchild of Oreoluwa Shonibare and David Onwochie, WiiCreate was founded in 2017 after a tweet by the latter. Onwochie was looking for a co-founder with a graphic design background, and Shonibare fit the bill to a tee.\n\nSince 2017, the company has served over 100 startups across Africa with companies like Cowrywise, Bumpa, Piggyvest, Klasha, among others choosing to throw in their hats with WiiCreate\n\nAlso, WiiCreate currently boasts two products: Merch box and Qwiik. While Merch box helps companies brand, ship and curate merchandise, Qwik allows anyone to send A4 documents anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nLet me explain: Say you are in Lagos and want to apply for a job in Abuja, which requires you to submit your documents physically. All you have to do is go to Qwiik\u2019s website, upload the necessary documents in PDF format, choose how you want them to be printed, fill in the address, and voila, your document is on its way.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m letting too much out of the bag here, but if you are still curious, please watch out for Chimgozirm\u2019s article later today. There\u2019s some inside gist I\u2019m not telling you yet.\n\nMorocco\u2019s digital nation ambitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarrakech. Djemaa el Fna.\n\nCrazy things are happening in Morocco: On Friday, January 14, 2022, Ghita Mezzour, Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of Digital Transition and Administration Reform, announced the launch of the initiative \u201cMoroccoTech.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe not so crazy, but what\u2019s MoroccoTech? According to Mezzour, it is the national brand to promote the Moroccan digital sector. The idea is to position the country as a digital destination of choice internationally while creating a global dynamic that will benefit all Moroccan ecosystems in their digital transformation.\n\nIn 2021, Moroccan startups hit a record-high of $29 million in funding, perhaps an indication of the country\u2019s burgeoning tech ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was worse: In 2017, the Moroccan government sought a $50 million loan from the World Bank to close the funding gap for tech startups and going by this analysis, there was quite a lot wrong with the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a nascent private equity scene to lack of access to credit to restrictive regulations, Morocco\u2019s investment scene required some push. Personally, I\u2019m not sure most African countries were all that different.\n\nAt some point in the country\u2019s recent history, Moroccans could not enjoy the use of WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, or even YouTube.\n\nThe launch of MoroccoTech should hopefully see more Moroccan startup success stories. At least, much better than has been heard in the last few years.\n\nTL;DR: Morocco is looking for outside investments into its tech ecosystem.\n\nWhat you missed last week, maybe\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nThis weekend, I finally listened to/watched Stromae\u2019s Racine Carr\u00e9e concert. All the chills! Also listened to his latest song and I can\u2019t wait for the album to go live. Emphasis on can\u2019t wait.\n\nA lot of people have been quick to cash in on the NFT craze, some in ways you wouldn\u2019t believe. Here\u2019s a restaurant selling memberships through NFTs\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan. Right now, however, I have to settle for videos like this. On a totally unrelated note, I watched this immediately after.\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Build 2021 is this week!!! Register here.

          "title": "Real estate as NFTs, social media in the metaverse: Projections for blockchain in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 9, 2021, Technext held the maiden edition of Technext Coinference, a cryptocurrency and blockchain event, in Lagos, Nigeria. Barely a month later, some of the discussions at the event are becoming very key crypto and blockchain innovations to look out for in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event kicked off with a keynote by the Nigerian Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nEven though the Nigerian government has not been particularly fond of cryptocurrencies, Agba made some interesting comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He mentioned use cases for blockchain that could turn the tides in some sectors of the country.\n\nStoring land as NFTs\n\nThe Minister said blockchain technology \u201copens up numerous possibilities for optimisation in our current systems across industries. And could be the biggest disruptor in finance and governance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting how blockchain could be harnessed to store real estate information, he said, \u201cin real estate and trade, we can harness blockchain to create and store all lands in their base units of a plot as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\u201d\n\nThis could go a long way in tracking the historical ownership of land on the blockchain. People can own lands and list them for sale the same way they own art on OpenSea, Rarible, and other NFT marketplaces.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nA piece of land has to be tokenised, just like artworks, collectables, and music. Information about the land will be included, and it will be uploaded (minted) on a blockchain.\n\nAccording to Finextra, tokenising real estate could also mean that several people can own a property together, giving more people without the financial wherewithal the opportunity to invest in real estate.\n\nOwning real estate outside the country would also be possible. Buying a house in another country could be as easy as shopping online. Once a property is listed on a marketplace with all the necessary information stored on a blockchain, ownership details go to the buyer. And with the help of smart contracts, third parties would not be needed.\n\nWhile these sound very interesting, Agba believes regulation still has to be put in place.\n\n\u201cTo have a fruitful conversation about the regulation of any industry, it is first important to have an understanding of the structure of governance overseeing the industry .\u201d\n\nThis, however, remains a challenge. The Minister said there is the question of who has the power to regulate cryptocurrency, a decision that can only be reached based on how cryptocurrency is classified \u2014 as a security, currency, or an asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto and naira will work together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO and Buchi Okoro, Quidax CEO. Source: Technext\n\nFor a while, there has been a narrative that cryptocurrencies will replace fiat currencies such as the naira and the dollar. However, Buchi Okoro, CEO of crypto exchange, Quidax, doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really had the thought that Bitcoin would replace the naira. I believe that it is supposed to be a collaborative system where crypto works with local currencies to make life better for everybody,\u201d Okoro said.\n\nHe believes fiat currencies will continue to be relevant to finance the same way digital communication will not replace physical communication; they will work together to enhance each other.\n\nOne area crypto will enhance fiat currencies is cross border transactions. This use case has been one of the earliest for cryptocurrencies. A trader in Nigeria, for instance, can swiftly pay his Chinese counterpart with crypto.\n\nOne of the conventional methods of cross border transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Transactions on it take up to four days to be completed. Sending via crypto takes a significantly less amount of time with lower fees.\n\nSocial media is going to the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, NFT, and Web3 were some of the biggest buzzwords of 2021 in the crypto sphere. When social media giant, Facebook, changed its name to Meta, the metaverse got even more attention, and according to Forbes, it is a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.\n\nDuring a panel session at the Technext Coinference, Okoro said, \u201ca lot of engagements that will happen in the future will happen in the metaverse. The things we do on Twitter and Instagram will be done in the metaverse.\u201d\n\nHe added that it will change the way we interact and how we live day-to-day life. Life as we know it could move to a virtual world. Digital platforms already play a vital role in many aspects of human life.\n\nAlthough Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, did not say Meta\u2019s social media platforms will be turned into a metaverse, he did say, \u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.\u201d\n\nLike most innovations, the metaverse is still at the very early stages, and only a few people have experienced it. But with the commercial perks cited by Forbes, more investments could go into the metaverse, and we could subsequently see it go mainstream.\n\nSolana is the blockchain to watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, Patricia CEO. Source: Technext\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, CEO of alternative payments solution company, Patricia, has indicated an interest in the Solana blockchain, which has been touted as the Ethereum killer.\n\nDuring his keynote address titled, Blockchain for Africa: The endless possibilities, Abodje pointed out how blockchain could disrupt African systems making them secure and more effective.\n\nWhen asked about the interesting platforms on which to build blockchain solutions, Abodje unequivocally pointed out Solana, saying it\u2019s one blockchain that should be paid a lot of attention.\n\nSolana is a decentralised blockchain platform founded in 2017. The chain has been praised for its fast transaction speed of over 2000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin that are only capable of about 15 transactions per second.\n\nDespite the rapid transaction speed, the fees are very low, with an average cost per transaction of $000.25.\n\nFast transactions and low fees aren\u2019t the only things that make Solana a blockchain to watch. It brings ease and simplicity to using crypto platforms, reducing the financial barrier of participating in activities such as NFTs and decentralised finance (DeFI).\n\nAfrican NFT project, Afrobubble, was created on the Solana blockchain because of the ease the chain brings to buying and selling NFTs.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, worldwide adoption jumped over 880%, with Nigeria and Kenya among the top ten countries with the highest adoption rate. If this trend continues, we could see some of these projections come true in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "January 2022 when the proposed Lagos Monthly Rent scheme is planned to start is here, yet the enthusiasm that should greet such a scheme remains to be seen. This may be partly because many of the tenants do not have the right information on how the scheme will serve their needs.\n\nBeyond the announcement that tenants in the state would no longer be paying advance rents and that the state government has set aside N5 billion for the scheme, prospective beneficiaries do not know that yearly rent still stays but with much relief.\n\nWhat tenants need to know, according to Debo Adejana, chairman of, Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), South-West zone, is that the state government is going to create a body that would be working with the private sector to implement the scheme.\n\nAdejana, who quotes the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, explains that prospective tenants would be seeking and obtaining a one-year loan from the new body with which they will pay their landlord\u2019s one-year rent, but repays the loan monthly.\n\n\u201cThis is the information that is not available to everybody and I think the government needs to find a way to communicate this well to the people because this is a laudable scheme that, in my view, is the way to go,\u201d he tells BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cWhat the scheme simply means is that somebody is going to pay on behalf of those who need houses to rent but cannot pool together all the money needed for one year\u2019s rent at once,\u201d he states.\n\nRead also: Estates excite investors on security concerns\n\nHe notes that the money to be repaid won\u2019t be the same as the money borrowed as there would be interest and other charges, but because it is the government\u2019s social programme, the charges are not going to be as high as what obtains in an open market.\n\nAnother good side of the scheme, he discloses, is that a portal would be opened where tenants could go to search for rental properties of their choice. The portal would also be open to landlords who might wish to place their properties there for rent.\n\nTenants who are interested in the scheme, which will be starting with the formal sector, must be registered residents of the state and must be up-to-date in their tax obligations to the state.\n\nThe Lagos State government, late last year at the Lagos Real Estate Market Place Conference and Exhibition, announced that it would be implementing a monthly rent scheme starting from January this year.\n\nToke Benson-Awoyinka, a special adviser to the state governor on housing, explained during a discussion on Rental Policies at the event that the new initiative was a social investment scheme initiated by the state government to ease the burden of yearly rent payment on residents.\n\nArguments against the scheme for which the state government said N5 billion had been set aside, are that job security in the country is not guaranteed; there are no government\u2019s alternatives that tenants could resort to, and that the scheme could discourage investment in housing in the state.\n\nBut Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, the state\u2019s commissioner for housing, dismissed these fears, assuring that the government would protect the interest of investors, tenants, and landlords and would guard against payment default or abuse from tenants.\n\n\u201cThere is a system we are working on to make sure that the tenants, landlords, and our private sector partners in this scheme are protected,\u201d the commissioner said at an interactive session with property editors.\n\nContinuing, he assured, \u201caside from talking to the private sector and investors to see how they can help, we are also doing our part alongside our partners who have the same interest because not everyone can buy a house.\u201d\n\nThe monthly rent scheme is part of efforts by the state government to solve its huge housing problem. Lagos is an active rental market where it is estimated that 60 percent of its population live in rented accommodation spending about 50 percent of their income on rent.\n\nApart from its own developments, the state also partners with private sector players, all in an effort to reduce its housing deficit estimated at 3 million units.",

          "text": "A partnership by the Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund (NSSF) and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) to support the vaccination of 1 million Nigerians across six states by January 2022, has delivered over 1.6 million vaccinations surpassing the goal by 60 percent.\n\nThe NSSF was formed through the collaboration between Global Citizen (GC) and the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). It was created to invest in three core COVID-19 response areas: supporting the most vulnerable, strengthening health care systems and re-skilling Nigerian youth for The New Nigeria.\n\nThe NSSF in September 2021 entered into a partnership with the NPHCDA to assist people in Adamawa, Edo, Imo, Katsina, Nasarawa and Ogun to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

          "title": "Pastor Adeboye intervenes as Osun APC crisis gets messier",
          "text": "By Olusesan Laoye\n\nWhen the incumbent governor of Osun State Mr. Gboyega Oyetola perfected his plan to govern Osun State, which is one of the states that is volatile politically, he never knew that things would be, as he has now found them.\n\nAlthough he may have been engaged in Lagos politics from where his cousin Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu brought him to Osun to work with his trusted confidant, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, as the Chief of Staff, apparently to under study him, before taking over the mantle of leadership, he was new to Osun politics and may have discovered too late that things are done differently here.\n\nAt the on set of their journey in Osun State, Oyetola was one of the Lagos boys, brought to Osun to occupy strategic positions which the locals had been promised. Though, left to Aregbesola, Oyetola was not his choice for the position of the Chief of Staff. The man tapped initially is a lawyer known as Akano who mapped out the strategies and movements and contacts on how Aregbesola got into the hearts of the people, before he eventually won the election.\n\nAs a matter of fact, both Aregbesola and Oyetola did not know the nitty- gritty of Osun politics, it was this lawyer, recommended by the former Osun State Governor, Chief Bisi Akande that made their navigation in Osun politics easy. Impressed by his performance, Akande and others agreed that this lawyer would be Aregbesola\u2019s Chief of Staff but Tinubu\u2019s interest for his cousin, Oyetola, changed the whole plan.\n\nThat was the beginning of the sidelining of Aregbesola\u2019 men by Tinubu in favour of Oyetola, which people thought just happened when Oyetola got to office. Again, that was the beginning of the animosities between Aregbesola and Oyetola.\n\nAs the Chief of staff, it was alleged that Oyetola at a stage, was too powerful for Aregbesola to control, fearing not to offend his former boss who paved the way for him to rule Osun State. But it became known that as time went by, he got himself out of the hook and he too, became autocratic, which Oyetola did not like.\n\nWhat reportedly escalated this unending Imbroglio between the duo, was during the election that brought Oyetola into governance, when like in the chief of staff\u2019s case, Aregbesola had another person in mind for the governorship, but he was still over ruled by Tinubu.\n\nThis, it was said, did not go down well with Oyetola and it also heightened his sharp reaction in dismantling the structures put in place by Aregbesola, immediately he got to office. It was argued that the animosities which had built up, informed Oyetola\u2019s jettisoning all known loyalists of Aregbesola, relegated them to the background, as he did everything to assert his authority as the governor of the state.\n\nOyetola also dismantled and weakened the State executive of the APC in place while Aregbesola was there, and was in control. This eventually, led to the leadership crisis between him and Aregbesola and finally bursted the patched relationship.\n\nAt the early stage of Oyetola\u2019s government, both were pretending that all was well, until bubble burst and the whole crisis came out in the open.\n\nBoth Chiefs Bisi Akande and Bola Tinubu at different times, tried to settle them, but all to no avail. What however irritated and infuriated Aregbesola more, according to our source, is the intimacy and cordial relationship now existing between Oyetola and the former Deputy Governor of the State, and erstwhile Chairman of the Senate committee on appropriation, Senator Iyiola Omisore, who contested the governorship for the third times, in the last governorship election, under the Social Democratic Party, (SDP).\n\nThe issue of Omisore and Oyetola was said to have angered Aregbesola who felt he was deceived by his former COS, who had told them that he did not have anything to do with Omisore. They later got to know that he and Omisore had gone into an agreement, during the re-run of 2018, governorship election.\n\nIt was further argued that their agreement centered on dismantling, Aregbesola\u2019s structure and programmes.\n\nA source close to Aregbesola\u2019s camp told Businesshallmark that when the interior Minister got to know about Omisore and Oyetola, he got furious and swore never to trust or have anything to do with the duo.\n\nTrue to his secrete agreement with Omisore, Oyetola dismantled the controversial education arrangements of Aregbesola, particularly the common uniform for schools in the State, merger of schools and other programmes which were in the manifesto of Omisore\u201ds SDP.\n\nAregbesola without hiding his feelings declared during the registration exercise of members, when Omisore formally joined the APC, that he and his groups would have nothing to do with those who murdered the former Attorney General of the Federation, Chief Bola Ige, which was glaring that he was apparently referring to Omisore, who had been cleared of the crime by the Appeal Court.\n\nAs things were, it appears that with the formation of the Progressive Top, which comprises all the aggrieved loyalists of Aregbesola, the battle line has now been drawn between Aregbesola and his former COS. The battle is now tense as the Progressives Top during both the wards, local and State congresses had it\u2019s own parallel excos.\n\nThe Top is determined that Oyetola would not get the ticket of the party and if he eventually did, there were strong situations that the group with its wide tentacles and structure across the state, will not work for him, but rather work for someone else.\n\nWhat made the matter in APC worse In the past few weeks, is the teaming up of the former Secretary to the Government, SSG, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Hon. Lasun Yusuf, and the the Ex Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Hon Najeem Salami with the Progressives Top of Aregbesola.\n\nThe three politicians no doubt, have shown that they are not ready to welcome Oyetola for a second term but would prefer some one from the Top, to emerge as the flag the bearer of the APC.\n\nWith the present situation on ground, and since the elders of the party could not work out amicable settlement, some members of the party within the State and outside it, have been making frantic steps to settle the matter, so as not to give the opportunity for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to take over the state.\n\nPart of their arrangement was their visit and appeal to the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye, who is also an indigene of Osun State, to wade into the matter.\n\nThey believed that the intervention of Adeboye, would go a long way to settle the rifts, as both principals in the crisis would not want to ignore or disobey Pastor Adeboye who is highly respected.\n\nAlthough some of the Pastor\u2019s aides have warned that their GO should not be drawn into political crisis, it was not clear whether he has actually intervened or not. But the situation is still the same.\n\nAlso the the National reconciliatory committee of the APC chaired by the former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, going round the State to reconcile aggrieved members on the fallout of the last congresses, which bred parallel executives in the affected States, was in Osun state at the weekend, to wade into the matter as well.",
          "summary": "At the on set of their journey in Osun State, Oyetola was one of the Lagos boys, brought to Osun to occupy strategic positions which the locals had been promised.\nThough, left to Aregbesola, Oyetola was not his choice for the position of the Chief of Staff.\nAs a matter of fact, both Aregbesola and Oyetola did not know the nitty- gritty of Osun politics, it was this lawyer, recommended by the former Osun State Governor, Chief Bisi Akande that made their navigation in Osun politics easy.\nLasun Yusuf, and the the Ex Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Hon Najeem Salami with the Progressives Top of Aregbesola.\nPart of their arrangement was their visit and appeal to the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye, who is also an indigene of Osun State, to wade into the matter.",

          "title": "Continuous borrowing: Nigeria in dire straits",
          "text": "For those expecting considerable economic reprieve for Nigeria and Nigerians in 2022, they are better advised to be more pragmatic. This is because, with an already scheduled N6.123trillion budget deficit in 2022, Nigeria is sure to continue on a borrowing binge.\n\nThe implication is that the Federal government will borrow more money both from internal and external sources to fill the financial gaps.\n\nAlready the government has accumulated a total debt stock of about N28 trillion in the last six years. According to the Debt Management office, Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock stood at N38.004trillion in September 30, 2021 while the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)has outlined that Nigeria will borrow a further N14.8 Trillion between 2022 and 2024. According to the document, the projected figure for 2022 stands at N4.89 Trillion. This is further broken into domestic borrowing of N2.44 Trillion and N2.44 Trillion for foreign borrowing.\n\nFurther details show that the borrowing schedule in the three years will increase the public debt of the country from the current figure of N38 Trillion to N52.8 Trillion by 2024 with total domestic debt at N29.91 trillion and total external debt at N23.05 Trillion. Figures on the document also revealed that between 2022 and 2024, Nigeria will spend N14.6 Trillion on debt servicing. This is broken down as; N3.6 Trillion in 2022, N4.9 Trillion in 2023, and N6.1 Trillion in 2024. Debt service figures will increase by 36.1% between 2022 and 2023 and by 24.4% in 2023 and 2024.\n\nDuring the same period, the debt service to revenue ratio is projected at 43% in 2022, 48% in 2023, and 57% in 2024. Many worry however that these projections can only work on paper.\n\nExperts explain that public debt is how much a country owes to lenders outside of itself. These can include individuals, businesses, and even other governments. The term \u201cpublic debt\u201d is often used interchangeably with the term sovereign debt.\n\nPublic debt according to them usually only refers to national debt. Some countries also include the debt owed by states, provinces, and municipalities. Therefore, it is important to be mindful when comparing public debt between countries to make sure the definitions are the same.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ballooning debt profile has raised major concerns from various stakeholders. The last time Business Hallmark researched the subject it emerged that Nigeria already owed N38trillion ( $96.39billion) and nurses plans to borrow more. That is what the federal Government said at the time: FG feels convinced that since its debt-to-GDP ratio was still below 25% per cent, it still has a lot of room to accommodate more debts.\n\nAn expert who wouldn\u2019t want to be mentioned said Governments tends to take on too much debt because the benefits make them popular with voters. Increasing the debt allows government leaders to increase spending without raising taxes. Investors usually measure the level of risk by comparing debt to a country\u2019s total economic output, known as gross domestic product (GDP). The debt- to -GDP ratio gives an indication of how likely the country can pay off its debt.\n\nThere is a consensus that the level of debt that an economy can bear depends on numerous factors: the economy\u2019s expected rate of economic growth; whether domestic or foreign borrowers, or domestic government institutions, own debt; the country\u2019s fiscal capacity; inflationary expectations; currency risk; and default risk. While it easy to determine where Nigeria ranks in this parameter now given the new budget, both local and international communities are aware that the country economy is very weak in every standard measurement. However, Nigeria\u2019s debt to Gross Domestic Product may look good, but analysts believe that the devil is in the details of debt to revenue and servicing.\n\nRecently, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, advised President Muhammadu Buhari to reduce borrowing from external lending houses to fund the country\u2019s annual budgets. He said the administration should, instead, focus on blocking financial leakages and avoiding wastage in all tiers of government. Lawan declared these in Abuja in a chat with newsmen after a closed-door meeting with Buhari at the State House.\n\nThe senate president expressed a view that is centred on the need to take steps to increase revenue generation by government agencies and reduce dependence on external loans to fund the budget.\n\n\u201cSo, if there are areas that we can now get revenues that will help us reduce the amount of borrowing, then, so be it. And this is something that we all agreed with Mr. President, that we should continue to look at those areas that we need to improve on revenue generation and collection.\u201d\n\nChief Executive Officer, CEO, Financial Derivatives Company (FDC), Bismarck Rewane, who showed discomfort with the level of borrowing advised FG to adopt the model of project-specific borrowing, in order to guard against reckless borrowing and jeopardizing the economy.\n\n\u2018\u2019But having said that, the growth in the level of debt is something of concern because the debts are liabilities. You also have to focus on the assets. What are the assets that are being acquired? How much of it is for consumption and how much of it is for Gross Capital Formation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2019But the good news is that, the projection for our productivity or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2022 is 3% higher, than the 2.5% for this year, and in 2023 the projection is 2.9%. So it means some projects, not necessarily because of this borrowing, some of the projects for which borrowing was done in the last two to three years will begin to have their impact on output and employment in 2022 and 2023,\u201d Rewane had also said.\n\nDr. Ayo Teriba, an economist and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Economic Associates (EA),had raised similar alarms last week, saying the country\u2019s debt profile was not sustainable.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is not clear what we should make of the well established fact that interest payments on debt are perennially consuming nearly 100 per cent of revenue available to the Federal Government of Nigeria. There is currently no consensus on the way forward,\u2019\u2019 said Teriba.\n\nUnfortunately, the debt trap is compounding the huge challenges of the country ranging from high unemployment at over 33%, unemployment at above 22%, the ravaging effect of Covid -19 pandemic which latest variant is Omicron.\n\nThese days almost everybody is aware that Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world, after overtaking India with over 100 million people in poverty. The Naira which sold at N220/$ in June 15, 2015 has depreciated by about 100 per cent to N565/$ this January 2022, while Foreign Direct Investment (-74.0% y/y to USD107.81 million) remained below its 12-quarter moving average (USD240.22 million).\n\nThe major revenue earner for the country, crude oil price, which has hit $75 pbd and above presently still fluctuates.\n\nAt the same time, insecurity has not only hobbled agriculture, many parts of Northern Nigeria have been taken over by bandits such that not much business activities can subsist. The World Bank just noted that Nigeria\u2019s revenue to GDP ratio hovered between five and six per cent last year and remains the lowest in the world. It\u2019s clearly a long climb to freedom and prosperity for Africa\u2019s most populous nation and largest economy.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "title": "Fiscal, monetary policy conflicts threaten economic recovery",
          "text": "By Uche Chris\n\nThe increasing policy difference between the fiscal and monetary authorities in the management of the economy since 2015 has become the main obstacle hindering the full recovery from the problems buffeting the country, which has suffered two recessions in the past six years of this administration.\n\nExperts believe that the worsening economic fortunes of Nigerians is caused primarily by the defective and inflationary policies of the government, which made its management and control near impossible. Such policies impinge negatively on macroeconomic stability.\n\nOne of such policy conflicts militating economic recovery is the federal government\u2019s excessive borrowings from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, through the Ways and Means Advances may have become the single most adverse factor impeding the performance of the CBN, and worsening the economic crisis in the country.\n\nThis was disclosed in the Monetary Policy category of the CBN Frequently Asked Questions, FAQs, under the title, \u201cCan government frustrate CBN policy\u201d? It was stated that there are certain distortions in the Monetary policy base due to the over dependence of the government on the CBN on deficit financing.\n\nIn the document, MPC, lamented that the growing lending by the CBN to finance government deficit budget, though statutory, is directly undermining its ability to implement price stability measures to reverse the economic down turn in the country.\n\n\u201cYes, when the federal government exceeds its revenue, the CBN finances government deficit through Ways and Means Advances subject to a certain limit.\u201d\n\nIn the existing laws. One of such regulations or laws which the government has routinely disregarded, is the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which sets a limit to the level of borrowings by government.\n\nAlso, Section 38(I) of the CBN Act, 2007, states that the \u201cBank may offer temporary advances to the government to cover the deficiency of the budget revenue at such set rate of interest as the Bank may determine. The total amount shall not at any time exceed five percent of previous year\u2019s actual revenue of government.\u201d\n\nThe direct consequences of depending on the CBN to fund its deficits create distortions in macroeconomic instability because of excessive liquidity. Ways and Means is a loan by the CBN to finance government during temporary budget shortfalls subject to the limit imposed by law.\n\nFitch, a rating agency, had in January 2021, raised concern over government continued recourse to Ways and Means to fund its growing deficits. The agency said that the Bank financing of government could pose serious macroeconomic stability risks in the context of weak institutional safeguards that pressure the credibility of policy making and the ability of CBN to the control inflation.\n\nIt was this habit that forced Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state, to raise the alarm in April 2021, over the borrowing from the CBN to fund the Federation Account, exceeding the five percent limit, which is used to fund the Federal Account Allocation Committee, FAAC, shared monthly by the three tiers of government in the country.\n\nAccording to him, government was borrowing from the CBN to fund the FAAC due to revenue shortfalls arising from the Covid pandemic, which took the economy into a second recession in three years, as oil price, the may stay of the economy, plunged.\n\nThe Ways and Means borrowings are mainly for budget support of the three tiers of government.Since 2015, most of the state government have been under intense fiscal pressures as revenue from the FAAC has continued to dwindle, putting in jeopardy all their development programmes, and even payment of salaries.\n\nFor instance, Kaduna state had to lay off workers as a result of spending about 93 percent of its monthly revenue of N3.6 billion on salaries alone, leaving only as little as N300 million for other programmes and services. This has also gingered state governments to take serious steps to boost in internally generated revenues.\n\nAlready, the CBN has extended to government about N15.5 trillion funding, which is not part of government public debt standing at N38 trillion by September 2021, and expected to rise to over N43 trillion by the end of 2022.\n\nIn a 2022 economic review and projections\u2019 presentation organized by First Bank of Nigeria, FBN, last week, renowned economist and chairman of Financial Derivatives Company, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, said deficit spending and excessive borrowing may produce a picture of stability and growth, but unless there is sufficient productivity, it will only defer the doomsday, which will soon arrive, because every debt has to be repaid and the time of repayment is most difficult without adequate revenue generation.\n\nAccording to him, most of the borrowing by government is to finance deficit budget, which is basically used to fund recurrent expenditure, but the size of the budget does not really matter and may be deceptive because when inflation and deficit are discounted, the size and impact pale in significance.\n\n\u201cNigeria operates a federal and states\u2019 structure and the federal budget of N17 trillion is only a part of it; the 36 states may also budget N14 trillion, which amounts to a total of about N30 trillion, which is just 10 percent of GDP. Given its size and resources, Nigeria can do better to improve its standard of economic performance.\u201d\n\nAnother area of policy conflict is the recently tax regime introduced by the government, which is likely to disrupt CBN\u2019s intervention efforts to ensure economic recovery, as many businesses may be impacted adversely. At the end of 2021, the CBN had injected.\n\nMr. Paul Alaje, senior economist, SPM Professional, said, that the budget may raise more tax revenues for government but how do the taxes translate to jobs. \u201cWhat should concern us most is how the budget will create jobs. The new taxes are reflected in the capital expenditure, which is still less than 30 percent, and this is what crate jobs.\n\n\u201cTo raise taxes for recurrent expenditure is to further restrict economic growth and increase poverty and unemployment. This government has had a deplorable performance with capital expenditure since 2016, while at the same raising recurrent expenditure to almost 100 percent of revenue. This is the last budget the president will fully implement and it does not look it will change much.\u201d\n\nHe said the tax policy is wrong, because unemployment, at 33 percent, is high, and 80 million people living below poverty line. When people are not working, he argued, how would be able to pay tax; \u201cso what we need to increase is the tax bracket of the people paying tax, rather than raising the tax rate. Increasing the tax bracket requires putting people to work, which more and higher taxes will discourage.\u201d\n\nDr. Godwin Owoh, an economist and policy expert, dismissed the whole assumptions behind the budget and government fiscal policies, insisting the budget cannot be relied on to achieve those projections because the underlying facts are fraudulent and grossly mistaken; and the borrowings are simply for consumption.\n\n\u201cThere are no reliable figures with which to properly bench mark the budget and its performance; the GDP is a fraction of the national GDP, because it only reflects the federal output without reference to the states.\n\n\u201cAll those macroeconomic aggregates are negative in real terms because three quarter of the nation\u2019s economy is inactive; when unemployment is high as we have and people are poor, production cannot take place; so where is growth coming from. The economy is on auto pilot in a crashing plane\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "The governor of Yobe State, Hon. Mai Mala Buni, on Sunday, praised President Muhammadu Buhari for his untiring efforts at restoring peace and normalcy particularly to the troubled north-eastern part of the country.\n\nBuni acknowledged that there is now a significant improvement in the security situation in the North-East particularly in Yobe State.\n\nThe Yobe governor also commended the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. for providing the right leadership at the National Assembly and for providing the much needed support and cooperation to enable the executive arm of government perform.\n\nBuni spoke at the 2022 Annual Machina Cultural Festival which started on Monday and ended on Sunday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuni said the large and peaceful congregation that witnessed the cultural festival was an evidence that the security situation had improved.\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for providing the security personnel the required resources to secure lives and property in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, the people in the north eastern part of the country can now sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cIn case there is still anybody in doubt, this large congregation at this event is enough proof that the security situation has improved,\u201d Buni said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuni also thanked the traditional rulers, other community leaders and Imams for their prayers which, from evidence, had been answered by God.\n\nGovernor Buni also made glowing remarks about the Senate President for leading a legislative arm which provided cooperation and support needed for the executive arm to deliver on its mandate to the people.\n\nHe said the various projects that the government had executed or are now being implemented were the results of the cooperation and support which once eluded the Buhari\u2019s administration the first four years but are now being provided by the current Assembly.\n\n\u201cI have earlier acknowledged Ahmad Lawan as Sardaunan Bade. He is not Sardaunan Bade alone but Sardaunan of Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe was voted here as a Senator because this is his constituency. But God has made him Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u201cSince he assumed office as Senate President, the support and cooperation that he gives the executive arm of government led by President Muhammadu Buhari has brought about the development in the country that we are witnessing today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat cooperation and support by the current National Assembly is what is responsible for the development we are seeing today in Nigeria because the first four years of President Buhari, he did not enjoy this kind of cooperation and support by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is why we are seeing projects of national and rural development and the likes and these projects will get to you here very soon,\u201d Buni said.\n\nBesides Lawan and Buni, governors of Jigawa State, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and Kebbi State, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu were also at Machina to witness the cultural festival.\n\nLawan and the three governors were all honoured with chieftaincy titles by the chief host, the Emir of Machina, HRH Alhaji Dr. Bashir Albishir Bukar Machinama.\n\nThe Machina Paramount ruler gave Lawan letter of appointment as the Danmasani Machina.\n\nLawan was once Danmasani Bade but having been elevated by the Bade Emirate Council in Yobe State as Sardaunan Bade, his first son, Ibrahim Ahmad Lawan now bears the title.\n\nBuni received a letter of appointment as Zanna Gargamma, Jigawa State Governor as Dugajin Machina and Kebbi State Governor as Dan Maliki Machina.\n\nThe week-long activities which became an annual event in 2006 were rounded off on Sunday with grand Durban which was a beautiful display of horsemanship and led by the Machina Paramount ruler himself, HRH Alhaji Dr. Bashir Albishir Bukar.\n\nThe colourful event was also witnessed by the Shehu of Borno, HRH. Alhaji Abubakar Umar Garbai Ibn Al-Kanemi.",

But a lot of work still needs to be done.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cKpofire is not the only pollutant and so individually and collectively what are we doing, especially corporate organizations to reduce unwanted emissions into our environment?\u201d\n\nDikio also urged people of the Niger Delta to stop bickering over the alloted percentage for host communities in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, saying opportunity would be created for future negotiation.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will say that instead of quarreling about the percentage, we should be talking about what to do with the percentage we got, build on it and we can have another discussion after that.\u201d\n\nWhile reinforcing the PAP\u2019s Train, Employ and Mentor (TEM) model, Dikio said in the next 10 years, the Niger Delta should have a critical mass that would make people of the region competitive in all spheres.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for partnership with businesses that can train these ex-agitators and give them the required skills for employment in their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe in PAP will pay for the training. Its a partnership because we want those who train them to guarantee that they will employ them.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this which is a departure from the old model which only train people and put them back in the bloated unemployment market. We feel that is a waste of money and everybody\u2019s time. It increases the anxiety level in the economy and the polity.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the chief host, King Alfred Diette-Spiff, said the game of Polo was catching up in the South-South, noting that contrary to what many people thought, Polo was no longer an elite game.",

The challenges are temporary and the challenges are that of leadership.\n\n\u201cIf I am to focus on the economy as I did say before, I will focus the economy on the contemporary world direction- manufacturing, talent and innovation, science and technology.\u201d\n\nHe explained that if elected, his administration will create an environment that will enable jobs to multiply.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIf you elevate talent and innovation, then all you need to do is simply create the infrastructure for innovation and support new startup business, then just concentrate on what will create jobs on its own.\n\n\u201cSupport the younger ones in setting up their own businesses in such a manner that they don\u2019t need to wait for government employment and once they create their own businesses, they will be in the position to employ others.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of private sector employment is that it is, more efficient, it is more rewarding in terms of payment of salaries and it is more productive.\n\n\u201cSo, I will focus on those things that will create an economic environment that will encourage talented Nigerians to deploy their talents and eventually focus on innovation that will fit into the fourth industrial revolution that is already here with us.\n\n\u201cI want to believe that will help get us out of the issue of borrowing to pay salaries, borrowing to pay the recurrent expenditure. I want to believe that my economic direction will actually shift from where we are today, to a new direction of the world economy.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Ohanaeze Ndigbo on Monday reached out to the north in an apparent move to solicit support for the 2023 presidential race, saying that Igbo believe in dialogue and negotiation to produce the President of south eastern extraction.\n\nThis was even as the Ohanaeze disclosed that Igbo in diaspora have set aside N10 billion naira to support any candidate of Igbo extraction that will emerge for the presidential race.\n\nSpeaking at a meeting with the national President of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Yerima Shettima, Secretary General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Worldwide, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro said he was in Kaduna with delegation to beg northerners to support Igbo to get the 2023 presidency.\n\nMazi Isiguzoro also disclosed that the delegation had met with some religious Clerics in the north over the presidential project.\n\nHe said the Igbo delegation for 2023 presidency would continue to lobby all parts of the country for the power shift to the South East region.\n\nHe informed that Igbo nation including their kinsmen in Rivers and Delta States have abundant human resources that can produce the best for the Presidency.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Scribe pointed at politicians like Rotimi Amaechi, Peter Obi, amongst others as presidential materials.\n\n\u201cWe are begging the north to give us the opportunity. You should help us because we know that the north plays the role of kingmaker in politics of this country. We are here to ask you to support an Igbo man for the presidency. There should be no more abusive words between north and south East as we used to read on pages of newspapers.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the cordial relationship between Zik and Tafa Balewa, what happened to the good relationship between North and South East? We must bring back the good memories of old days for the unity and development of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIgbo have one trillion investment in the north. We are for one Nigeria, we are not for Biafra. We need somebody that is of age that can unite Nigeria. We believe in one Nigeria. We have abundant human resources that can take over from Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are committed to serve Nigeria. We have seven States including Rivers and Delta States where we have Igbo speaking brothers. We have politicians like Rotimi Amaechi, Peter Obi, Rochas Okorocha, among others that can run for the presidency\u201d. Mazi Isiguzoro said.\n\nResponding, Yerima Shettima told the Ohanaeze delegation that it was good to negotiate when seeking for power, adding that nobody achieved good thing through threat.\n\n\u201cI have always believed in Pan Nigeria. I believe in the unity of one Nigeria. I have been part of many struggles. I am not happy that Nigeria is not where it is. People who don\u2019t have an idea of history of Nigeria resorted to abusive words and threat. They resort to champion the cause of Biafra. Gone are those days you use threat to look for power.\n\n\u201cIt is a welcome development that you are here to discuss the 2023 general election. Politics is about negotiation. You need to rise above board. Nobody will trust power to you if you resort to threat.\n\n\u201cHowever, democratically I don\u2019t understand what zoning means. I believe that you should bring out your candidate and we will bring out our own, and by the time we meet at the contest, whoever wins, should carry the day. Nevertheless, we will go back to our elders and report to them about your visit and mission\u201d. Shettima said.",

          "text": "With barely one year to the 2023 general elections, Nigerians have continued to express worry over the continued delay in the signing of the Electoral Act 2010 Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nMore than any other thing, the delay has kept the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) waiting and guessing on how best to plan ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in December last year, refused assent to the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment ) Bill 2021 passed by both Chambers of the National Assembly on account of mandatory provision of direct primaries for political parties in choice of candidates for general election as contained in section 87(2) of the rejected bill .\n\nIn the letter of refusal of assent dated December 13, 2021, the president said the provision was undemocratic and also a serious infraction on Constitution of the various political parties which offers various options of direct, indirect and consensus arrangement for such elections.\n\nCSOs\n\nReacting to the delay in a joint position Monday, the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) said the Bill reflects the wishes of Nigerians and key electoral stakeholders for a legal framework that promotes the use of technology and other innovations to stem electoral manipulation, strengthen INEC\u2019s financial independence, and empowers the Commission to reject falsified election results.\n\nBesides, they said further delay to conclude work on amendment process is also inimical to the preparations for Ekiti and Osun off-cycle governorship elections and the 2023 general elections.\n\nThey spoke at a joint press conference Monday in Abuja on the need for the National Assembly to act on the Bill with dispatch upon resumption from recess.\n\nThe CSOs comprised Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS), Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF) and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nOther CSOs in attendance include the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organizations (NNNGO) and Inclusive Friends Association (IFA).\n\nSpeaking at the event, Board member, Yiaga Africa, Ezenwa Nwangwu, said a new legal framework is central to the integrity of 2023 General elections, future elections and the advancement of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nNwangwu emphasised the imperative of a speedy enactment of the Bill to strengthen the Electoral legal framework.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is required to facilitate early preparations for the 2023 general elections and to eschew legal uncertainties that make the electoral process susceptible to manipulation.\u201d\n\nThe activist said \u201cthe opportunity to test the operability of the new legislation and functionality of the new innovations will be lost if the amendment process is not concluded expeditiously.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, with only 398 days to the 2023 general election, it is crucial for the National Assembly and President to conclude the electoral amendment process by 31 January 2022.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should remove the contentious clause of direct primaries, resolve all the identified drafting errors and cross-referencing gaps and re-transmit the bill to the President for assent within a week of resumption,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Executive Director International Press Centre (IPC) Lanre Arogundade said as the nation awaits the resumption of the National Assembly Tuesday 18 January 2022, Nigerians expect that work on the Electoral Amendment Bill would be the priority issue on the order paper.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the National Assembly should therefore conclude this process as any further delay will undermine public confidence in the reform process.\n\n\u201cThe Senate and House of Representatives should upon resumption on Tuesday, 18 January, 2022, take legislative action at its first sitting to conclude the process and re-transmit the Bill to President Buhari by Friday, January 21, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should ensure proper scrutiny of the bill to resolve all drafting errors and cross-referencing gaps before re-transmitting the bill for Presidential Assent.\n\n\u201cCivil society groups, media, and development partners sustain the effort to safeguard the Electoral Bill from policy capture, manipulation, and subversion of the people\u2019s will,\u201d Arogundade further said.\n\nSAN rules out fear\n\nWhile commenting on the development in an exclusive interview with Blueprint, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ahmed Raji, said there should be no cause for alarm over the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not nursing any fear. Well, if there is no amendment, then we can use the old law, I think there is no problem. Have we not been having bye elections before now? So what is the matter this time?\n\n\u201cI think they will resolve it. I also don\u2019t think vetoing Mr President is the best thing to do.\n\n\u201cThey said they want direct primary, so what?\u201d\n\nAPC\n\nIn a reaction, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) expressed support for the president on the issue, saying it expects same of its lawmakers in the National Assembly.\n\nNational Secretary APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Senator John James Akpanudoedehe stated this Monday in a chat with Blueprint.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy convention, I am not supposed to make comments about the Senate openly because I am a former Senator. You do not expect me to start castigating anyone when we have a channel of communication.\n\n\u201cTwo, the party is expected to stand behind the President and we expect all our members, including lawmakers, to do that. That is what is meant by party supremacy.\u201d\n\nPDP govs\n\nIn a position at the end of their meeting in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Monday charged the National Assembly to delete areas of complaints in Electoral Act Amendment Bill, noting that an early concluded electoral act is vital to credible elections.\n\nAs contained in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by 11 of the PDP governors, the meeting once again reviewed the state of the states and the state of the nation.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 reads: \u201cThe PDP Governors congratulated the entire PDP family for conducting a smooth and credible National Convention that led to the emergence of the highly acclaimed Dr. Iyorchia Ayu-led National Executive Committee and commended the new PDP NWC for hitting the ground running with respect to repositioning the PDP into a credible vehicle for rescuing and rebuilding Nigeria which has been battered by bad economy, insecurity, unemployment and other social ills by the incompetent and inept APC Administration.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors requested the National Assembly to quickly conclude deliberations on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill either by overriding Mr. President\u2019s veto or deleting areas of complaints.\n\n\u201cThe meeting advised that the option of sustaining Mr. President\u2019s veto would lead to a quicker resolution and would deny Mr. President the opportunity to once again truncate a reformed Electoral jurisprudence for Nigeria. An early concluded Electoral Act is vital for credible elections.\n\n\u201cThe meeting lamented the continued state of insecurity in the country, the persistent and ceaseless flow of Nigerians\u2019 blood on a daily basis in many parts of Nigeria, the near collapse of the security situation in Nigeria. The strategy to confront terrorists, kidnappers, bandits and other criminals is still a major problem of the APC administration.\u201d\n\nNASS\n\nBut speaking ahead of Senate resumption of plenary Tuesday, Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi (APC Kebbi North) declared Monday that the rejected clause 87 of the Electoral Bill by President Buhari would be reviewed in line with opinions of constituents.\n\nFielding questions from journalists in his office on what would be the next line of action by the Senate on the contentious provision, the Senate Leader said aggregate opinions of constituents already gathered by each of the senator would determine the decision of the Senate.\n\n\u201cSenators have consulted with their constituents and the outcome of their discussions will be reflected during debate on the floor of the Senate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker said the Senate would also interact with the House of Representatives for common position on the clause.\n\n\u201cSince no single chamber can take decision on such an issue , as declared by the President of the Senate , Ahmad Lawan , last year , both chambers shall collaborate for harmonisation of position on the contentious clause.\n\n\u201cWhatever position that would be taken on the controversial electoral bill would be in line with the provision of the 1999 Constitution as amended\u201d, he stressed.\n\nWhen probed further, he said he cannot predict what the final decision of lawmakers would be on the electoral bill.\n\nAside Electoral Bill, the leader added that report on Constitution review exercise carried out separately by Ad-hoc Committees set up to that effect by both chambers, would also be considered in meeting up with time for such legislation.\n\nOn security challenges facing the country, Senate Leader Yahaya commended Buhari for approving the declaration of bandits as terrorists, which according to him, vindicated the Senate\u2019 s resolution to that effect November last year.\n\nINEC\n\nMeanwhile, the INEC has expressed its desire to have the new Electoral Act 2021 Amendment Bill signed into law at the earliest possible time.\n\nHowever, the commission said, in event the Bill was not signed, it would have to rely on the extant laws of the land- The Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to conduct the elections.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, stated this Monday in a chat with Blueprint.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the area(s) of disagreement between the Presidency and the National Assembly on the Bill would be resolved quickly.\n\n\u201cIt is the Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s (INEC) desire that the new Electoral Act Amendment Bill is signed into Law at the earliest possible time.\n\n\u201cThis will give the commission enough time to plan for the 2023 General Election as well as other off cycle elections. It will also enable the commission to update its regulations and guidelines.\n\n\u201cThere are many good things in the new Bill that would, without doubt, assist the commission to further improve the conduct of election and the electoral system.\n\n\u201cWe do hope that the area (s) of disagreement between the Presidency and the National Assembly over the Bill will be resolved quickly.\n\n\u201cHowever, if eventually, the bill is not signed, the implication is that the Commission would have to rely on the current laws-The Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and the 1999 Constitution (as amended) to conduct the elections.\u201d\n\nIn a similar reaction, Director Information and Voter Education INEC, Ayo Victor Aluko, said the commission would not speculate or pre-empt the National Assembly on this controversy.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are waiting for the legislature the executive to finish their jobs so as to do our job. However, the commission will rely on existing relevant laws to do our job if eventually the Electoral Act Amendment bill was not signed into law. We cannot speculate or pre-empt the two arms of government.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Government has again filed amended charges against the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe amended 15-count charge bordering on acts of terrorism was filed on Friday last week at the Federal High Court in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nChannels Television got a copy of the charge sheet on Monday. It was signed by the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation, MB Abubakar, on behalf of the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Files Amended Terrorism Charge Against Nnamdi Kanu\n\nCount One of the charge read, \u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, Male, Adult, of Afatanukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State sometimes in 2021 being a member and leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a proscribed Organisation, did commit an act in furtherance of an act of Terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the People of Nigeria by making a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, with intent to intimidate the population and you threatened that people will die, the whole world will stand still and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1(2)(b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you Nnamdi Kanu, Male, Adult, of Afatanukwu Ibeku, Umuahia North Local Government Area of Abia State on diverse dates between the month of March and April 2015 imported into Nigeria and kept in Ubulisiuzor in Ihiala Local Government Area of Anambra State within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, a Radio Transmitter known as Tram 50L concealed in a container of used household items which you declared as used household items, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 47(2)(a) of Criminal Code Act, Cap, C45 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004,\u201d another count read.\n\nDifficult Demand\n\nIn October last year, the government had filed an amended seven-count against the detained IPOB leader, charges which bordered on treasonable felony and his alleged involvement in acts of terrorism at the same court.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako, who was to preside over the case, later fixed Tuesday (January 18), to hear some pending applications, including the one Kanu filed to be discharged and acquitted.\n\nBarely a day to the scheduled commencement of the accelerated hearing, the government, in the amended process it filed before the court, increased the counts in the previous charge it preferred against the detained IPOB leader.\n\nKanu initially faces a seven-count treasonable felony charge will now enter his fresh plea to a 15-count amended charge.\n\nHe was first arrested in 2015 on charges bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms, and improper importation of goods, among others.\n\nVIDEO: \u2018We Cannot Release Him,\u2019 Buhari Says Nnamdi Kanu Should Defend Himself In Court\n\nThe IPOB leader, who was initially detained and arraigned in court, fled the country in 2017 after he was granted bail for medical reasons. Although he was later sighted in Israel, he was intercepted in June 2021 and repatriated to Nigeria \u2013 about four years since he jumped bail.\n\nAmid the calls for his release by some prominent individuals and groups in the South East, President Muhammadu Buhari hosted a group of leaders from the region under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats.\n\nAt the meeting held in November last year, the President promised to consider the request for Kanu\u2019s release, although he said it was \u201can extremely difficult demand\u201d.\n\nThe group had pleaded for a political, rather than military solution to the crisis in the region and promised to call Kanu and order agitators in the South East to order.\n\nBarely two months after the meeting, President Buhari, in an exclusive interview with Channels Television, stated that the IPOB leader should answer for his actions over the years, especially while he was out of the country.",

Debt Servicing now under APC takes over 98% of the Federal budget. The tales of woe is endless.\n\n\u201cIn particular, it is clear that the APC Government is a massive failure when compared with the records of PDP in government. The PDP handed over a $550 billion economy (the largest in Africa), but under APC, Nigeria is the Poverty Capital of the world.\u201d\n\nOn the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the governors asked the National Assembly to quickly conclude deliberations on the bill.\n\nSpecifically, they urged the federal lawmakers to either override President Buhari\u2019s veto or delete areas of complaints.\n\nThe governors explained that an early concluded Electoral Act is vital for credible elections.",

          "text": "Equatorial Guinea have caused the greatest upset so far at this year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), defeating continental champions Algeria 1-0.\n\nAlgeria\u2019s high-pressure style meant the Desert Foxes dominated play throughout much of Sunday\u2019s game, but their efforts were in vain as none of their shots found the back of the net.\n\nA compact and tactically rigid Equatorial Guinean side took advantage of Algeria\u2019s sterility, with Esteban Obiang scoring the only goal of the match at the 70th minute.\n\nThis was the second disappointment for the Algerian side in the tournament, held in Cameroon, having tied with Sierra Leone in their opening match last week.\n\nAlgeria had not lost a game since 2018 and was just two games short of matching Italy\u2019s world record of a 37-match unbeaten streak.\n\n\u201cEveryone was talking about our unbeaten run but now we need to focus on something else, go out and secure qualification,\u201d said Algeria manager Djamel Belmadi.\n\nThe holders now need a win in their final group game against Ivory Coast on Thursday to have a chance of reaching the round of 16.\n\nIn the other Group E game on Sunday, Sierra Leone capitalised on a terrible goalkeeper error deep in injury time for a 2-2 draw against two-time champion Ivory Coast.\n\nGoalkeeper Badra Ali Sangar\u00e9 landed awkwardly while trying to gather a header back from one of his defenders that was going out for a corner, with the ball slipping out of his grasp and allowing Alhaji Kamara to score Sierra Leone\u2019s equaliser in the 93rd minute.\n\nSierra Leone has now drawn against two heavyweights in Algeria and Ivory Coast to be unbeaten on its first AFCON appearance in 26 years.\n\nSoccer Football \u2013 Africa Cup of Nations \u2013 Group F \u2013 Gambia v Mali \u2013 Limbe Omnisport Stadium, Limbe, Cameroon \u2013 January 16, 2022 Gambia\u2019s Ebou Adams in action with Mali\u2019s Massadio Haidara REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El GhanyThe Gambia and Mali both scored penalties that were awarded after VAR checks [Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters]\n\nMeanwhile, tournament debutants The Gambia remained at the top of Group F after converting a 90th-minute penalty for a 1-1 draw with Mali.\n\nBoth sides scored penalties that were awarded after VAR checks. Ibrahima Kone scored for Mali in the 79th minute. But the Gambia, which had earlier hit the post and the crossbar with free kicks, saved a point through Mussa Barrow in the last minute.\n\nThe Gambia is unbeaten in its first two games at a major tournament, having won against Mauritania in its opener.\n\nIn the other Sunday game in that group, Tunisia recovered convincingly from its highly contentious loss to Mali to beat Mauritania 4-0.\n\nTunisia was 2-0 up after just eight minutes when captain Wahbi Khazri scored the first of his two goals in the match. Hamza Mathlouthi and Seifeddine Jaziri also found the back of the net in the expected win.\n\nOn Monday, hosts Cameroon, who have already secured passage to the next round, take on Cape Verde, while Burkina Faso play bottom-of the-group Ethiopia, in the final day of Group A fixtures. Both matches kick off at 16:00 GMT.",
