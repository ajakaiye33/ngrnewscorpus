          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nChidera Onwuzuruike was only 19 when her battle against schizophrenia began. Constantly plagued with indescribable fear of doom and death and hearing strange voices that kept telling her that she was going to die, Chidera said her struggle with mental disorder took her to places she would never have gone\n\nChidera, however, stressed that even though her life has been challenged by schizophrenia, she is determined to overcome the disorder and also help create awareness about the mental health condition.\n\nSchizophrenia starts mostly before age 25 \u2013 Psychiatrist\n\nAccording to a Consultant psychiatrist at the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Dr. Dapo Adegbaju schizophrenia develops in children as young as 10 years of age but mostly before age 25.\n\nExplaining what schizophrenia is, Adegbaju said, \u201cSchizophrenia is a chronic debilitating disorder that severely impairs day to day functioning of an individual. It is characterised by delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders and loss of motivation.\u201d\n\nAlso, according to the World Health Organisation, \u201cSchizophrenia is characterised by distortions in thinking, perception, emotions, language, sense of self and behaviour.\n\n\u201cCommon experiences include hallucinations (hearing voices or seeing things that are not there) and delusions (fixed, false beliefs).\u201d\n\nWHO said this mental disorder affects about 20 million people worldwide.\n\nThe global health agency also stated that Schizophrenia is treatable.\n\n\u201cTreatment with medicines and psychosocial support is effective,\u201d WHO said\n\nI was hearing voices, lost one academic year due to my mental disorder\n\nRecalling how her battle against the mental health condition started, Onwuzuruike, said her fight against Schizophrenia started slowly but progressed quickly making her lose one academic year in the university.\n\nSharing her experience with PUNCH HealthWise, she said, \u201cThat day I woke up in school and something just whispered to me \u2018you\u2019d die today.\u2019\n\n\u201cI struggled to get the thoughts out of my head but I couldn\u2019t. I still went about preparing for the event I had later that evening but the voice in my head kept saying, \u2018you\u2019ll be shot today, they will rob you and you will die.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the stage that evening, I forgot my lines. I could barely remember what I was supposed to say.\n\n\u201cAfter giving a horrible performance I told my friend that I think something is wrong with me but she assured me I was ok.\n\n\u201cLater, things became worse. I became restless. I was always on edge and I was suicidal. I had to tell my roommate to take away any sharp objects around me.\n\nI removed the bleaches, detergent and requested that my knife be taken away.\n\n\u201cThe thoughts were there but I wasn\u2019t able to execute them. I felt like I had restraint. That was the beginning of the degeneration of my health.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy period because the voices were consistent. Sometimes I heard voices telling me, \u2018You will run mad.\u2019 I started talking to myself. I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was disorganised.\n\n\u201cI was having nightmares and my speech was disorganised.\n\n\u201cI isolated myself. I wasn\u2019t going for lectures or any social gatherings because I was scared of being killed.\u201d\n\nOnwuzuruike, who is now a mental health activist said that during a very difficult period, she visited a private hospital, disclosing that after telling the doctor how she felt, she was only given a malaria medication and placed on sedatives.\n\nAccording to her, the drugs caused her to lose track of time and eventually started causing her seizures.\n\nAs the medications worsened her condition, her mother had to take her away from school.\n\nPastors said I was occultic, needed to pay to be delivered\n\nBeing an only child, Onwuzuruike\u2019s parents were agitated and desperate to find a solution to their child\u2019s mental health problem. She disclosed that her parents started seeking healing from religious places.\n\nAt the first church, they visited; Onwuzuruike said the pastor told her parent that she was having an attack from the devil and prayed for her and assured\n\nher that she would be successful at an event she was scheduled to attend in Umuahia.\n\nEmboldened by the pastor\u2019s prophecy, Onwuzuruike attended the event. Unfortunately, she recounts that the event was a total mess as she became psychotic.\n\nSpeaking, she said, \u201cAt the event, I became disillusioned and suffered a dramatic change of personality. Then I was put on a bus and sent back home but when I got home, I realised I didn\u2019t even have underwear on.\n\n\u201cThe transport fare I had; I gave it out to a stranger. I really can\u2019t remember how I got to the park but my father was there to pick me up.\u201d\n\nOnwuzuruike said then her parents took her to a private hospital where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\nRefusing to believe the diagnosis, her parents intensified their search for a miracle within the walls of churches.\n\nSearching for miracles doesn\u2019t come cheap. Onwuzuruike said her family spent a lot of money in churches for prayers, prayer assignments and purchasing deliverance instruments\n\n\u201cOne of the churches I went to told me to pay N50,000. They said I was occultic and to deliver me from that occult I had to pay then I would do some spiritual assignments.\n\n\u201cEven when my seizures started, they said I was the cause. They said they\u2019d use coconut water to wash my head for some days and I had to pay one thousand naira for every coconut that was broken in addition to the N50,000 I was asked to pay.\n\n\u201cAt another church, they said since I was nineteen, I was to pay N19,000 naira then I would buy eggs, salt, bowl, water, then meet the prophetess in front of the church where they would pour all of it on me.\u201d\n\nSchizophrenia is not a spiritual attack \u2013 expert\n\nDr. Adegbaju, however, stated that schizophrenia is not a spiritual attack, noting that it is a disorder that can be caused by genetics or by psychosocial stressors, or an interaction of both.\n\nHe added that \u201cAny psychosocial stressors can cause it, as well as substance abuse and neurodevelopmental disorders.\u201d\n\nDespite being scammed by different churches, Onwuzuruike never got any help nor got better but the hope still burned as they moved from church to church.\n\nIt was while in consultation with another pastor that the pastor had advised her parents to go to a hospital for diagnosis while still praying for healing.\n\nAfter two months of religious misadventure, Onwuzuruike was finally diagnosed accurately with schizophrenia in one of the eight government neuropsychiatric hospitals in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI was referred to a neuropsychiatric hospital from my school hospital. It was at the neuropsychiatric hospital that I was diagnosed with schizophrenia by two doctors.\n\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed, they didn\u2019t tell us what was wrong with me, they just placed me on drugs. They told us that I was unwell and that I just had to be placed on medications.\n\n\u201cAfter taking the drugs for a while I was the one who had to ask the doctor why I was taking drugs,\u201d she said.\n\nOnwuzuruike said she felt the doctors had wanted her to be more stable before they could inform her of her diagnosis.\n\nContinuing she said, \u201cThe doctor asked me why I was asking, I said I needed to know why I was taking the drugs, then he told me I had schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cHe was shocked when I told him I knew about schizophrenia. I told him I took psychology classes in school.\n\n\u201cHe was uncomfortable when I asked him if I would be on the drugs for the rest of my life but he eventually told me yes.\u201d\n\nOnwuzuruike said after she was placed on the medications, her parents were cautious as she experienced episodes of being unwell for a while before the drugs started acting.\n\n\u201cI used to have some episodes in the early days when I started taking my medications. At one point the gate was locked so that I wouldn\u2019t leave the house.\n\n\u201cBut as I continued with the medications, the behaviours stopped.\n\n\u201cIt took me about 10 months before I got myself together. Even for people who want to get medical help, it would look like nothing is happening at first but after a while, you begin to recuperate.\n\n\u201cAnd the recuperation is very fast but for the first few months you might not see the desired changes you want even as you keep taking your drugs.\u201d\n\nIn spite of the traumatizing health challenge Onwuzuruike faced, the lively young woman says she was never alone as her true friends never deserted her.\n\nAfter two years on the medication and now in her final year, she said she hasn\u2019t relapsed and \u201cMy lecturers have been helpful and encouraging. There\u2019s no problem educationally.\u201d\n\nOnwuzuruike also added that she had undergone three months of psychotherapy after diagnosis.\n\nTelling people about mental health\n\nAsked if she is concerned about letting people know she lives with schizophrenia, the activist said, \u201cI talk about it because it gives me an edge so that people would know what to do when around me\u201d.\n\nShe added that it created a bond between her and her roommates.\n\nShe said, \u201cI would say if you have a mental health struggle like this, don\u2019t be scared of sharing it with people. It\u2019s a form of therapy.\n\n\u201cFor people that are concerned, just be discreet about who you are telling unless you are like me that has grown confident and bold.\u201d\n\nOn her fears and concerns about living with schizophrenia, Onwuzuruike, who is also a radio drama writer said, \u201cHaving schizophrenia is not a tag, it is who you are so you should embrace it.\n\n\u201cThere will be challenges and I have concerns for the future, about me having a stable marriage, relationships, families but that doesn\u2019t deter me at all. I still believe that I have a beautiful future ahead of me.\u2019\n\nPeople with schizophrenia can live a normal life\n\nAdegbaju also said that people with the mental disorder can live a normal life as long as they \u201cadhere to their medications, avoid stressful conditions and report any signs promptly for attention.\u201d\n\nHe added that the condition is managed with aid of medications, psychotherapy, or both.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Late detection of endometriosis may reduce success of fertility treatment \u2013Study",
          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA new Australian study has found that delayed and undiagnosed endometriosis may affect the success rate of fertility treatment among women trying to conceive.\n\nResearchers from the University of Queensland in the study found that women diagnosed with endometriosis late were four times more likely to do a lot of fertility treatment cycles, sometimes up to 36 cycles before success.\n\nAccording to the researchers in the study published in ScienceDaily, diagnosing endometriosis before starting fertility treatment has a lot of benefits.\n\nIn Australia, the researchers said one in nine women were diagnosed with endometriosis, noting that 40 per cent of these women experienced infertility.\n\nThe scientists used data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women\u2019s Health to conduct the research.\n\nUQ School of Public Health researcher, Dr. Katrina Moss, said women whose endometriosis went undiagnosed until after they began fertility treatment ended up doing more cycles, used treatments that aren\u2019t recommended, and were less likely to have a baby.\n\nMoss said, \u201cBy contrast, our study found women who were diagnosed with endometriosis before fertility treatment experienced the same outcomes as those without the condition\n\n\u201cAustralian women can wait between four and 11 years before being diagnosed with endometriosis, and delayed diagnosis reduced the chances of fertility treatments being successful.\n\n\u201cIn our national study of 1,322 women, 35 per cent of participants had endometriosis and one-third of those weren\u2019t diagnosed until after they started their fertility treatment.\n\n\u201cWomen who were diagnosed late were 4 times more likely to do a lot of cycles, sometimes up to 36 cycles of fertility treatment\n\n\u201cThey were also 33 per cent less likely to report a birth.\u201d\n\nFertility specialist and UQ Centre for Clinical Research Professor, Hayden Homer said early diagnosis of endometriosis and early access to IVF created a level playing field, as the same outcomes were recorded for women who did not have the condition.\n\n\u201cIt is highly advantageous to diagnose endometriosis before starting fertility treatment and to adjust the treatment accordingly.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, women are less likely to have a child and face a higher financial and psychological treatment burden.\n\n\u201cIt is critical to remain highly vigilant about the possibility of endometriosis amongst women who are thinking about fertility treatment, especially in the presence of severe pelvic pain,\u201d Prof. Homer said.\n\nIn a 2016 study by researchers at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, it was found that egg quality is severely compromised in endometriosis.\n\nAlso published in ScienceDaily, the study found that the ability of the egg to mature was blocked by endometriosis, and furthermore that eggs could suffer serious damage by exposure to follicular fluid from women with endometriosis.\n\nDr. Simon Lane, Research Fellow at the University of Southampton who led the study said: \u201cWe believe these results could have clinical implications for many women struggling to fall pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe found that fluid from the follicles of patients with endometriosis was found to block egg maturation by generating free-radical chemicals called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the egg, which damaged their DNA.

          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA new Australian study has found that delayed and undiagnosed endometriosis may affect the success rate of fertility treatment among women trying to conceive.\n\nResearchers from the University of Queensland in the study found that women diagnosed with endometriosis late were four times more likely to do a lot of fertility treatment cycles, sometimes up to 36 cycles before success.\n\nAccording to the researchers in the study published in ScienceDaily, diagnosing endometriosis before starting fertility treatment has a lot of benefits.\n\nIn Australia, the researchers said one in nine women were diagnosed with endometriosis, noting that 40 per cent of these women experienced infertility.\n\nThe scientists used data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women\u2019s Health to conduct the research.\n\nUQ School of Public Health researcher, Dr. Katrina Moss, said women whose endometriosis went undiagnosed until after they began fertility treatment ended up doing more cycles, used treatments that aren\u2019t recommended, and were less likely to have a baby.\n\nMoss said, \u201cBy contrast, our study found women who were diagnosed with endometriosis before fertility treatment experienced the same outcomes as those without the condition\n\n\u201cAustralian women can wait between four and 11 years before being diagnosed with endometriosis, and delayed diagnosis reduced the chances of fertility treatments being successful.\n\n\u201cIn our national study of 1,322 women, 35 per cent of participants had endometriosis and one-third of those weren\u2019t diagnosed until after they started their fertility treatment.\n\n\u201cWomen who were diagnosed late were 4 times more likely to do a lot of cycles, sometimes up to 36 cycles of fertility treatment\n\n\u201cThey were also 33 per cent less likely to report a birth.\u201d\n\nFertility specialist and UQ Centre for Clinical Research Professor, Hayden Homer said early diagnosis of endometriosis and early access to IVF created a level playing field, as the same outcomes were recorded for women who did not have the condition.\n\n\u201cIt is highly advantageous to diagnose endometriosis before starting fertility treatment and to adjust the treatment accordingly.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, women are less likely to have a child and face a higher financial and psychological treatment burden.\n\n\u201cIt is critical to remain highly vigilant about the possibility of endometriosis amongst women who are thinking about fertility treatment, especially in the presence of severe pelvic pain,\u201d Prof. Homer said.\n\nIn a 2016 study by researchers at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, it was found that egg quality is severely compromised in endometriosis.\n\nAlso published in ScienceDaily, the study found that the ability of the egg to mature was blocked by endometriosis, and furthermore that eggs could suffer serious damage by exposure to follicular fluid from women with endometriosis.\n\nDr. Simon Lane, Research Fellow at the University of Southampton who led the study said: \u201cWe believe these results could have clinical implications for many women struggling to fall pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe found that fluid from the follicles of patients with endometriosis was found to block egg maturation by generating free-radical chemicals called Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the egg, which damaged their DNA. This damage caused the egg not to mature, and hence it could not be fertilised.\n\n\u201cMore research is now needed to investigate whether the damage caused by endometriosis is treatable or preventable.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026 It\u2019ll save Nigeria N268bn spent annually on pest control \u2013 Researchers\n\nBy Bashir Bello\n\nThe Federal Government has granted environmental approval for evaluation and open cultivation of a new maize variety, Tela Maize developed by researchers at the Institute for Agricultural Research, IAR, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria that resists fall armyworm, stem borers and tolerate moderate drought.\n\nThe Director-General, National Biosafety Management Agency, NBMA, Dr Rufus Ebegba, stated this while presenting the TELA Maize approval certificate to Executive Director, IAR, Prof. Ishiyaku Mohammed.\n\nDr Ebegba said the approval was granted following consideration of advice by the National Biosafety Committee, the National Biosafety Technical Sub-Committee and the risk management report provided by the applicant.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe Agency was convinced that there are no known adverse impacts to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, taking into account risk to human health. The permit, pursuant to this decision, is without prejudice to other extant legal requirements.\n\n\u201cThis permit authorises the permit holder and persons covered by the permit to commercialise the TELA Maize genetically modified for drought tolerance and insect resistance,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, during the public presentation of the new variety, the NBMA Director-General however warned that the agency will not hesitate to withdraw the permit and prosecute should there be any reason to do so.\n\nIn his remarks, the Executive Director, Institute for Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Professor Ishayaku Mohammed said the new Tella maize variety, resistant of pest, would save the country about N268 billion spent annually on importation of insecticides to spray the farm produce against a pest that destroys and responsible for the low productivity or yield.\n\nIshayaku maintained that the new variety also has the capacity to bridge the gap that exist in the nation\u2019s maize demand deficit which stands at 4 million tonnes.\n\nHe said the variety has the potential to shoot up the productivity to 3 tons and 30 bags per hectare as against what is obtainable of 1 ton and 16 bags per hectare respectively.\n\nThe University Don said, \u201cIt is really inspiring for IAR to secure NBMA approval for the commercial release of the drought-tolerant and insect-resistant Maize (TELA MAIZE).\n\n\u201cThis goes to further highlight IAR\u2019s capacity and commitment to providing effective solutions to agricultural problems facing our farmers and optimising food security for Nigerians. The approval will open the way to combating the devastating effects of both drought and insect pests through the deployment of this new variety of Maize into our farming system.\n\n\u201cThe next step is to further evaluate the performance of this new variety by farmers on their fields in all the major maize growing belts in Nigeria. Thereafter we shall seek another approval by the National variety release committee before making the seeds commercially available for farmers to plant in the 2023 cropping season,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, the Executive Director, AATF, Dr. Canisius Kanangire, said the approval has shown that Nigeria is really the giant leading the way in Africa and ensuring that smallholder farmers benefit from life-changing technologies that have transformed farming in other parts of the globe.\n\n\u201cThe approval by the government of Nigeria is a sign that we are making good progress especially in our quest to expand the options for smallholder farmers on the continent to profit from their labour by using affordable technologies that enhance productivity and reduce incidents of insect pests\u2019 infestation.\n\n\u201cTELA Maize is coming at a time when farmers are spending so much to reduce insect and pest attacks as well as battling with the issue of drought. With TELA Maize, farmers in Nigeria will have relief from frequent constant chemical sprays which affect their health. The saving from chemical use can be converted to address other family needs,\u201d Dr. Kanangire added.\n\nMeanwhile, the TELA Maize Project in Nigeria is part of an international Consortium coordinated by AATF, involving Bayer, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), and the National Agricultural Research Systems of seven countries including Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda since 2018. The Project builds on gains from a decade of excellent breeding work to develop conventional climate-smart drought tolerant maize known as Drought TEGO varieties.",

          "text": "Dr Bukola Saraki\n\nFormer Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki has sent a passionate appeal to members of the National Assembly who are in the process of reconciling the different versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill passed by both chambers to save the country the crisis and trouble that will result from the proposal to make direct primaries compulsory for parties in sourcing candidates for elections.\n\nSaraki in a statement signed on his behalf by Yusuph Olaniyonu, head of his Media Office, noted that the decision to include a provision in the proposed Electoral Act which makes it compulsory for parties to adopt direct primaries will only create a fresh problem while trying to solve another.\n\nREAD ALSO:N6.3tr Budget Deficit: Onuesoke backs NASS\n\nHe added that many of the political parties, lack the necessary infrastructure to successfully conduct direct primaries at all levels while the attempt will lead to hundreds of litigations that may jeopardize the general election.\n\n\u201cI feel compelled to once again appeal to Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the House of Representatives on the proposed Electoral Act because I realise that while the focus of the general public has been on how to get the electronic transmission of results into the proposed law, another potential problem that may clog our electoral process is included in the Electoral Act is this provision on direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe two options on the table are to make direct primaries compulsory for all the parties or to leave it open for parties to decide. We should take the latter option. Let us leave each party to decide how it wants to source its candidates. The experience we have in the past shows that direct primary will lead to a crisis if forced on the parties. We saw how people sent from the national headquarters to conduct primary elections stayed in hotel rooms and conjured up figures which were announced as the result of direct primary elections.\n\n\u201cEven if the big parties have the funds and facilities to organise direct primaries nationwide, how about the smaller parties? Can the big parties also provide the facilities and election officials that will be present in all the polling units in the country, either simultaneously or in staggered primaries? Do most of the parties have valid and verified membership registers and other logistics needed for the successful conduct of direct primaries? The direct primaries option will also put pressure on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) whose officials must monitor all the primaries.\n\n\u201cThe direct primaries provision may work for us in the future but not now that we are not prepared for it as the primaries may hold next June. That is just nine months from now. The time for adequate and necessary preparations towards direct primaries is even not there. There will be so many litigations arising from the process. Do we have the time to hold crisis-free primaries and not create booby-traps for the general elections?\n\n\u201cFrom my experience, this issue of direct primaries was raised in the Eighth National Assembly when we passed the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill. It has always reared its head as a fall-out of the internal dynamics in certain parties where legislators feel they have been short-changed in the congresses where state governors seized the structure because they felt the process was neither transparent nor free and fair. The legislators may now see the process of passing the Electoral Act as a means to settle the scores. However, in the process that we have now, it is the country that will lose. It is our electoral process that will be undermined.\n\n\u201cMy appeal goes to all members of the National Assembly. Please, do not let us take a position on critical issues based on partisan and personal consideration. Let us put Nigeria first and act in the best interest of our country. During our time in the National Assembly whenever we were confronted with issues like this, we just appealed and prevailed on members to put the nation first before any other consideration. I believe the same appeal should go to the present federal lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we also call on the leadership of the various parties to intervene and call all their stakeholders together to address the issues. The bulk of the responsibility to make the legislators do the right thing falls on the ruling party, the APC. It has the numbers to pass whatever bill the leadership desire in the National Assembly. The party should get its members to avoid including provisions in the proposed Electoral Act which may later become a major clog in the smooth conduct of our elections and the credibility of the electoral process\u201d, Saraki stated.",

I have decided personally that I want to do everything possible to promote positivity around me. So when you start showing that positive side, people learn from you; there are a lot of things that when you do right, before you know it, it becomes organic around you and then people look up to you and then they know there is hope.\n\n\u201cIn most times, we see it as a hopeless situation and people do what they like, even the advanced countries have their own moments and so they take a decision to say enough is enough. The citizens and youths should also be prepared to know that it starts from us, the orientation and everything should begin with us, so as we grow, those who are behind us have something to look at and emulate. We should change the narrative before us and not do things just like those in front of us.\u201d\n\nObi Cubana stressed, \u201cI am a living testimony, there is hope for the young, even if you don\u2019t know what you want to do, as long as you are willing to be directed, a good listener, fast learner, there is hope. Nigeria has over 200 million young populations which are growing. As someone in the entertainment industry, I see a lot of endless opportunities; in hotels, restaurants, music, arts, culture and all of these lies in the hands of young people. We rule in every aspect of these, so there is hope.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the success of the Cubana brand, he noted that from inception, their belief has been hinged on integrity, hard work and focus. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for a business I will do for a few years, pick the money and go, we are trying to create brands that will outlive us that our children will take over from them, so once they die, the business dies and their children are not even interested. Right now, we are building the Cubana brand to involve every member of the team, not just our children; Cubana can run without me that is why I can be here.\u201d\n\nWhen Pastor Adegboyega quizzed about the expansion of his brand, he informed that by the end of next year, the Cubana group would have set up at least in two locations in the United Kingdom, while adding that in the next decade, it will be a takeover for the brand.",

          "text": "Mr Osita Okechukwu, a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) has once again reminded the leadership of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) of the imperatives of striking a merger with APC, in the Zikist Model strategy, to win the Nov. 6, governorship poll.\n\nOkechukwu, who is also the Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON) told journalists in Abuja that APGA leaders should know that it is far better to be late than to be the late, insisting that APGA was on the way to losing its first governorship contest in Anambra after 16 years.\n\nREAD ALSO:Obiano seeks NCAA approval to open Anambra Airport\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I wish to appeal once more to APGA leaders to explore a Zikist Model merger with APC for a guaranteed seamless victory in the Nov. 6 polls.\n\n\u201d In saying this, I know for sure that APC can win without APGA, but would enjoy seamless victory with a Zikist Model merger,\u201d he stated.\n\nOkechukwu had recently urged APGA leader to key into an all important merger, so as to kill two birds with one staone by joining the mainstream and paving way for the emergence of Nigeria President of Igbo extraction.\n\nOn speculations that APC was plotting a forceful takeover of Anambra through the institution of state of emergency, Okechukwu explained that a merger of the two parties would not only cool the political temperature, but will also moderate the environment and end up as a political masterstroke.\n\nHe recalled the history of political understanding between President Muhammadu Buhari and the late Ikemba Nnewi, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, stressing that it was in that spirit that Buhari assured Gov. Willie Obiano recently last week, that there was no cause for alarm as declaration of state of emergency was not on the cards.\n\n\u201cWhereas, I have my sympathy for the families of victims of banditry in Anambra and by extension Nigeria in general; however it is my considered opinion that we should repeat the cordial relationship between with Ikemba, Odumegwu Ojukwu and Buhari, when he led APGA to a political understanding with the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) led by Buhari. We can repeat this Zikist feat again, for it is better to be late than the late.\u201d\n\nHe further recalled a similar political camaraderie in 2013, when a faction of APGA joined the merger of APC, adding that Buhari more or less saved Obiano from opponents of his re-election bid in 2017.\n\n\u201cSo, as I said two months ago, the suggestion flows from the prism of pragmatic Zikist political model, which joins us with APGA. Pragmatism is the best strategy for Ndigbo to kill two birds with one stone, because if APGA fuses into APC, that will give APC three states in the South East geopolitical zone \u2013 a milestone.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu insisted that APGA was missing the point by seeking to remain as a big fish in a small pond of regional politics that has only earned it just one state in the entire federation.\n\n\u201cA merger will not only more than any other factor guarantee Ndigbo the presidential ticket of the APC; but it will safe APGA from likelihood of withering away, without tangible dividends of democracy for its followership.

We are better off as one nation, that is why we are strong and that is why we can face the world.\u201d\n\nStill emphasizing the point about unity, Osinbajo noted that \u201ceverywhere in the world today, people are coming together to form stronger units, they are not breaking up, this is not the time to break up.\n\n\u201cIf you read the economics of smaller nations, they are looking for ways of how they can become stronger by aligning with other nations. How does a country with all the potentials and everything that we have, think that the best way is to break up?\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the VP explained that \u201cwe are at a point in time in our history where we have security challenges, we have economic challenges, and if you talk about security, there are so many dimensions to it.\n\n\u201cIf you look carefully, all of these could happen to any government and I think we are in the very best position to solve the problems that face us today.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecurity challenges that we have didn\u2019t show up in one day, but it is the government, the people, the men and women that will handle them.\n\n\u201cWe happen to be that government, and I am very convinced that we are entirely capable of handling it. I think we are in the best possible position to solve these problems,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nIn addition, the Vice President spoke about the popularity and credibility of President Muhammadu Buhari, identifying it as a crucial factor in galvanizing the entire system in resolving the challenges.\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cthe President is possibly the most popular Nigerian politician that we have ever had in generations. He is possibly the only person who can go into a place or somewhere without bossing people to gather and they will come and listen to him speak.\n\n\u201cWe need that level of credibility to be able to solve problems in our country. And I think because of his level of credibility, despite everything, he is still the only one that can call everyone, and even people who do not necessarily agree with him know that he is a man of his words.\u201d\n\nWe will overcome insecurity \u2013 Buhari assures Nigerians",

          "title": "2022 Budget: FG sets aside N327bn to pay MDAs electricity bills",
          "text": "From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja\n\nFederal Government has set aside a total of N327 billion in the 2022 Budget to offset the electricity tariff shortfall incurred by the Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) who are not paying electricity bills.\n\nWhile N27 billion goes to the MDAs, N300 billion would be used to settle other tariff indebtedness which the distribution companies (DisCos) incurred because of their inefficiency.\n\nSpeaking at a 2022 Budget Breakdown, organised by the Ministry of Finance Budget and National Planning, at the weekend, in Abuja, the Director General of Budget Office, Mr Ben Akabueze, said that the government is a shareholder in the DisCos but the government has not started collecting dividends from them.\n\n\u201cThe government is a shareholder in the companies. But as a shareholder, you don\u2019t collect part of the revenues the company collects. We share in the profit of the company when the company makes a profit and declares a dividend. So, the billings of DisCos are not part of government revenues.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, because the electricity tariff that we all pay does not cover the cost of producing the power, there is a shortfall the government has to incur on behalf of the citizens. In 2022, the tariff shortfall is projected at N300 billion and we provided for it. This is the money that we have to pay.\n\nWe provided another N27 billion for the MDAs electricity use. And that is government trying to lead by example. Many MDAs are defaulting in paying electricity bills\u201d Akabueze, declared.\n\nHowever, going forward, the government has put a mechanism in place to make it difficult for MDAs to incur electricity bills and not pay for it.\n\n\u201cWhile we are trying to resolve the historical situation, going forward we are going to tighten up and provide a mechanism where MDAs can\u2019t incur utility or electricity debts and leave them behind. So, instead of us receiving from the DisCos from this budget, there is a provision in this budget to pay money to the DisCos.\n\n\u2018The DisCos are at the collecting end. When they (consumers) pay them, they have to pay the generation companies (GenCos) who generate power. Then, the GenCos will have to pay the gas companies that supply them the gas which they use to generate power. What has happened now, however, is that the system has been tightened. There is what is called the waterfall payment mechanism designed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). So, every electricity bill can only be paid into a bank account and that is any money that goes there is a waterfall arrangement that determines how that money is shared by every part of the chain. How much of it goes to the GenCos, how much goes to the gas suppliers. This is something under the purview of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is empowered to protect the consumers and I am aware that they take action.\n\nOn the distribution of meters, the DG acknowledged that it is increasing adding that the Power Sector Recovery Plan (PSRP) has been mandated to deploy over 6 million meters before the end of 2025.\n\n\u201cI think, all across the country you will notice that the metering is improving. The problem of metering is not just about distribution but the skilled manpower to install and deploy these meters. There is a government and Central Bank of Nigeria-supported programme to procure and deploy about 6 million meters and that is being tracked.\n\n\u201cThis committee that is under the Vice President and the Finance Minister which called the Power Sector Recovery Plan (PSRP) has the goal to get that sector back to viability by 2025\u201d he said.\n\nIn her remarks, the Miniser of Finance Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, acknowledged that the privatisation of the power sector has been problematic but the DisCos have brazed up to the challenge and they have made a lot of efforts to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cThe DisCos have not started paying taxes or royalty dividends. This is not what was expected in the privatisation. The privatisation itself has been problematic. But of recent there is a lot of efforts that have been put together by the distribution companies to improve the performance of the sector\u201d she submitted.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has proposed to spend N2,490,658,599 on state house clinic, salary, sewage, electricity charges and internet access in 2022.\n\nA breakdown of the aforementioned budget shows that the chunk of it, N1,346,707,871 goes to salary payment. State house clinic is expected to gulp N687,425,876, while N35,418,735 is for sewage charges. N354,000,000 will be spent on electricity charges and N67,106,117 on internet access.\n\nAlso in the budget is N8,580,741 that will be spent on books, N40,684,950 on water rates, N26,432,346 on newspapers, N3,511,909 on magazine and periodicals and N87,067,986 on other maintenance.\n\nN1,600,000,000 will be spent on phased replacement of vehicles and spares.\n\nMeanwhile, experts have hailed the N16.39 trillion 2022 budget\u2019s timeliness and benchmarks, describing them as realistic.\n\nThe oil benchmark for the 2022 appropriation is $57 per barrel, while the exchange rate is N410.5 per dollar in the budget proposal titled, \u201cBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\u201d.\n\nThe budget is projected to stimulate GDP growth by 4.2 per cent, while inflation rate is put at 13 per cent.\n\nIt is projected oil production will be at 1.88m barrels per day including condensates, while the budget deficit is estimated at N6.23 trillion.\n\nCommenting on the appropriation bill, Nigeria\u2019s first professor of the capital market and former Imo State Finance Commissioner, Prof Uche Uwaleke expressed hopes that the National Assembly will conclude work on it before the end of the year to enable implementation to commence in January following the President\u2019s assent.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the mending of the hitherto broken budget year is a major achievement by this administration. I think the budget benchmarks are largely realistic with respect to crude oil price of $57, exchange rate of circa N410 and real GDP growth rate of 4.2%\u201d, he said.\n\nProf Uwaleke, however, picked holes with the inflation rate of 13%, saying it does not appear realistic considering the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) requiring the complete removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the President admitted, the concern about increasing deficit financing through borrowing is justified. The consolation however is that all new borrowings are tied to critical projects. It\u2019s equally noteworthy that the government has made provision for use of Green bonds as well as PPP arrangements in financing infrastructure\u201d, he told Daily Sun.\n\nWhile presenting the budget on Thursday, President Buhari prioritised defence and internal security, adding that his administration remained resolute to securing lives, property and investment nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated. \u201cThe 2022 budget is also the first in our history, where MDAs were clearly advised on gender responsive budgeting.

          "title": "Anti-Open grazing law: Herders defiant, dare Southern govs",
          "text": "From: Tony John (Port Harcourt), Stanley Uzoaru (Owerri), Chijioke Agwu (Abakaliki), Obinna Odogwu (Awka), Lateef Dada (Osogbo), Laide Raheem (Abeokuta), Paul Osuyi (Asaba), Geoffrey Anyanwu (Enugu), Okey Sampson (Umuahia), Obinna Odogwu (Awka), Oluseye Ojo (Ibadan)\n\nRespite which communities in Southern Nigeria thought would soon come to them following the decision of the Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing is fast turning into a misplaced or dashed hope.\n\nLike an occupying army of invaders, armed Fulani herdsmen have continued on their menace of grazing herds of cattle in farmlands in the region. In the process, the animals utterly destroy the crops as they voraciously eat the leafy greens.\n\nSo, when in May 2021, Southern governors met in Asaba, the Delta State capital, and passed a resolution announcing a total ban on open grazing of cattle in their states, they also set September 1, 2021 as deadline for each state to pass laws to authenticate the ban. With the exception of just a few, several Southern states have enacted laws against open grazing.\n\nHowever, in terms of implementation of the anti-open grazing laws, reports from various states showed that the new laws appear to be mere window dressing aimed at appealing to the electorate, given that the states lack capacity to enforce them. The laws placed on the police and other security agencies the burden of enforcing the ban. In essence, the ban on open grazing has been akin to the case of the toothless bulldog that can bark, but not bite, as the power of enforcement still lies with the Federal Government due to its exclusive control over the Police and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nRIVERS\n\nIn Rivers State, Livingstone Wechie, a community leader and public analyst, opined that the law cannot be truly enforced as the Commissioner of Police is not legally bound to carry out the directives of the state governor without clearing from the Inspector General of Police in Abuja.\n\nWechie said that compliance with the law has been very low as there have been several confrontations between the farmers and herders in Eleme and Ahoada areas of the state.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected the southern governors to work and build security systems with community-based structures to protect our farmers from these marauding attacks. We still hear cases of the farmers being killed by these terrorist-herders the Federal Government claims are foreigners,\u201d Wechie said.\n\nReports gathered from several communities alleged that some of the herders are being escorted by the military, thereby instilling fear in the community dwellers. Some rural dwellers confided in Sunday Sun that the so-called herders have the full protection of \u201cpowers from above.\u201d\n\nThey frowned at the energetic efforts of the Federal Government in opposing the ban on open grazing without seeing anything wrong in the horrendous damage being done to crop farmers by the herders.\n\n\u201cThe cattle are more protected because the cow\u2019s life matter more than human lives. This stance of the Federal Government has continued to embolden the herders knowing that the government has assured them full protection. This may force the communities to resort to an avoidable option.\n\nIMO\n\nEncouraged by the position of Governor Hope Uzodimma, Fulani herders still openly graze their cattle in the streets, roads in the state as well as uncultivated farmlands.\n\nAlthough reported cases of herders-farmers clash have subsided, most residents in the state still express fears that the present calm may be transient as the armed marauding herders may revert to their old ways without real provocation.\n\nOne of the residents who simply gave his name as Mr Collins said: \u201cWe have not experienced trouble from these people for some time, they move about on the roads and in my area, Oforala in Owerri-West Council Area, we have not had any trouble with them. But we don\u2019t know how long this will last; maybe tomorrow they will go back to their old ways. The state government should join other Southern governors in condemning open grazing in Imo.\u201d\n\nOn the presence of vigilante in the state, a farmer acknowledged that there is no strong vigilante service in the state. \u201cThey were scared away by the state government which promised to float local vigilante in the rural areas. We are still waiting for that to happen,\u201d the farmer said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ebubeagu security outfit announced by the Southeast governors with fanfare is yet to commence operation in the state.\n\nEBONYI\n\nThree years before the Southern Governors Forum resolved to ban open grazing of cattle, Ebonyi State had since 2018 enacted the Ebonyi Miscellaneous Offences Law against it.\n\nSunday Sun learnt from the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Cletus Ofoke, that the enactment of the law followed a meeting between the government and the leadership of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), to deliberate on ways of ending attacks by herders on farmers.\n\nOfoke, chairman of the Ebonyi State Committee on Herders and Farmers Relationship, noted that the 2018 law addressed all the salient issues relating to farmers and herders activities in terms of open grazing and underage grazing.\n\nDespite the existence of the 2018 law, herders have continued to clash with farmers in some parts of the state. Then in April 2021, herders killed over 30 persons in Egedegede community in Ishielu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe incident, it was gathered, followed a clash between the Fulani herders and farmers in Ishielu communities. The incident generated a lot of concern across the country, prompting the herders in the state to leave on their own accord for fear of repraisal attacked.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, Governor David Umahi said that security reports confirmed that the herders had left Ishielu. Since that unfortunate incident there has been no clash between herders and farmers anywhere in the state since May this year.\n\nANAMBRA\n\nIn a seeming act of defiance, herdsmen still move around various parts of the state, including Awka, the state capital, to graze their cattle at night when the roads are virtually empty. Most residents only see the cow dung litter the paved roads in the morning.\n\nChairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Southeast, Gidado Siddiki, told Sunday Sun that the arrangement put together by the Anambra State Cattle Menace Committee was still operational and would likely remain so until a bill, entitled: \u201cOpen Grazing of Cattle and Other Livestock Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Bill,\u201d which has been before the House of Assembly, is passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor. It is aimed at banning open grazing in the state.\n\nUnder the arrangement, herdsmen pay compensation to farmers whenever their cattle stray into the farms and destroy crops. It\u2019s the same way when a farmer kills a cow.\n\nHe, however, told Sunday Sun that his people became confused when the bill surfaced in the state House of Assembly.\n\nHe said that they are confused on the next step to take or what would happen when the bill becomes a law.\n\n\u201cEverybody is confused. First of all, a bill has been proposed and our people have no alternative. They have been doing this their business for years. So, they have no alternative because the bill will soon become a law.\n\n\u201cFor now, we have no challenge, but what we are scared of is, you know that some people are ignorant of what the bill is. So, when they hear that the House of Assembly has passed a bill, some people may use that opportunity to attack our people.\n\n\u201cNothing has happened yet. I am not saying that they\u2019re attacking our people, no! Nobody has attacked our people, but we don\u2019t know what the consequences of that bill will be when it becomes a law\u201d, Siddiki said.\n\nOSUN\n\nHerdsmen in Osun State are not fully obeying the anti-open grazing law signed by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, Sunday Sun has gathered.\n\nThey still move around with their cows and no punishment has been meted out to any violators of the law. However, there appears to be a good relationship between the government and the herders, and there is relative peace.\n\nThe chairman, Committee on Fulani/Bororo and Crop Farmers, Hon. Mudashiru Togun, who spoke with Sunday Sun, said that there has been no confrontation between farmers and herders in the state.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any problem in Osun with or without anti-open grazing law. There is no issue at all. Osun has been peaceful and will continue to be peaceful. As far as herders/farmers are concerned, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d Togun stated.\n\nA farmer at Antakiti farm, along Ikirun road, Osogbo, Mr Isiaka Isamotu, confirmed to Sunday Sun that the herders still move around with their cattle.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have had issues and we fought seriously. But now, they are very careful to avoid entering farms. Though they still move around, I doubt if they are aware of the said law.\u201d\n\nThe Seriki Fulani in Osogbo, Ibrahim Babatunde, said that his members are moving about with their cattle because there has been no issue with the people, even before the law.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem between my members and the farmers. We have warned our people not to go to the major roads and they should not enter peoples\u2019 farms. If not because of strangers that are causing the problem, we don\u2019t have issues with farmers because we know that we are going to pay damages if our cattle eat crops in farms.\u201d\n\nThe Special Adviser to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola on Civic Engagement, Hon. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, who held a stakeholder meeting with Serikis and all herders to sensitize them on the law, said that the level of compliance has been commendable.\n\nHe attributed the success of the peace to the continuous engagement and sensitization, adding that a mechanism has been put in place to receive complaints from farmers.\n\n\u201cThere is continuous engagement with all social strata, non-indigenes, particularly the Fulani. We are seriously having a good relationship with them. We swing into action immediately we receive any report about any issue between farmers and herders. This has helped us a lot,\u201d Oyintiloye told Sunday Sun in a chat.\n\nThe Chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAM), Osun State chapter, Alhaji Sulaiman Araokanmi, said that the herders have complied to some extent, saying that farmers have not been complaining the way they used to lament before the law was signed.\n\nHe said that the farmers are also planning to select 10 representatives while the herders will also present 10 in each local government to discuss and agree on terms to complement the effort of the government at sustaining peace.\n\nOGUN\n\nThere has been observable reduction in open grazing in Ogun State, even though enforcement of the law against it, recently signed by Governor Dapo Abiodun, is yet to commence. The new law made provision for a six-month transition period. Open grazing is becoming minimal. Before the signing of the law, herders were often sighted grazing their cattle in residential areas and farms, particularly those close to the rivers. The law allows people or corporate bodies to obtain permits from the state to set up ranches.\n\nA resident of the state, Abayomi Arabambi, a public affairs analyst, told Sunday Sun that people are waiting for the expiration of the six months grace period to see how effective enforcement of the law would be.\n\nDELTA\n\nThere appears to be a lull in the clashes between crop farmers and herdsmen across communities in Delta State. Yet, herders still move about with cattle in residential areas particularly within semi-urban areas in the state, even though Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has signed the \u2018Delta State Livestock Breeding, Rearing and Marketing Regulation Law 2021.\n\nThe enactment of the law has created confusion among Hausa/Fulani community in the state as they claimed that they have not been adequately educated on the subject matter.\n\nThere appears to be apprehension among the Hausa/Fulani that they might be attacked by overzealous members of local vigilante in attempt to enforce the law.\n\nChairman of the Cattle Dealers Association in the state, Musa Shuwa, said that they have been kept in the dark as far as the new law is concerned, noting that the development was creating panic among those in the marketing of cattle.\n\n\u201cThere is a big problem, now many people want to return, our traders and others, it is a very serious matter. The situation is very dangerous, we are afraid of these local vigilantes, maybe our people would be attacked.\n\n\u201cThe business is under serious threat. Before now, cows will come from Cameroon to Adamawa and then we bring them to the South for sale. But now from Adamawa, cows are being returned to Cameroon.\n\n\u201cThe people are afraid because if we bring cows to the Southeast, we might be attacked and our cows rustled. We are traders, the market they give us is too small, so we told our people to stop bringing cattle. But I have told my people to hold on and observe the situation because we don\u2019t have any other place to go from Delta. I have been doing my business in Asaba for over 40 years, most of us have investments here and our children attend schools here.\n\n\u201cHowever, as we speak now, government has not shown us any designated area for our business; they just left us in the dark. I appeal to government to critically look into these issues and invite us for discussion,\u201d Shuwa said.\n\nAlso, Mr Maikudi Ningi said that the people have not be properly educated on the new law and what is expected of those in the livestock business, noting however that as residents, they were prepared to obey the laws of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, the state government said that the enforcement of the law might not commence immediately.\n\nThrowing light on this, Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, said that it would take another period of time before implementation could start properly.\n\n\u201cNo state can even start implementation immediately because after passing the bill and assenting to it, you need to give people time to adjust. You need to give the herders time to either return their cattle or build ranches,\u201d Aniagwu explained.\n\nCorroborating Aniagwu\u2019s views, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Okowa, Olisa Ifeajika, said that a lot of sensitisation would be carried out to properly educate the people before full enforcement would start.\n\nENUGU\n\nFollowing the passage of the \u201cBill to Prohibit Open Grazing, Regulate Cattle Ranching and for Connected Purposes,\u201d into law on Thursday, September 2, by the Enugu State House of Assembly, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi assented to it on Tuesday, September 14.\n\nSince the law came into force, the state has not recorded any incident between herders and farmers.\n\nAccording to some natives in the rural areas where the menace of the herders used to be pronounced, though the Fulani herdsmen have not stopped open grazing, they seem to be more careful and cautious now.\n\nA farmer from Ukpabi Nimbo in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area, Chief James Enechi said that since the attack at Adani by unknown gunmen where some soldiers were killed and a Police Station burnt, they have not been seeing the herdsmen again around their area.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor some time now the herdsmen are no more seen around our place here and that was since that problem at Adani. Fulani herdsmen are no longer here. Since that incident, we don\u2019t hear of them again.\u201d\n\nAnother farmer from Opanda who pleaded anonymity said that \u201cpeace has returned to our area for some time now maybe it might be because of the new law. We don\u2019t see the herdsmen often like before; these days they graze slightly along Opanda and then move into Kogi.\u201d\n\nSome other people said that the herders were still grazing openly around the bushes and forests of the state without any question.\n\nBut speaking about the mood among the herders since the bill was signed into law, the Chairman Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Southeast Zone, Alhaji Gidado Siddiki said that it has not been easy for them.\n\nHe, however, confirmed that they were still grazing openly, but with serious caution to their members to avoid destruction of food crops.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe life is not easy, everybody is in fear, but nothing has started happening, our people are just grazing as they were doing before. We have told them that they have to be careful about destruction of food crops. We said that if they did not destroy anything, all these things will not even arise.\n\n\u201cThe law has been passed, we are law-abiding citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we have to abide, but we are scared, let some people not use the opportunity because there is a law and start attacking my people. But as at now nothing is happening.\n\n\u201cAlready there is an existing Committee in the Government House Unit which the governor appointed which is always mediating between the herdsmen and the farmers and up till now they are resolving matters.\n\n\u201cSo what we are saying is that we are not against the law, but what we are saying is that we need to get another alternative. If you say stop what you are doing then you need to get something that we will be doing. If they can get us how we can drop our cow, we will train our people, but it will take a long time at least five or six years to train our boys for them to acquire lands where they can build this modern system. Things have changed and we most change, but it has to be gradual, it cannot be done abruptly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, nobody has been arrested over the anti-open grazing law and nothing has been seen in the area of any move to make ranches.\n\nABIA\n\nDespite Governor Okezie Ikpeazu signing the bill on anti-open grazing, passed by the state House of Assembly, into law, Fulani herdsmen are still moving about with their cattle in every nook and cranny of the state as if there was no law against the practice.\n\nThe most worrisome aspect is what is happening in the heart of the commercial city of Aba. In the Waterside axis of the city, the herders intermittently march their animals along the stretch of Ikot Ekpene road, a major entry point to the city.\n\nMovement of cattle on this popular road from where they get to their various grazing points, apart from creating an eyesore with the dung splattered along the road, they equally constitute enormous nuisance to the commuting public, with the attendant hazards as most accidents that occur on that portion of the road, 80 per cent are attributed to the movement of these animals on the road.\n\nApart from enacting the law and tinkering with the idea of relocating the abattoir at Waterside and re-establishing the cow market there at Ukwa West, which it has lacked the political will to actualize, the state government has actually not done much to enforce the law, and no violator has been arrested for contravening the law.\n\nThe state government has, however, extricated itself from blame in this regard.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi-Kalu, it was the duty of security agencies in the state to enforce laws of the land, including the anti-open grazing law. But this is not being done. The result is that the people are still at the mercy of the herders in the state.\n\nA farmer from Umuobasi Ukwu, Ozuitem, in Bende Local Government Area of the state, Mr. Maduka said they were still suffering in the hands of the herders as their cows continue to destroy their crops. He said they chose to keep quiet for peace to reign because the last time the villagers had issues with the herders, police supported the herders.\n\n\u201cThat we kept quiet this while doesn\u2019t mean all has been well with us. The last time we had issues with them, the police was on their side, so we have decided to apply wisdom this time around.\u201d\n\nAnother farmer, Peter Egbuta from Umuhu Ezechi, one of the communities serving as pasturing fields for the herders, their crops are being continually destroyed by cattle. He appealed to the government to do something to save them from the herders.\n\nAs the anti-open grazing law is not being enforced, coupled with the \u201csuffering and smiling\u201d attitude of the natives, having been so presented with conducive atmosphere in Abia, the herders have nowhere to relocate to but are instead occupying deeper portions of the forests of Abia North and grazing their cows along which ever route they choose, unhindered.\n\nWith the free hands given to herdsmen to operate in the state, they go to any length with their cattle in search of fresh grasses.\n\nCROSS RIVERS\n\nHerders in Cross River State are still moving around with their cows grazing openly in defiance of the resolution of the Southern Governors Forum.\n\nThey have been emboldened in this regard by the fact that Governor Ben Ayade has not yet signed the Anti-Open Grazing Bill passed by the House of Assembly in 2017 into law.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. William Jonah Eteng, had disclosed that the state was one of the earliest to pass law against open grazing.\n\nHe said the House still stands by the law and urged the governor to sign it into law considering the security situation in the country.\n\nThe absence of the law has caused some confrontations between herders and farmers in some communities in the state.\n\nInvestigations by Sunday Sun revealed that there is a feud between cattle herders and youths of Nde community in Ikom and in Biase communities.\n\nThe youths of Ikom and some community leaders are said to have risen against the massive destruction of farmlands in their place and, therefore, gave the herders ultimatum to evacuate their cattle.\n\nThere has been tension since the ultimatum expired on September 30, 2021, with the youths insisting that the herders must leave their land.\n\nVillage source said the security operatives give cover to the herders and even manhandle the youths in the community for daring to confront the herders.\n\nThe lawmaker representing Ikom II State Constituency in the State Assembly, Hon. Elvert Ayambem, admitted that there is growing tension in the community due the clashes between the herders and the youths and if not handled urgently it may escalate.\n\nIn Biase community, the story is the same as herders and farmers have also clashed and the community have also asked the herders to leave the community.\n\nA community leader in Obubra, Chief Samuel Agbor, said that it is surprising that the herders are just moving freely in the state as if nobody matters.\n\nOYO\n\nThe convener, Igangan Development Advocates (IDA) in Ibarapa North Local Government Area of the state, Diran Oladokun, told Sunday Sun, that for the past few months, there has not been open grazing of cattle in Aiyete, Tapa and Igangan.\n\nHowever, there has not been implementation of the anti-Open Grazing Law in the state, adding that the pressure from the powers that be from the federal level is applying.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nHe stated that the state government needs the support of all and sundry to implement the anti-Open Grazing Law, which according to the Special Adviser to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Security Matters, Mr Fatai Owoseni, a former Commissioner of Police in Lagos and Benue states, was already in existence before all the governors in the Southern part of Nigeria, agreed to ban open grazing in their states.",

Not even the pleas of the lawyer who just wedded in April this year with his wife said to be carrying about seven months pregnancy could save them, as the heartless criminals pumped hot bullets into their victims.\n\nThe gunmen were said to have burnt the Lexus sports utility vehicle they came with and left the area with the lawyer\u2019s vehicle.\n\nThere have been killings in Onicha Igboeze in the last three months by gunmen and security agents.\n\nLast month, a 27-year-old woman and daughter of the traditional ruler of the community, Elizabeth Agwu, was hit by a bullet when policemen invaded the community to arrest a suspect. She died as a result of the bullet which got her on the abdomen.\n\nBefore this period, yet-to-be identified gunmen had on Monday, August 9, 2021, the first day of the sit-at-home order called by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to press for the release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, killed at least eight persons at Anike Onicha in Onicha Igboeze.\n\nThe killings took place at about 6:00a.m on that black Monday: the victims were going about their normal businesses when they were accosted, attacked, killed and their vehicles, motorcycles and other valuable property burnt.\n\nTwo of the victims were natives of Anike Onicha, while one hailed from Ezza North Area of the state, but resident in Onicha where he traded in household items. The rest were people from different parts of the country passing through Onicha. The incident had caused serious panic and fear within the community and its environs especially as the identity of the perpetrators were not ascertained.\n\nHowever, police in the state accused the pro-Biafra group, IPOB, of masterminding the killing while enforcing its sit-at-home order in the area.\n\nA family member of Eze Nwangwu, who was among the people killed in the attack told our correspondent on phone that investigation conducted by the community indicated that the attack was properly planned.\n\nThe family source who pleaded anonymity said: \u201cThat day at about 6:00a.m our brother was attacked and killed alongside seven other persons. The incident happened within 30 minutes. The criminals camped inside the bush along the road. One of the survivors who narrated the story told us that they had blocked the road and were taking people into the bush where they killed them. They wore masks and dressed in black overall. At the end, two youths were killed in Anike.\u201d\n\nAsked if the victims had been buried, he said no, adding that the delay was occasioned by the inability of the police to release their bodies.\n\n\u201cThey have not been buried because the police refused to release the bodies to us. But I can confirm to you now that all that have been resolved and they will be buried on 26 and 27 of October,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the bereaved families mourn their beloved ones whose lives were cut short be some bloodthirsty goons, the Police in Ebonyi State said they were on the trail of the assailants.\n\nConsultant to Ebonyi State Government on Internal Security who is also in charge of the South East Security Network, Ebubeagu, in the state, Chief Stanley Okroemegha, told Sunday Sun that the outfit has been working in harmony with other security agencies to arrest the situation.\n\nHe said that \u201cthe efforts of the police and Ebubeagu have paid off as some of the perpetrators of that killing have been arrested. Our men are always patrolling all parts of the state to ensure that people are not harassed or attacked by unknown persons. And I can assure you that we will continue to do our best to ensure the security of lives and property in the state.\u201d\n\nThe foregoing scenario clearly showed that the security situation in the Southeast has almost deteriorated. Policemen and other security agents are randomly attacked and killed at checkpoints and in their stations. Civilians are equally attacked and killed by rampaging gunmen.\n\nIn fact, no state can be said to be free from the growing bloodbath in the region and security agencies are apparently not on top of the situation. As gunmen continue to spread sorrow in the Southeast, the people of the region are living in fear and uncertainty.\n\nAnambra: A new killing field\n\nSince this year, more than 20 people including policemen, naval officers, a staff of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) and civilians have been killed by gunmen in parts of Anambra State.\n\nAlso, property worth several millions including police stations, patrol vehicles, and others have been destroyed by the attackers even as guns and other security gadgets belonging to the security operatives were taken away.\n\nThe first attack by gunmen in Anambra this year was on February 24, when four policemen said to be on duty in Mkpologwu and Omogho communities in Aguata and Orumba North Local Government Areas respectively were dastardly killed and their patrol vehicles set ablaze. The attackers also reportedly made away with their victims\u2019 guns.\n\nBut while the matter was still raging, gunmen struck again on March 18, killing three policemen on duty at a location in Neni community, Anaocha LGA of the state and carted away their rifles. They also set their patrol vehicles ablaze.\n\nOn the same day, three naval personnel on duty at Awkuzu, Oyi LGA were attacked and killed. Their guns and other military equipment were equally taken away by their killers.\n\nOn March 19, gunmen attacked a vehicle belonging to the Nigeria Correctional Service on court duty, killing one staffer and a policewoman who joined the vehicle from the court in Ekwulobia.\n\nThese killings and burning of police stations continued until about three months ago when there was what looked like a break. Within the short period of the break, the residents of Anambra with the exception of Awka which witnessed a few more cult related killings, had some reprieve.\n\nHowever, there was a resurgence last month, in what could be termed the return of gunmen in Anambra. This time around, security operatives were not just targeted, eminent persons and politicians were not spared.\n\nDr. Chike Akunyili, the husband of the erstwhile Director-General of the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), the late Prof. Dora Akunyili and his colleague, Dr. Lawrence Ezenwa, were among high profile murders in two separate attacks by gunmen lately. Also, the convoy of House of Representatives member, Chris Azubuogu, was attacked and his driver killed, within the same period. A police station was attacked in Ajali, also in the state, among others.\n\nOne of the latest victims whose death deeply pained Anambra people and Nigerians generally was Dr Akunyili.\n\nThe medical doctor was said to be returning from an event in Onitsha axis where he had received a posthumous award on behalf of his late wife before the gunmen killed him around Nkpor.\n\nBefore the killing of Akunyili and Ezenwa, the traditional ruler of Mkpunando community in Aguleri, Anambra East LGA, Igwe Alex Edozieuno, was assassinated alongside his driver whose name was simply given as Chukwuemeka.\n\nThey were killed on September 10, 2021 after Ezu River Bridge along Onitsha-Otuocha-Adani Road while returning from a visit.\n\nEven, his son, Prince Chinedu Edozieuno, has, since, raised the alarm over threat to his own life. Chinedu told newsmen that those who killed his father were trailing him. He said that he had received a number of threat messages from the suspect who had asked him to stop searching for who killed his father.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state has since tagged the former monarch\u2019s death a politically motivated one.\n\nDirector General of Andy Uba Campaign Council, Paul Chukwuma, and the state chairman of the party, Chief Basil Ejidike, at a press conference in Awka, said that the deposed monarch was killed not long after he publicly joined the APC.\n\nThe attacks by gunmen in the state last Sunday also consumed the Nnewi residential home of Chief Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the APC and aide to the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nOn the same day, the attackers equally set the Nnewi office of the Directorate of State Service (DSS) ablaze. Igbokwe said no life was lost, but that his property was burnt down.\n\nAlthough some groups have been suspected to be behind the evil act, the perpetrators of these dastardly acts have not been established. The state police command said that it was working round the clock to unearth the suspects.\n\nReacting to the ugly developments, former National President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo (Youth Wing), Tony-Uche Ezekwelu, condemned the killings, saying that it was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cI must tell you that the rate and direction of the attack is going, you\u2019ll see that it is purely politically motivated. A lot people are trying to heap it on the IPOB/ESN, but if you look at the directions of the killings, some of the persons that were killed have no business with the IPOB\u201d, he said.\n\nGovernorship candidates of the various political parties in Anambra State have also condemned in strong terms, the killings and destruction of property by gunmen in the state.\n\nCandidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Valentine Ozigbo, Andy Uba (APC), Obiora Okonkwo of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, described the attacks and killings as barbaric and unacceptable.\n\nLike the former Ohanaeze youth leader, Senator Uba believed that the killings were politically motivated.\n\nThe Anambra situation may end up raising a can of worms as accusations and counter accusations fly about. While the APC in the state blame the APGA-led government for the killings; Governor Willie Obiano dropped the bombshell last Wednesday, when he accused some of his colleagues of sponsoring violence in his state.\n\nPolitical Adviser to the governor, Chief Ifeatu Obi-Okoye, who made the allegation gave that as the reason Obiano had again shunned the security meeting of Southeast governors and some leaders from the zone in Enugu on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the Ebubeagu security outfit which should ordinarily have assisted the security operatives in combating insecurity has not been floated in the state.\n\nBut, vigilante groups have been in operation for a long time in the state. Part of their job is to secure the communities and also assist the police and other security operatives.\n\nMeanwhile, as part of efforts to address the insecurity in the state, Obiano recently announced a N20 million bounty on the killers of Dr Akunyili.\n\nThe state police command has also said that serious efforts were being made to apprehend the gunmen terrorizing the state.\n\nPolice spokesperson in the state, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, told our reporter that police were working real hard to track down the attackers.\n\nEnugu: Residents feel the pangs too\n\nEnugu State has had its share of the killings by \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen with recent ones being the dastard murder of the Managing Director of Scientific Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), Prof Simon Ndubuisi and his Police escort in Enugu along Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway; retired Justice Stanley Nnaji along Garden Avenue Enugu, soldiers at Adani, policemen at checkpoints at Amodu Nkanu and Nachi in Oji River to mention but a few. Owner of Auto Ease Services, a popular car painting company, Ifeanyi Okeke, was also recently shot dead in Enugu.\n\nUnfortunately, things have become so confused in the Southeast zone that it is difficult to actually narrow the killings to a particular group, though fingers are being pointed at the Eastern Security Network (ESN), security agents and Fulani terrorists.\n\nWorse still, the Ebubeagu security outfit hurriedly announced by the Southeast governors to fight the Fulani killer herdsmen terrorizing the region has not taken off in Enugu. The state\u2019s preferred outfit, Forest Guards, seems not to have been designated to address security issues in the towns and urban centres of Enugu State.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has also shown interest in the Neighbourhood Watch, which he uses to guard against invasion of the rural farming communities.\n\nImo, Abia not yet free from gunmen\n\nImo State has been in the firm grip of violence allegedly perpetrated by unidentified gunmen since after the EndSARS protests in 2020.\n\nBut the situation worsened with the simultaneous attacks on both the police and the prisons headquarters in Owerri on the Easter Monday.\n\nEver since, the killings have continued unabated especially in Okporo, Umutanze, Omuma, Amaifeke, Eziachi, Orsu communities in the Orlu Senatorial District of the state.\n\nOn the evening of Thursday, September 16, 2021, Darlington Odume, a prominent lawyer in Orlu town was gunned down in a supermarket in Umudara Amaifeke community where he had gone to shop for his family by the ubiquitous gunmen who shot him at pointblank. Odume died on his way to the Imo State Teaching Hospital.\n\nAccording Duruoma Ike, one of the witnesses, the assailants of Odume who were in an SUV and dressed in black like the police special forces had apparently trailed him from his office in Orlu without his knowledge to the supermarket which was incidentally in his community.\n\nThey had waited outside for him to come and that immediately he came out, he was shot on his chest four times and they drove off from the scene at high speed before the people who were already perplexed could react.\n\nHe added: \u201cI am very sure that those who shot Odume are certainly from this state, but what I can\u2019t say for sure is if they are members of the IPOB/ESN. The ESN could not have been responsible because he was handling cases of some of those arrested by the police on the allegation that they were members of the IPOB in Orlu. Initially, when those armed men came down from their SUV, most people who were around the vicinity including myself had thought that they were police officers because they were all attired in black with black jeans because that is how the police dress these days. But it was not until they opened fire on him which sent those around scampering for safety that I knew that they were assassins.\u201d\n\nDuruoma Odimara, a security consultant, said that though he had not personally encountered the so-called \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen, that some of the video of their activities posted on the social media showed that the people are certainly from the Southeast or other states like Rivers or Delta, but are Igbo.\n\nHowever, he noted that the situation has degenerated because of the incompetence of the security agents especially the police whom he accused of mental laziness.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that the police as a result of their mental laziness and beer parlour policing are not able to tackle the situation. In this state before the advent of the ESN, we have been under siege of armed robbers and kidnappers in the entire Orlu zone, and I am sure it is these criminals who are now masquerading as \u2018unknown gunmen.\u2019 All those who have been arrested by the police or the army; I have not seen any Hausa man or Fulani man because they are easily recognizable. I am also sure that the IPOB/ESN are no longer operating in this state, so the police if their intelligence is still functioning should be able to know those who are responsible for what is happening,\u201d he opined.\n\nIn addressing the issue, the state government at the height of the gunmen attacks on police infrastructure had provided them with more operational vehicles, communication equipment and even more amoured tanks.\n\nHowever, in spite of Governor Hope Uzodimma signing into law the establishment of the Ebubeagu, with about 3,000 personnel reportedly trained at the Police College Oji River, Sunday Sun gathered that the security outfit was yet to be established in Imo.\n\nIn Abia State, apart from killings recorded when gunmen attacked some police stations, the killing of a businessman early this year at the Isuikwuato axis of the state and that of a student of Marist Comprehensive Academy, Uturu, Master Donald Edeh around Ihube Road, there had been no other reported killings in the state in recent times.\n\nThe late businessman was killed while travelling with his family, while the deceased student, Edeh, was shot dead as he was returning with his colleagues after visiting a Final Religious Profession of some Marist Brothers in Orlu, Imo State.\n\nPeople residing within Isuikwuato and Uturu, Abia State and Okigwe, Imo State axis, which have become black spots of violent crime of late told Sunday Sun, that they suspected Fulani herdsmen for the atrocities perpetrated in their areas.\n\nThey blamed the herders for the killing of the businessman and Edeh.\n\nHowever, in the case of the Isuikwuato incident, the natives said a local vigilante group working in consonance with security agents, were able to identify and neutralize the gang members.\n\nSunday Sun learnt that a butcher who hails from a neighbouring community, but doing business in Isuikwuato, served as informant to Fulani herdsmen in the area.\n\nIt was also gathered that the butcher who stayed in a strategic location in Isuikwuato, was the one passing information about the movement of people to the herders who stationed in a bush outside the community.\n\nWith the information provided by the butcher, his Fulani herdsmen accomplices, were able to track down their victims who they abduct for ransom or kill outrightly like in the case of the businessman.\n\nAfter the killing of the businessman, the vigilante in the area swung into action and with the backing of security agents, the gang members were apprehended and since then, there has been relative peace in the area.\n\nBut the area has remained a nightmare as the Uturu-Okigwe axis where the activities of the hoodlums has remained unabated.\n\nWith the killing of the student, Abia governor, Okezie Ikpeazu directed the state Commissioner of Police, Mrs. Janet Agbede to work in concert with her Imo State counterpart to fish out the perpetrators of the heinous crime.\n\nHowever, more than one month after the incident and the corresponding directive, it was yet to be known if any headway has been made in that direction.\n\nA native of Uturu who gave his name as Egbe Ude alleged that the \u201cgovernment and security operatives cannot claim they do not know from where these abductions and killings going on in the area are coming from, but I don\u2019t know why they have not acted swiftly to arrest the situation\u201d.\n\nHe said that it will be practically impossible for the local vigilante to apprehend the perpetrators of the heinous crime in the area because of the sophistication of the arms they carry about and their modus operandi.\n\nSearch for solution\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof. George Obiozor, recently described the violence in the area as a systematic destruction of the geo-political zone.\n\nThe socio-cultural group also drew the attention of the IPOB to the danger violence has posed in Igbo land and asked the group to facilitate an end to the carnage.\n\n\u201cToday, what we are seeing in Igbo land is not liberation, but Igbo destruction and devastation. It is a national tragedy for Igbo. The liberty and freedom of Ndigbo are threatened internally and externally. I call on IPOB leaders to reassert its authority and control of the organisation,\u201d Obiozor stated.\n\nFirst Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulke Amechi, has also appealed to those behind the alleged insecurity in the region and Anambra State in particular, to sheath their sword and allow peace to reign.\n\nIn his statement at his house in Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government Area, Anambra State, Chief Amechi, appealed to whoever might be responsible for the killings and destruction of property to please drop their weapons \u201cbecause peace is never won with the guns.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman lashed out at the Southeast governors, for what he called their inability to hold their mandates well, saying \u201cthey are not acting as true Igbo leaders, they are leaders, but they don\u2019t seem to know that, look at the Ebubeagu they formed, they cannot even finance it, they are not serious.\u201d\n\nHe urged the governors to buckle down and save their people from further annihilation by gunmen.\n\nAlthough the leadership of IPOB has maintained their innocence in the orgy of killings and violence in the zone, Chairman of South East Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, last Wednesday, alleged that criminals have hijacked the activities of IPOB.\n\nUmahi who spoke on a live television programme alleged that some persons living abroad had taken control of the Biafra agitation and continued to play on the emotions of the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou see, at the beginning where we have IPOB saying they are agitating for the creation of Biafra for the reason of the marginalization of the zone. And then a lot of people keyed in, and it became that anybody that has a problem with the centre, the person becomes a supporter of IPOB, those in Diaspora that went for greener pastures that failed to get such become very bitter with the Nigeria government and so, the followers kept growing, and then the issue of herdsmen came up and there were a couple of killings in Southeast and the people were killed helplessly and they felt the governors were not protecting them.\n\n\u201cBut we did quite a lot to ensure that there is peace between our farmers and the herdsmen, but that was not the way some people that were aggrieved wanted us to go, but that was the way we should go. Then came up the IPOB/ESN, which is the militant aspect of the IPOB, and then they started to issue orders of threats like if you do this, if you do that and all sort of that. Along the line the whole exercise was hijacked, we no longer have kidnappers and armed robbers, every criminal now claims to be an IPOB member, and some politicians from what we learnt also capitalized on that and started importing killers from outside Southeast to advance their political interest by what we are seeing in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nUmahi said that his colleagues working with other Southeast leaders were bent on finding lasting solution to the grievances of the people of the zone especially the youth.\n\nHe lamented that restiveness had endured in the region because a lot of people had been brainwashed and misinformed into believing that some persons were fighting for them.\n\nA communique by the governors and leaders of the zone after their meeting in Enugu condemned the killings in the region and resolved to join forces with the country\u2019s security agencies to end the menace.\n\nThey also directed all the states to launch Ebubeagu by December 31, and give it the necessary legal backing. The meeting further condemned the frequent sit-at-home calls by non-state actors, particularly the IPOB, and vowed to do everything within the law to end such orders.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nWell-endowed songstress, Chinenye Joy Nweke a.k.a Supernova, doesn\u2019t mince words. She speaks candidly and directly, especially when it comes to comparing herself with others.\n\nIn this interview, the versatile singer, actress and movie producer opens up on her career, insisting that she\u2019s better and more beautiful than all other Nigerian female artistes. Enjoy it.\n\nTell us briefly about yourself?\n\nMy name is Chinenye Joy Nweke popularly known as Supernova. I am 22 and first child from a family of eight. I\u2019m from Ebonyi State, but graduated from Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK) where I studied Business Administration. I won some beauty pageants at the time, including Queen of Anambra Heritage despite being a native of Ebonyi State.\n\nYou\u2019re fast becoming a household name and your Abuja show turning a talk of the town, this must have cost you a fortune; how are you coping with it?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve spent over N150 million since the establishment of Black Celebrity Empire, my music outfit. Aside this, I\u2019ve made some financial impact on over 10,000 youths across the 36 states of Nigeria. And they have contributed to my career as well. Music is not easy, it costs too much money, but God has been there for me, and I\u2019m happy the way my career is going.\n\nWhat influenced your stage name, Supernova?\n\nThe stage name, Supernova was influenced by my love for science. Supernova means \u2018when the star explodes it\u2019s the brightest to that of the sun\u2019, so I chose the name to illuminate the entertainment scene. Yes, I am Supernova. My journey into the music world started in 2019, and I have a few singles to my credit, including Badder Than You, Bounce, Key, Moon, Holyshit, and Hustle Go Pay, and my latest effort, Casanova.\n\nWhat inspired your song, Casanova?\n\nThe song, Casanova is from my experience back in 2018. I had this guy I was dating; he was a Casanova. One woman was not always okay for him. He was everywhere and always playing with my emotions. This song and my other songs tell a story as it concerns poverty, maltreatment, discrimination, domestic violence, gender humiliation, and corruption at all levels.\n\nWhich audience does your music look to capture?\n\nI want my music to be loved by all. Growing up, I always listened to Bob Marley because my dad always played his songs, though he\u2019s late now. So, I love his music because it tells stories, he feels the pain of the people, he knows what the masses are passing through. I got inspiration from there. This is what you can associate my music with, the reality and what people go through.\n\nAre you looking to work with other artistes?\n\nI really look forward to working with artistes in Nigeria and internationally. I look forward to working with the likes of 2Baba, Big Wiz and Davido.\n\nAs an artiste, what stands you out?\n\nConsidering my style of music, I would say I\u2019m bringing the future of music to Nigeria. I have different genres of sound, including my main Afrobeat, R&B and hip-hop. You will also hear trap music instrumentals all embedded in the modern style of music that I would be bringing, which is something unique and different. And there\u2019s a message in every of my songs.\n\nAre you saying you have what it takes to compete with other female artistes in the industry?\n\nI have what it takes to shine in the industry. I have the passion for music; I\u2019m also here for the money because I love money as an Igbo girl. I\u2019m confident, I have the beauty, and looking at sexiness, I would be bringing the full package especially how a 21st Century female artiste should look. Presently, I don\u2019t think there is any (Nigerian) female artiste that is as beautiful as I am or has a good song like I do, because my songs are not just about the beat, but also about good lyrics.\n\nHow have you been tackling challenges?\n\nThere are always challenges. Starting anything like music or even any business, the challenges are always there, but one shouldn\u2019t give up. Music is like a product and as such can be challenging trying to get people to listen to you and love what you do. But I\u2019m grateful for the crew I\u2019m working with. I almost gave up. But I had to tell myself \u2018if I stop doing music what else will I do? I didn\u2019t want to go into movies fully where I\u2019m more of a producer than actor. Although, doing movies makes me happy, but I\u2019m more excited doing music where I fully express myself. Music is the only thing that wakes me up in the middle of the night, and if it\u2019s not going well, I will start crying and feel depressed.\n\nTell us more about your Abuja show?\n\nMy concert is coming up on October 16, 2021 at the prestigious Transcorp Hilton in Abuja. Tagged: \u2018Supernova Live\u2019, the show will feature 2Face, Juliet Ibrahim, Edo Pikin and another notable one I don\u2019t want to reveal for now.\n\nHow would you advise up and coming artistes?\n\nDon\u2019t give up, as it is usually not smooth from the onset. When you\u2019re newly entering into the music space, you have to remove your mind from making money immediately. Just have the passion and let the passion first drive you. There are millions of fans out there that would subscribe to your music; just be you. Even when others around you say that your music is trash, gather courage to put that music out and you will not regret it.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "PDP Chair: Northern Caucus Considers Consensus as Mark, Lamido Shoot Ahead",
          "text": "\u2022Aliyu, others seek to join race Atiku, Saraki\u2019s groups move to take control of party machinery\n\n\u2022Southern leaders zone other offices Sale of forms for offices commences tomorrow\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nAs the race for the position of the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gathers momentum, northern leaders are considering the adoption of a consensus option to select the chairman of the main opposition party, following the zoning of the office to the region, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nInvestigation has however revealed that a former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark and a former Governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Sule Lamido have remained the front-runners in the race for the PDD chairman.\n\nLamido is believed to be backed by the loyalists of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, while Mark is said to be supported by the loyalists of former Military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd); a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Aliyu Gusau, and some other northern elders\n\nAlso in the race are former Governors Babangida Aliyu of Niger State; Ahmed Makarfi of Kaduna State; Ibrahim Dankwabo of Gombe State; Ibrahim Idris of Kogi State, and Ibrahim Shema of Katsina State.\n\nThe party\u2019s outgoing deputy national chairman, Senator Suleiman Nazif has also indicated interest, while a former Senate President, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and Professor Jerry Gana are also believed to be in the race.\n\nHowever, the loyalists of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki have intensified their alleged quest to take charge of the party\u2019s machinery and truncate the bid for a southern presidential candidate.\n\nAtiku and Saraki\u2019s loyalists are said to be plotting to take control of the party so as to retain the presidency in the North in 2023.\n\nThe Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led zoning committee of the PDP had zoned the positions of the National Chairman; Deputy National Chairman (North); Deputy National Secretary; Deputy Publicity Secretary; Deputy Financial Secretary; National Organising and Mobilisation Secretary; National Legal Adviser; Youth Leader; Treasurer; and Deputy Auditor to the North.\n\nThe southern leaders in the party have zoned the position of the National Secretary to the South-west while the South-east and the South-south will produce the National Publicity Secretary and other positions.\n\nThe Chairman of the PDP National Convention Committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Hon. Ahmadu Fintiri has said that the sale of forms for the various offices will commence on Monday.\n\nFollowing the disagreement over the selection of the national chairman by the northern leaders, the Northern PDP caucus had on Thursday night set up a 20-man search and screening committee.\n\nEach of the 19 states in the North is expected to submit the names of three interested candidates for the chairmanship position to the 20-man committee, which will meet on Tuesday.\n\nAs the report of the 20-man committee is being awaited, the northern leaders are said to be considering the consensus option to select an acceptable candidate.\n\nSpeaking to journalists yesterday at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja, Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State also threw his weight behind selecting a consensus national chairman for the party.\n\nAt the meeting of the northern leaders of the party, the northern stakeholders squared up against the northern governors, insisting that there should be no imposition of any person as a national chairman.\n\nBut Mohammed argued that the election of the party chairman could cause a division within the party.\n\n\u201cConsensus is normally a process of democratic consultation because democracy is about consensus. Certainly, the electoral process can be reduced by having a converging point on an individual and that would have reduced the disparaging issues within the party.\n\n\u201cI did say we should have a consensus candidate, but where we will not, we will not practice imposition.\n\nWe have resolved the issue of zoning. The PDP is a mature party, we have always done; within the experience; we have garnered over the years and what we have been able to do for this country.\n\n\u201cWe have learnt our mistakes, we are not going to play to the gallery the way and manner our detractors or our competitors want us to be.\n\n\u201cWe will always resolve our issues; so, zoning is over. We have gone over this issue. What we are looking forward to is the emergence of Chairman from the North, who will give us the leadership that we require to form a government in 2023,\u201d Mohammed explained.\n\nHowever, the chairman of the convention committee, Fintiri said that it is too early in the day to discuss any consensus option for any office in the convention.\n\nHe added that the party will adopt the consensus option if the need arises, adding that the constitution of the party approves the emergence of party officials through consensus.\n\n\u201cIf the issue of consensus arises, it is captured in our constitution,\u201d he added.\n\nFintiri said that the sale of forms for the various offices will commence on Monday.\n\nHe further disclosed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had been duly informed of the October 31 national convention, while the venue of the convention is Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the accreditation of delegates would take place at Area 10 Old Parade Ground, also in Abuja.\n\nFintiri noted that between 4,000 and 6,000 delegates are expected during the convention.\n\nThe Adamawa State governor added that every office during the convention is open to all eligible members of the party.\n\nWhile pledging a free and fair convention, he also said that the electoral committee for the convention has been sensitised to organise an efficient and transparent national convention.\n\nThe Fintiri-led screening committee of the party will conclude its assignment on October 18.\n\nSouthern Leaders Zone Other Offices\n\nMeanwhile, the southern leaders in the party have micro zoned the offices zoned to the region.\n\nWhile the South-west will get the National Secretary and National Women Leader, the South-east will produce the National Publicity Secretary, National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Secretary.\n\nAccording to the zoning arrangement, the Deputy National Chairman and National Auditor will emerge from the South-south.\n\nThere are strong indications that the National Vice Chairman of the party, South-south, Chief Dan Orbih may clinch the position of the deputy national chairman.\n\nAlso, a former National Secretary of the PDP and former Governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola may return as the national secretary.\n\nAt the meeting of Thursday night, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State tried to sell the candidacy of a former Senate President, Ayu, to northern stakeholders as a consensus candidate but was stoutly resisted.\n\nOrtom was said to have raised the issue of having a Christian chairman to pacify the Christians.\n\nAs a result of his agitation, Prof. Jerry Gana, another Christian has indicated interest.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Army to court-martial 158 officers, soldiers in North-east\n\n\u2022Bandits kill 22 persons in attack on Sokoto market\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has again given an assurance that the federal government would do everything within the ambit of the law to eliminate all the criminals involved in the insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, and politically motivated killings across the country. The Nigerian Army also yesterday inaugurated a Special Court-Martial and a General Court Martial to try 158 officers and soldiers for various offences committed in the ongoing war against insurgency.\n\nThis is coming as no fewer than 22 persons have been killed by suspected bandits who attacked a market at Ungwan Lalle in Sabon Birni Local Government Area in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto State.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the passing out parade for Cadets of 68 Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna, the president announced that more equipment had been received from some friendly nations to improve security operations.\n\nAccording to him, his administration remains focused on its priority of improving security, bolstering the economy, and fighting corruption.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs you are all aware, our beloved nation Nigeria is facing many security challenges at this period. We continue to face security threats and violent crimes such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, and politically motivated killings which threaten our national integration.\n\n\u201cI assure you that this administration will continue to do everything within the ambit of the law to eliminate all forms of violent crimes that are creating fear and anxiety among the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state in this regard that we have received new equipment in our fight against any form of insecurity from our friendly countries.\n\nThese assets will be deployed to accelerate the fight against insecurity in all parts of the country,\u201d he explained.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that security had assumed priority in governance and public policy in the international scheme of affairs.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is against this backdrop that we introduced a new Landing Ship Tank early this year to replace the first set of naval ship tanks, which were decommissioned by the Nigerian Navy.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the Landing Ship Tank is expected to bolster the Navy\u2019s Sealift capability and promote our global maritime commerce, peace, and safety within the Gulf of Guinea and our maritime neighbourhood,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President said the government was poised to eliminate the incentives for corruption by addressing some of the remote causes as part of a long-term strategy for a more effective and sustained war on the practice.\n\nHe said improvement of livelihoods of citizens had been going on in partnership with the relevant organised private sector.\n\nAccording to him, some of the interventions by the government are: \u201cA smart law enforcement; provision of improved access to education that prepares our youths for global competitiveness; provision of quality health services for improved life expectancy and decent and affordable housing, among others.\n\n\u201cIt is the conviction of this administration that ineffective policies for social provisioning must be redressed in our efforts to tackle the fundamental causes of corruption in our society. This is how best to give vent to the much-cherished values of fairness, equity, and justice to the people of this nation.\n\n\u201cI must also emphasise here that, for us to achieve a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic country that will attract foreign investors we must be law-abiding, committed, and promoters of peaceful co-existence.\n\n\u201cThis is a collective responsibility which will yield the Nigeria of our dreams,\u2019\u2019 the president noted.\n\nBuhari commended the NDA Commandant, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Manu Yusuf, for the infrastructural upgrade in the military institution, and the colourful parade by the cadets of 68 regular courses.\n\n\u201cIt gladdens my heart to see the level of infrastructural development in the Academy. It is a clear testament to the vision, dedication, and excellence in the best tradition of NDA.\n\n\u201cNigerians acknowledge that the Academy has consistently justified its existence over the years by turning out well trained and disciplined officers for the Armed Forces of Nigeria as well as militaries of allied nations.\n\n\u201cThe NDA has over the years trained and graduated military and paramilitary personnel as well as interested civilians seeking postgraduate education.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore not surprising that the Academy has earned a reputation as an outstanding military Academy in Africa. Let me, therefore, extend my sincere felicitation to the Commandant, staff, and gentlemen cadets of the Academy on this memorable occasion,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe president, who was the Reviewing Officer, told Graduating Officer Cadets, that the world they were entering was very different from that which confronted many of their predecessors.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe contemporary security environment has been described as violent, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\n\n\u201cYou can therefore expect that the missions that you will be tasked to undertake will be similarly complex. Beyond these significant rationales, I am convinced that we have a real stake, and an abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where school children are not kidnapped and where individuals are not slaughtered because of their tribe, faith or political beliefs.\n\n\u201cI believe that a world of greater freedom and tolerance is not only a moral imperative but also a fundamental requirement for our collective safety. I am however delighted with the training you have undergone as you have been well-prepared to meet the challenges you will face in the field.\n\n\u201cYou have all been carefully nurtured by competent instructors and staff during your time in this Academy. In the course of your training, you have been subjected to gruelling regimes of exercises, simulations, and bespoke programmes that have prepared you for the tasks ahead. On your behalf, I offer heartfelt thanks to everyone here at NDA for the skills, competencies, and confidence they have embedded in all of you\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari appreciated families and friends of Cadets for standing by the impressive young men and women who were passing out, urging continued love for them in the course of their career and beyond.\n\nArmy to Court-martial 158 Officers, Soldiers in North-east\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Army yesterday inaugurated a Special Court-Martial and a General Court Martial to try 158 officers and soldiers for various offences committed in the ongoing war against insurgency.\n\nAbout 158 accused persons \u2013 28 officers and 130 soldiers will face the court-martial.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Theatre Commander of Operation Hadin Kai, Maj. Gen. Christopher Musa inaugurated the court-martial at Maimalari Cantonment Officers Mess Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\nPresident of the General Court Marshal is Maj. Gen. Bainze Mohammed, while the Judge Advocate is Lt. Col. Rotimi Bakari.\n\nThe Special Court-Martial is headed by Brig. Gen. Dominic Udofa while the Judge Advocate is Squadron Leader Audu Satomi.\n\nInaugurating the court-martial, Maj. Gen Musa said the court-martial, regimental and judicial exercises were put in place to enforce discipline in the military.\n\nAccording to him, the military panel may review, reduce or remove the rights and privileges of convicted service personnel.\n\nHe affirmed that it was unique to the military and a tributary of a criminal trial that flows into the sea of Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the conduct of military trials under the Armed Forces Act is to deal with matters that pertain directly to the regimentation, discipline, efficiency, and morale of military personnel.\n\n\u201cTo maintain the Armed Forces in a state of readiness, the military as an institution must be ready to enforce internal discipline effectively by the extant law\u201d, he said.\n\nThe theatre commander noted that it was imperative to state that the military compact with the state has placed officers and soldiers on a very high pedestal of responsibility than other citizens because the military remained an organisation that is guided by two sets of laws in the command.\n\nMusa added that the court-martial was not only viewed as a jury trial but also a court to speedily dispose cases and award punishment in the event of a conviction.\n\nTo this end, he said, emphasis shall be laid on the statute laws and the traditional military regimentation with due adherence to the fair hearing requirements as enshrined in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\n\nThe Theatre Commander of Operation Hadin Kai, therefore, urged officers and soldiers to discharge their duties diligently without fear, favour, or affection.\n\nHe also urged the courts to discharge their duties while strictly guided by the need to do justice to the accused, justice to the victims of the alleged infractions, and justice to the state whose laws were alleged to have been broken.\n\nHe disclosed that there were three panels to be inaugurated, noting that beyond the two inaugurated yesterday at the Maimalari Cantonment Officers Mess, one will be inaugurated on Monday in Sector 2 Damaturu, Yobe State.\n\nBandits Kill 22 Persons in Attack on Sokoto Market\n\nIn another development, no fewer than 22 persons have been killed by suspected bandits that attacked a market at Ungwan Lalle in Sabon Birni Local Government Area in the Eastern Senatorial District of Sokoto State.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that several other persons were also injured in the attack, which occurred on Friday.\n\nThose that sustained injuries are currently receiving treatment at the General Hospital in Sabon Birni while others with life-threatening injuries were referred to the state capital for proper medical care.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the Minister of Police Affairs, Mr. Idris Gobir, and a former Chairman of Sabon Birni LGA, Mr. Abdullahi Tsamaye confirmed the attack to journalists yesterday evening.\n\nTsamaye said the assailant came in large number into the market and started shooting sporadically aiming at anybody in sight.\n\nHe said in the process, the gunmen killed over 22 persons and burnt down vehicles, and destroyed several other properties.\n\nAlso confirming the attack the Special Assistant to the Minister for Police Affairs, Gobir, said about 22 people died in the attack.\n\nAccording to him, the victims include traders from Sokoto town who were in the village for business transactions.\n\nGobir further said about 35 people are currently in various hospitals receiving treatment for the injuries sustained during the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to get the reaction of the Sokoto State Police Command were not successful as the Command spokesman, ASP Abubakar Sanusi, could not be reached at the time of filling this report.\n\nIt has been recalled that Sabon Birni in the Eastern Senatorial district of the state is an epicentre of banditry.\n\nTroops Kill Five Gunmen, Lose Soldier in Enugu\n\nIn a related development, troops of Sector 5 of Exercise Golden Dawn deployed in Enugu State have killed three gunmen who attacked a Nigerian Police checkpoint along Okija-Onitsha Expressway on October 7, 2021.\n\nAn Army statement said troops engaged and overwhelmed the gunmen with superior firepower, forcing them to flee the scene. Troops however gave them a hot pursuit and engaged the gunmen in a gun duel.\n\nThe three gunmen, who drove in two vehicles \u2013 a Hilux and Hummer bus, eventually succumbed to the troops\u2019 effective firepower, while others fled with gunshot wounds.\n\nTroops also recovered one vehicle and two motorcycles, while conducting further exploitation of the general area for the fleeing terrorists.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, a soldier paid the supreme price, in the line of duty, for his country\u201d, it said.\n\nIt said the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya has commended the troops for the feat and urged them to sustain the momentum against all criminal elements operating in the region.\n\nThe COAS also sympathised with the family of the fallen hero and prays for the repose of his soul.\n\nDiscipline Bedrock of Nigerian Army, Says COAS\n\nMeanwhile, the COAS, Yahaya, has said that discipline remained the bedrock of the Nigerian Army in the discharge of its constitutional roles.\n\nThe COAS made the assertion yesterday when he visited the Nigerian Army School of Military Police (NASMP), the Nigerian Army School of Legal Services (NASLS), and the 11 Field Engineer Regiment (11 FER,) co-located at Basawa Barracks, Zaria, Kaduna State.\n\nThe COAS also charged NA personnel to sustain synergy with their counterparts from the sister services and other security agencies during Joint Operations.\n\nDuring his welcome address, the Commandant NASMP, Brigadier General Mathias Oyinmiebi Erebulu appreciated the COAS for finding time in his busy schedule to visit the school and for the recent approval for the renovation of some accommodation blocks in the barracks, following years of neglect and infrastructural decay.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Security, maintenance of Nigeria\u2019s oil pipelines gulp N32.558bn in eight months\n\nDeji Elumoye and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has said the plan to defund gas projects in the run-up to the global Net-Zero emissions target will be unhelpful to developing countries such as Nigeria.\n\nThis is coming as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) spent N32.558 billion on the security and maintenance of parts of its 5,120 kilometres of pipelines throughout the country in the first eight months of this year, data from the national oil company has shown.\n\nOsinbajo spoke on defunding of gas projects in his presentations at the High-Level UN events on the Energy Transition plan in Africa with a special focus on Nigeria ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) summit in London.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s first meeting was a closed-door session with COP26 President-Designate, Mr Alok Sharma, a cabinet rank British Minister and the Chair of the UK Government\u2019s COP26 Energy Transition Council (ETC) at Whitehall.\n\nThe discussions with Sharma centred on issues regarding the 2050 global Net-Zero emissions target and the need for the international community to align on the key elements of a just and equitable transition for all.\n\nAt the meeting, Osinbajo warned that the moves to defund gas projects would not help the whole enterprise, which required gas, especially on putting it on the grid.\n\nHe opined that the ultimate goal of the global energy transition should be to achieve reliable net-zero-energy systems to power prosperous, inclusive economies.\n\nHis words: \u201cLimiting the development of gas projects poses dire challenges for African nations, while making an insignificant dent in global emissions. Energy demand in Nigeria and across Africa is set to rise, as indeed it must, to deliver the industrialisation, jobs and economy-wide progress people deserve.\u201d\n\nHe further said Nigeria had already made a commitment to have 30 percent of its electricity supply from renewables by 2030.\n\nAccording to him, natural gas was being used for industry, fertiliser manufacturing, and cooking, which were more difficult to transition than power generation.\n\nThe vice president stressed that Nigeria was committed to all of its national determined contributions under the Paris Agreement and had updated its commitments in our new Energy Transition Plan.\n\nWhile disclosing that Nigeria was about the first African country that had developed an energy transition plan that sought to demonstrate its commitment to the global net-zero emissions, he added that in its commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the federal government was making efforts to use large shares of clean energy sources.\n\nThe vice president also had an interaction with the academic community at Imperial College followed by meetings of the Global Energy Alliance and presentations on Nigeria Energy Transition Plan and Nigeria\u2019s Integrated Energy Plan.\n\nOsinbajo said Africa as a continent was home to the world\u2019s youngest fastest growing population.\n\n\u201cIn order to create jobs and enable climate-smart industrialisation, the scale and quality of electricity services must increase significantly. This means building sustainability into our economic planning, and so our Economic Sustainability Plan, includes a plan to provide five million homes with cleaner energy through its decentralised solar power programme. This means an estimated 25 million Nigerians would have access to solar power. The first phase of this plan is already underway, and we think that this sort of programme will very quickly ramp up our progress towards net-zero emissions,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC spent N32.558 billion on the security and maintenance of parts of its 5,120 kilometres of pipelines throughout the country in the first eight months of this year, data from the national oil company has shown.\n\nA THISDAY analysis of the figures indicated that at the end of August, the NNPC had expended its entire annual security budget of N29.682 billion by N2.876 billion.\n\nThe corporation also exceeded its security and maintenance budget of N19.788 billion for January to August by N12.769 billion.\n\nThe corporation had budgeted N2.474 billion monthly for pipeline security and maintenance.\n\nIn its latest presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) detailing its activities for August, the corporation indicated that no spending was done in January regarding security and maintenance of the facilities, while N5.813 billion was spent in February.\n\nThe cost centre also gulped N5.320 billion in March and N2.641 billion in April.\n\nSimilarly, total spend for the purpose was N5.258 billion in May, while June had a higher expenditure of N6.174 billion.\n\nIn July, N7.352 billion was spent while August was zero, with the total hitting N32.558 billion as at end of August.\n\nPipelines network is an integral national asset designed several years ago to distribute crude and white products nationwide, including the movement of products from the nation\u2019s refineries to all depots as it was considered a safe and cheap means of products distribution.\n\nNNPC\u2019s pipelines are connected to 21 white product depots and tank farms across the nation, according to the Nigerian Pipelines and Storage Company Limited (NPSC), the corporation\u2019s subsidiary which manages the facilities across the country.\n\nMovement of crude and white products was done through the pipelines over the years until the act of vandalism continued to render them inefficient, with many lines now abandoned as a result of the high cost of maintenance and pipeline repair due to incessant destruction of the product lines.\n\nNigeria loses an average of 400,000 barrels of petroleum per day to theft and pipeline vandalism, although most of the oil and gas assets are also aging, thereby worsening the situation.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, recently disclosed that the 200,000 barrels of crude oil were lost per day through pipeline destruction and that it costs the country N60 billion to repair the assets each year. According to him, some 1,161 pipeline points were vandalised between January 2019 and September 2020.\n\nIn other projects\u2019 funding performance data, according to the document, the Nigeria/Morocco pipeline facility had a payment of N.583 billion made as of August 2021, leaving a deficit of N.083 billion at the end of the month.\n\nAs reported by THISDAY earlier, petrol subsidy gulped N714.791 billion at the end of August, the non-functional refineries consumed N8.3 billion during the month, as total spending on the refineries for this year alone hit N66.6 billion, out of the total budget of N100 billion for the year.\n\nIn addition, N40 billion was paid for pre-export financing as of the eighth month, out of the budgeted N60 billion, broken down into N5 billion in January, N10 billion in March, and N5 billion in April, May June, July, and August respectively.\n\nPre-export financing takes place when a financial institution advances funds to a borrower based on proven orders from buyers, with the borrower usually requiring the funding to produce and supply the goods.\n\nFor the NNPC, the corporation embarks on pre-export financing to have access to sufficient liquidity to maximise production.\n\nLast year, the United Bank for Africa (UBA) was part of a consortium that lent $1.5 billion to the corporation and its upstream, the Nigerian Petroleum Development (NPDC), providing $200 million of the amount.\n\nWhile the first $1 billion portions will be repaid over five years and is provided in dollars, the second $500 million will be in naira and repayable over seven years, while the NPDC will repay the pre-export finance facility in oil, with a commitment of 30,000 barrels per day.\n\nThe agreement also involved Standard Chartered, Afeximbank, Union Bank and two oil traders, Vitol and Nigeria\u2019s Matrix Energy.\n\nThe FAAC document further showed that renewables development was funded to the tune of N.885 billion, leaving a deficit funding of N1.148 billion, frontier exploration services consumed N20.681 billion ytd out of the N50 billion proposed for the year, leaving a funding gap of N12.652 billion.\n\nCrude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses was N3.776 billion ytd, out of a budget of N6.833 billion up until August and N10.250 billion for the entire 2021.\n\nOut of a budget of N60.920 billion for gas infrastructure development, N22.445 billion had been released at the end of August, while N18.169 billion was left as balance.\n\nFor domestic gas development, N29.056 billion had been released at the end of August, out of a total proposed package of N53.803 billion for the eight months and the complete budget of N80.705 billion for the entire year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gboyega Akinsanmi\n\nAt least 136 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and G-20 Nations at the weekend agreed to a 15 per cent corporate tax rate effective from 2023, though Nigeria withheld its assent.\n\nWith their decision, the signatories projected that the agreement would reallocate over $125 billion profits from around 100 of the world\u2019s largest and most profitable multinational enterprises (MNEs) to market jurisdictions worldwide.\n\nThe decision of the 136 countries was revealed in a joint statement on the two-pillar solutions to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the global economy.\n\nThe signatories officially entered into the agreement on Friday under the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), leaving Nigeria, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.\n\nAs shown on the website of OECD, BEPS refers to tax planning strategies used by multinational enterprises that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to avoid paying tax.\n\nBy implication, developing countries, especially Nigeria, suffer from BEPS disproportionately due to their reliance on corporate income tax means, costing them between $100 billion and $240 billion in lost revenue annually.\n\nWith a huge loss in revenue, 136 countries and jurisdictions are collaborating on the implementation of 15 measures to tackle tax avoidance, improve the coherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment.\n\nIn their statement Friday, the signatories agreed to ensure that the MNEs pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits.\n\nThe statement said major reform of the international tax system would ensure that Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) would be subject to a minimum 15 percent tax rate from 2023.\n\nIt added that the deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90 per cent of global GDP, will also reallocate more than $125 billion profits from around 100 of the world\u2019s largest and most profitable MNEs to countries worldwide.\n\nWith Estonia, Hungary, and Ireland having joined the agreement, the statement noted that all OECD and G20 countries \u201cnow support it. Four countries \u2013 Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka \u2013 have not yet joined the agreement.\n\n\u201cThe two-pillar solution will be delivered to the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Washington D.C. on October 13, then to the G20 Leaders Summit in Rome at the end of October.\n\n\u201cThe global minimum tax agreement does not seek to eliminate tax competition, but puts multilaterally agreed limitations on it, and will see countries collect around $150 billion in new revenues annually.\n\n\u201cPillar One will ensure a fairer distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries concerning the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt will re-allocate some taxing rights over MNEs from their home countries to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits, regardless of whether firms have a physical presence there,\u201d the signatories said in a joint statement released on Friday.\n\nSpecifically, the statement explained that the MNEs with global sales above \u20ac20 billion and profitability above 10 per cent \u2013 considered as the winners of globalisation \u2013 would be covered by the new rules, with 25 per cent of profit above the 10 per cent threshold to be reallocated to market jurisdictions.\n\nUnder Pillar One, the statement said taxing rights on more than $125 billion of profit \u201care expected to be reallocated to market jurisdictions each year. Developing countries\u2019 revenue gains are expected to be greater than those in more advanced economies, as a proportion of existing revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cPillar Two introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate set at 15 per cent. The new minimum tax rate will apply to companies with revenue above \u20ac750 million and is estimated to generate around $150 billion in additional global tax revenues annually.\n\n\u201cFurther benefits will also arise from the stabilisation of the international tax system and the increased tax certainty for taxpayers and tax administrations,\u201d the signatories said.\n\nOECD\u2019s Secretary-General, Mathias Cormann, was quoted in the joint statement as saying the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework would make the international tax arrangements fairer and work better.\n\nCormann said: \u201cThis is a major victory for effective and balanced multilateralism. It is a far-reaching agreement, which ensures our international tax system is fit for its purpose in a digitalised and globalised world economy.\n\n\u201cWe must now work swiftly and diligently to ensure the effective implementation of this major reform,\u201d Secretary-General Cormann said.\n\nCountries are aiming to sign a multilateral convention during 2022, with effective implementation in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe convention is already under development and will be the vehicle for implementation of the newly agreed taxing right under Pillar One, as well as for the standstill and removal provisions concerning all existing Digital Service Taxes and other similar relevant unilateral measures.\n\n\u201cThis will bring more certainty and help ease trade tensions. The OECD will develop model rules for bringing Pillar Two into domestic legislation during 2022, to be effective in 2023.\n\n\u201cDeveloping countries, as members of the Inclusive Framework on an equal footing, have played an active role in the negotiations and the Two-Pillar Solution contains some features to ensure that the concerns of low-capacity countries are addressed.\n\n\u201cThe OECD will ensure the rules can be effectively and efficiently administered, also offering comprehensive capacity-building support to countries, which need it,\u201d OECD\u2019s secretary-general was quoted saying in the joint statement by the signatory countries.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Once upon a time, the Berlin wall separated eastern Germany from western Germany, until president Ronald Reagan, in his indomitable manner, spoke lucidly on live television to the president of the then Soviet Union. He said, \u2018Mr Gorbachev, tear down this world\u2019. Mr Gorbachev eventually did and Germany is better off for it today.\n\n\u201cIn the same spirit, I say to President Muhammadu Buhari, \u2018Stop passing the ball to the national assembly. Tear down this inhibiting concoction of a constitution; tear it down so that we can build a truly great nation. This is one enduring legacy your administration can still secure before your time in power draws to a close. If you do, present and unborn generations of Nigerians will remember you for it and write your name in gold when the history of this period is written. If you don\u2019t, history will record that you failed to rise to the occasion and you squandered a great opportunity.\u2019\n\n\u201cThose clamouring for and waiting for genuine change to happen through the upcoming 2023 presidential election, without first insisting that our imposed sham of a constitution must be torn and discarded, are merely putting the cart before the horse. This is nothing but a prescription for retrogression.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBakare added that the country needs a geopolitical structure that will provide the enabling environment for every zone to maximise its economic opportunities.\n\nAccording to him, this can be achieved by a \u201cpragmatic approach to restructuring Nigeria, rather than by mere zoning of the presidency\u201d.",

Once upon a time, the Berlin wall separated eastern Germany from western Germany, until president Ronald Reagan, in his indomitable manner, spoke lucidly on live television to the president of the then Soviet Union. He said, \u2018Mr Gorbachev, tear down this world\u2019. Mr Gorbachev eventually did and Germany is better off for it today.\n\n\u201cIn the same spirit, I say to President Muhammadu Buhari, \u2018Stop passing the ball to the national assembly. Tear down this inhibiting concoction of a constitution; tear it down so that we can build a truly great nation. This is one enduring legacy your administration can still secure before your time in power draws to a close. If you do, present and unborn generations of Nigerians will remember you for it and write your name in gold when the history of this period is written. If you don\u2019t, history will record that you failed to rise to the occasion and you squandered a great opportunity.\u2019\n\n\u201cThose clamouring for and waiting for genuine change to happen through the upcoming 2023 presidential election, without first insisting that our imposed sham of a constitution must be torn and discarded, are merely putting the cart before the horse. This is nothing but a prescription for retrogression.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBakare added that the country needs a geopolitical structure that will provide the enabling environment for every zone to maximise its economic opportunities.\n\nAccording to him, this can be achieved by a \u201cpragmatic approach to restructuring Nigeria, rather than by mere zoning of the presidency\u201d.",

          "title": "Aggregators are enabling independent voices in Kenya\u2019s controlled news circuit",
          "text": "Kenya is all about the news. No, literally, \u201cHabari\u201d, a common greeting in Swahili, means \u201cAny news?\u201d in English.\n\nEveryone has their favourite publication. And every publication has a different story.\n\nData-driven digital media is taking the place of print in Kenya. As the world becomes busier and more digital, the consumption of media has changed. Emerging to take the place of rifling through the morning newspaper are scrollable, swipeable news aggregators that have the potential to change Kenya\u2019s media landscape.\n\nWho owns the headlines? The origins of Kenyan media\n\nIn a country of 52 million people, only a few formal media houses run print news. At an average cost of $0.54 per paper, reading the news can become expensive.\n\nNation Media Group publishes Daily Nation. With a daily circulation of 200,000, it stands as Kenya\u2019s most popular news publication.\n\nThe Standard Group comes in second, with three spin-offs: The Standard, The Standard on Saturday, and The Standard on Sunday. At its inception, more than 100 years ago, it was a colonial newspaper focused on British news. In 1970, African editors took over the running of the paper and shifted its focus to local reporting.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe news circuit\n\nIn an increasingly digital society, news aggregators are offering a new avenue for readers to access diversified content and human stories.\n\nNews aggregators use AI to collate news from different sources, placing them in one, central, scrollable feed. The rise of the news aggregator has, without a doubt, changed the global news industry.\n\nIn 2005, the Agence France-Presse (AFP), sued Google and sought an order barring Google from placing their content on Google News, claiming that the reproduction of the site\u2019s pictures and articles was copyright infringement. AFP and Google settled the suit and the two parties entered a licensed content deal after two years of litigation.\n\nOpera News is another digital news aggregator focused on capturing newsreaders in Africa. It sits under the Opera technology umbrella. If the name sounds familiar it\u2019s because Opera is also the creator of Opay, who raised $400 million from Softbank Vision Fund 2 in late August. The aggregator models itself after a popular app in China, Jinri Toutiao (in English, \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines\u201d). Opera News hit 10 million users in Africa in 2018 and expanded into Kenya in 2020.\n\nMuch like other aggregators, like Google News and Flipboard, Opera News\u2019 AI crawls the internet for content. But unlike other news aggregation giants, Opera News focuses on the curation of original, local, news-pulling stories from local media and fostering a band of content creators that are paid based on a set of parameters that include article clicks.\n\nPositive feedback loops\n\nAggregating digital news in an environment that tends towards the latest and greatest political stories calls for a shift in focus. In the world of news aggregation, moving the needle is as easy as a tweak in the algorithm.\n\n\u201cSome of the parameters that we had before [were] pretty much based on\u2026a lot of people are clicking this [and] our AI picks this up. So what happens is that people who are not doing that cannot get traffic\u2026\u201d said Anthory Ilari, Team Lead of Opera News East Africa.\n\nIlari found that this directly demotivated Opera News\u2019 content creators from reporting stories on broader topics in Kenya.\n\nTo deal with this, Ilari\u2019s team adjusted the algorithm to give original, non-political pieces a boost in the ranking system and feed.\n\nAlbert Bittok, a trained journalist that contributed to Opera News in his spare time, said that, from his experience, articles that received the most views and highest payout were focused on human interest and other topics like politics, sports, and agriculture.\n\nAfter a quick scroll through the headlines page on the Opera News app, TechCabal found that 35% of the headlines were non-political, focused on Kenyan celebrity gossip. On the For You page, on the other hand, 70% of the recommended posts were political in nature.\n\nAgitating aggregation\n\nBut news aggregators are not the be-all and end-all for news diversification in Kenya. Aggregators, like most technology, have their pitfalls. According to Dr. Dinesh Balliah, Acting Director of the Wits Centre for Journalism at Wits University, aggregators point to the growing need for \u201cconvenience in the global economy\u201d, but much like print media, reliance on a single aggregator can be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cNews consumers are not reading intertextually and are therefore getting a single narrative if they are reliant on a single aggregator,\u201d she wrote to TechCabal over email. \u201cAggregators, like social media platforms, must assist the news media to sustain itself,\u201d she added.\n\nNews aggregation requires constant tweaking, learning, and development in a world where millions of clicks come within a few hours. In 2020, Kenya\u2019s internet penetration rate was 85%, with 76% of the internet being accessed by cell phones. As Kenya\u2019s 2022 elections draw near, content moderation will become harder than ever and the nation\u2019s news aggregators will have to rise to the challenge.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNabsolute\u2019s SpinHeard\n\nUber\u2019s expansion\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed\n\nNabsolute\u2019s SpinHeard aims to help independent artists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\nA peculiar situation. It\u2019s interesting how a career path as a recording artist can be full of uncertainty. You start with a passion for your craft, but to stay afloat, you need to find known agents and big record labels and hope to land that dream record deal.\n\nYour biggest woe is either unheard songs or a flash in the pan success. Luck aside, how can a budding artist navigate the crowded world of music business and get exposure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what Nabsolute Media, a media communications and marketing agency based in Nigeria, is looking to do for independent artists with its recently launched platform, SpinHeard.\n\nVictor Okpala, a former music journalist and the founder of Nabsolute Media, understands the massive cost of getting one\u2019s music in front of the right crowd, especially with big name agencies.\n\nWith SpinHeard, independent artists can connect directly with listeners, learn the art of the music business with the starter kit provided when they sign up and get free social media publicity at a subsidised rate. But what\u2019s the economics of this? How does it work?\n\nOur senior reporter, Oluwanifemi, wrote a detailed feature on the SpinHeard launch. Read more here.\n\nUber is now present in five Nigerian cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? US-based technology company, Uber, known primarily for its ride-hailing service, has announced an expansion into Ibadan and Port Harcourt. With this move, the company is now present in five Nigerian cities, including Lagos, Benin City, and Abuja.\n\nAs much as these expansions mean more transportation options and employment opportunities for prospective drivers, I wonder if we would see a repeat of several events.\n\nRecall that in April, Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on a warning strike to protest the high commission fees they had to pay, which led to Uber increasing the prices for riders in Lagos.\n\nTwo-edged competition? On the one hand, competition between autonomous vehicles offering ride-hailing services and Uber is expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, because traditional cabs are much cheaper in these cities, they might retain their hold regardless of Uber\u2019s presence. And with Bolt available in 24 Nigerian cities, including Ibadan and Port Harcourt, it won\u2019t be surprising if there is stiff competition between these parties.\n\nUber\u2019s giveaway: To mark this latest foray, the platform is giving a 50% discount off eight trips with the codes MOVEIBCITY and MOVEPHCITY for riders in Ibadan and Port Harcourt, respectively.\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed round will be used to bolster cross-border payments infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nFirst, the news: Klasha, a US-based, Africa-focused cross-border payments startup, has announced raising $2.4m in seed investment.\n\nLed by American VC firm Greycroft, the round saw participation from 2.12 Angels, AVG Basecamp Fund, Berrywood Capital, Seedcamp, Plug and Play, Practical VC, MiLA Capital, First Fund, and Expert Dojo. Some Angel Investors also partook, including former TechCrunch\u2018s Head of Product, Santosh Ankola.\n\nWhat does Klasha do? Jessica Anuna founded the company in 2018 as a platform for Africans to shop for fashion items on online stores globally.\n\nAt present, however, it allows Africans to make online and offline purchases in their local currencies using cards, bank accounts, and mobile money providers like M-Pesa, while the merchants receive payment in their currencies in two business days.\n\nThe startup also partners with third-party logistics companies to help merchants in Europe and the US ship to Africa in five to nine working days.\n\nNotable eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart have integrated Klasha\u2019s plugins, with the startup also having an official partnership with BigCommerce.\n\nWith this seed financing, the startup wants to build plugin libraries that will be integrated into platforms like Zara, ASOS, and H&M to enable payments across Africa. Also, plans to foray beyond Nigeria into three African countries are underway.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Attention Diet. Read.\n\nCrazy New Ideas.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to be an average independent artiste, trying to work your way into the limelight or get proper attention? It could involve gate-crashing events looking to get noticed by a record label or putting in the effort to gain financial or mentorship opportunities \u2014 basically, trying to get the right contacts.\n\nFor most artistes, balancing creativity and business could be an uphill task. While the former could be what someone likes to do, the latter is not always within the control of an artiste. When it becomes challenging to get the right contacts to showcase one\u2019s talents, those that can afford it use the services of public relations agencies \u2014 whose rates can be pretty expensive \u2014 to get the exposure.\n\nNabsolute Media, a Nigerian media communications and marketing agency, is one of these companies. However, after running for a little above two years and handling rollout for famous clientele, the business has decided to make communications options open to independent artistes at an affordable rate with the launch of its platform, SpinHeard.\n\nWhy SpinHeard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpinHeard is the next frontier for us. We\u2019re trying to automate what we do for a lot of artists,\u201d former music journalist and founder of Nabsolute, Victor Okpala, tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a person who had to stick his neck out in the early days to get someone to bet on his capabilities, Okpala understands the importance of having a viable platform and the right contacts.\n\nStill, he believes that the times have become nicer such that the deal-breaker could just be time and chance. And the likelihood that exposure could come in easier ways has repeated itself as music becomes mainstream with the Internet.\n\nThis Harvard Business Review (HBR) piece makes a bold statement about the power of luck in any business. And Okpala strongly agrees with this, especially in music.\n\nA more recent case is how 17-year-old Salle\u2019s music broke the Internet and attracted huge attention, even from CNN, in less than a month. The young Nigerian\u2019s short performance was captured and posted by someone who\u2019d heard of her talents, and for her, that was all she needed.\n\nBut what are the odds if artistes leave it all to luck?\n\nWhile Nabsolute leverages storytelling, tech tools, and a network of influencers to amplify and market content within the creative industry, Okpala admits that these services might not be affordable for the average independent artist.\n\n\u201cWe know that an agency like Nabsolute is elite, which means there\u2019s a cost that comes with it if you want us to do a job for you.\u201d\n\nFor instance, running an entire campaign for four weeks could cost up to $1,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that is a fee that a lot of independent artistes cannot afford,\u201d Okpala explains, \u201cThis group makes up a large percentage of the industry. This means we have a big market that we can\u2019t help. We needed to extend our solution to more people.\u201d\n\nGiven what this process entails, the burden would be massive on the agency and might not be economical for someone with a lean budget. Hence, a need to automate all these processes on a platform.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a platform that will help independent artistes to break the barrier to music curators \u2014 journalists, OAPs, influencers, DJs \u2014 across all levels.\u201d After all, for him, \u201cevery song deserves a fair chance of being heard.\u201d\n\nHow SpinHeard works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking coverage across different platforms can be a monumental task. Even though the two-year-old business has built a name for itself and has a ready network of \u2018doers\u2019 that can be onboarded, I expressed my worries about the risk of these employees getting a heavier workload for less pay.\n\nAccording to Okpala, SpinHeard comes with incentives for these curators, especially to simplify their jobs. The web app will include tools that will organise and automatically prioritise requests based on release dates, deadlines, genre, regions, and other sorting attributes.\n\nA SpinHeard account can be owned by an artist, a manager, or a curator.\n\nThink of Upwork but for music creators and curators. A platform where artistes can pitch directly to people to get their content across to listeners. What is more significant than an assurance that people will hear them?\n\nThe platform also contains some starter kits that could help artists present their pitches in acceptable formats. This includes press release guides, pitch templates, and press kit templates.\n\nGiven SpinHeard\u2019s value offering, Okpala says the attached costs will be hugely subsidised compared to the standard PR cost. However, since the product is still in its beta phase, the charge is yet to be defined.\n\nBut Okpala makes an interesting case for getting your craft under the radar of an influencer or an OAP with $1, without having to worry about rejection, as long as the quality of the work is good. If the pitch is ignored, there is also a chance to get a refund.\n\nAsides from that, there is an option to pitch for free, with the decision to feature left to the curator\u2019s discretion.\n\nFor starters, SpinHeard will help independent artistes upload their content to the popular video-sharing app, Triller and get promoted for free, of course, after content vetting.\n\nOkpala talks about how this leverages an existing partnership between the social networking platform and Nabsolute. This would expose these independent artistes to the perks the company already offers clients it runs comms for \u2014 in terms of push notifications, banner support, and other home page features.\n\nOkpala confirms that curators will be onboarded later this month; this will arrive along with payment features.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economics of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s in it for Nabsolute.\n\nLike every new venture, profit isn\u2019t the main goal for now. Okpala believes that starting Nabsolute is risk enough, so the initial focus is on onboarding. Sometimes, the reward might have to come from testimonials telling of the impact on the independent artiste who might have gone unheard without a platform like SpinHeard.\n\nStill, as a business, there\u2019s a plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pad the agency service charge into what users pay to the curators through a percentage share. The model is going to be the typical split-share percentage.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is yet to be decided. The company is still in talks with the curator community, and Okpala can\u2019t confirm if these rates and percentage commission would vary from one curator to another.\n\nWhile his expectations aren\u2019t lofty, Okpala speaks of this product as a risk worth taking since it is the first in the industry, and the company would be willing to experience both the first-mover advantage alongside its disadvantages.\n\nWith an initial focus on Nigeria, the platform would ultimately be open to artists across the globe.\n\nOkpala and his love for music and storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a music head,\u201d Okpala recalls.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story, so I probe further. After all, loving music doesn\u2019t always translate to being passionate about telling the story behind a song.\n\n\u201cI had an issue with the way music was being released. I felt like there was no storytelling interwoven in the rollout processes, and people could do better. Rollout felt like an afterthought compared to what happens in the US and other countries,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut he could not act on this until he founded Nabsolute, a story to be told later. In the meantime, let\u2019s talk about what he did before then.\n\nOkpala opens up about a phenomenal change that a Kanye West song gave him in 2016 during a challenging time.\n\n\u201cThere was a part in the song, titled \u2018Waves\u2019, that felt like somebody was gasping for air,\u201d he pauses to imitate a beat, \u201cand that particular part of the song felt like it was me trying to find expression for something inside me that there were no words for.\u201d\n\nAnd the song helped him break out of what he would later get to know was depression.\n\nBefore officially becoming a journalist with Lagos-based online news and entertainment company, thenet.ng in September 2017, Okpala reviewed songs on his YouTube channel. He often criticised people\u2019s works, holding strong opinions, which he says have become more objective.\n\n\u201cI have always done my thing on YouTube. Documenting music, doing album breakdowns and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut his issue with the lack of storytelling in music rollout lingered in his mind.\n\nWhile working as a reporter, he felt something was missing, and the void needed to be filled. Okpala decided he had to be more active than just writing about music. So, he took a bold step; at that point, he had made quite a name for himself on the entertainment reporting scene.\n\nFor his first shot, he handled a project by Seyi Shay called Electric Package. He happened to be at the album listening event, where he approached her former manager, Kamal Ajiboye, offering to help them do better. He weaved a story around the EP\u2019s release and rolled it out with a mini-documentary that formed the backstory.\n\nThe success of the project gave him the clarity he had always looked for.\n\n\u201cThat was how I knew that what I was going to do next was to run a communications agency.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, he resigned and founded Nabsolute in July. Nabsolute is coined from the phrase, \u2018Not a Basic Solution\u2019, which he lived by while conceptualising what else to do. So far, the company has acquired notable clients like Runtown, Ycee, Reekado Banks, Skales, Darey Art Alade, K1 De Ultimate, among others.\n\nDespite the success recorded with Nabsolute, Okpala doesn\u2019t expect SpinHeard to be a walk in the park. And, in figuring out how to get things done, he and his team will make peace with the outcome.\n\nSo, fingers crossed. What do you think about this product?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\neNaira and private blockchains\n\nGoogle\u2019s $1b plan for Africa\n\nChari\u2019s $5m seed raise\n\nThe eNaira dilemma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria revealed its plans to launch eNaira on October 1, 2021, it also said it would be using a private blockchain \u2014 The Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing, a private blockchain means there\u2019s no room for transparency. And although blockchain is known for its security and decentralisation, when it\u2019s private, whoever is in control of it can manipulate records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not use a public blockchain? That could work, of course, but that would mean sacrificing speed, amongst other things.\n\nWhat would a private blockchain entail for the eNaira? Are there alternatives?\n\nThese questions and more have been answered. Click here: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nGoogle plans to invest $1b towards a digital Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, Google announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa to support digital transformation in the next five years.\n\nThe announcement was made by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, at the company\u2019s first-ever Google for Africa event.\n\nHow will it happen? Well, the money will be distributed across different sectors \u2014 including eCommerce and telecommunications \u2014 with Google partnering with other African companies as well.\n\nFor example, a subsea cable dubbed Equiano would be built to enable affordable Internet access. It would run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena to connect the continent with Europe. A Device Financing plan would also be implemented.\n\nDevice Financing? Yes. Google says affordable Internet is good, but in the grand scheme of things, being able to buy cheap data would mean nothing if you can\u2019t afford a phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, free iPhones? Well, it\u2019s definitely going to be Androids, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on something fancy. However, the Device Financing plan will be in partnership with Safaricom and will start in Kenya.\n\nIt will be expanded across other parts of Africa through partners including Airtel, M-KOPA, MTN, and Orange. According to Google, \u201cThese partnerships will help millions of first-time smartphone users gain access to quality, affordable Android smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnything else? Google plans to launch the Africa Investment Fund to invest $50 million in African startups. It will also be providing $10 million in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nNon- profits solving different challenges in African communities will also receive $40 million to keep up the good work.\n\nSo, why the generosity? \ud83e\udd14 According to Pichai, the company wants to make \u201cthe Internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen companies like Facebook investing in providing Africa with better Internet with its 2Africa subsea Internet cable, but with Africa\u2019s projected population of 2.2 billion by 2045, are these acts of kindness just investment in potential customers?\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, gives a detailed analysis on the subsea Internet cable here: With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa\n\nChari closes $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari Co-Founder. (L-R) Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat. Source: Supplied\n\nMoroccan B2B eCommerce startup, Chari, has announced the close of a $5 million seed at a $70 million valuation to expand into more African countries.\n\nThe seed funding saw investments from Rocket Internet, Plug and Play, Y Combinator, and Orange Ventures, among others.\n\nWhat does Chari do? The startup is digitising the distribution of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) from local manufacturers to local mom and pop stores.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, the duo got the idea for Chari during a trip to understand how FMCG worked in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered how hard it was for mom and pop stores to get their products and decided to make things easier.\n\nPer TechCrunch, small shops order products via the startup\u2019s mobile app and receive them in less than 24 hours.\n\nIt also partners with FMCG Multinationals like American Consumer Goods company, Procter & Gamble (P&G), giving exclusive access to some products.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, \u201cP&G works with Chari exclusively. So in case any other player wants to sell P&G products, either they have to go through Chari, or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,\u201d\n\neCommerce in North Africa: eCommerce startups in the region have been on the radar of investors for some time now. We\u2019ve seen massive funding and acquisitions like MaxAB\u2019s $40 million funding and its purchase of WaystoCap\n\nChari plans to expand into Francophone Africa and offer more financial services.

          "text": "Petroleum tanker drivers suspend tomorrow\u2019s strike in the week ahead\n\nThe National Union of Petroleum and Gas Workers (NUPENG) on Sunday said that the planned strike by its affiliate members, Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), has been suspended.\n\nTayo Aboyeji, the South-West Zonal chairman of NUPENG, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos.\n\nAccording to Aboyeji, the suspension is to allow the union\u2019s representatives and that of the government to address the knotty issues at stake.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the union after a brief meeting with representatives of government decided to suspend the strike in the interest of the nation.\u201d\n\nIkeja Electric customers to experience outages in the week ahead\n\nIkeja Electric Plc has announced that some areas under its operational network will experience outages for a period of eight weeks to enable the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to re-conduct its 132KV lines.\n\nOlajide Kumapayi, chief technical officer, Ikeja Electric, made the announcement at a news briefing on Monday in Ikeja, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nKumapayi said the project which would begin on Oct. 11 was aimed at increasing the capacity of the transmission lines to wheel more power from the generation companies.\n\nHe noted that some of the 132K lines installed over 50 years ago had become obsolete and degraded due to time and usage.\n\nAccording to him, areas that will be affected by this stage of the project include Oregun, Police Training College, Oba Akran, Oke Ira, Ogba, Magodo, Anifowoshe, and Omole Phase One.\n\n\u201cThis will affect all categories of customers within the area especially our Maximum Demand (MD) customers such as Ikeja City Mall, Police College, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital and the Ikeja High Court,\u201d Kumpayi said.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, the substations controlling these areas will be switched off which will affect the feeders connected to them,\u201d he added.\n\nFully vaccinated Nigerians can travel to the UK without pre-departure tests in the week ahead\n\nThe UK government announced that fully vaccinated travellers from Nigeria can travel to England without needing a pre-departure covid test from the 11th of October.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by the British High Commission, in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nThey also revealed that the policy includes Nigerians vaccinated with the AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Modern and Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\n\u201cFully vaccinated means that you have had a complete course of an approved vaccine at least 14 days before you arrive in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe day you had your final dose does not count as one of the 14 days. You must be able to prove that you have been fully vaccinated under a vaccination programme and have valid proof of vaccination recognised by the British Government (for Nigeria, the certificates with valid QR codes as issued by Nigeria\u2019s Primary Healthcare Development Agency are recognised),\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: The Week Ahead\n\nBen Llewellyn-Jones, Acting High Commissioner to Nigeria said, \u201cThe exemption of fully vaccinated Nigerians travelling to the Uk from providing a pre-departure test and self-isolating for 10 days, is a very welcome development.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo make this happen, we have been working closely with Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency on recognising Nigeria\u2019s vaccine certification, which we have now done.\u201d\n\nOil prices up more than 4% for the week on the back of the global energy crunch\n\nOil fell on Monday ahead of an OPEC+ supply policy meeting that may decide whether a recent rally in prices can be sustained as the world fitfully recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOPEC+ on Monday decided to maintain an agreement to increase oil production only gradually, ignoring calls from the United States and India to boost output as the world economy recovers, though patchily, from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors on Thursday increased their oil price forecast for the medium term to $50-$70 a barrel range, returning to its outlook before the pandemic, on the back of expected restraint in production growth and continuous rebound in demand.\n\nOil prices rose on Friday, up more than 4% on the week as a global energy crunch has boosted prices to their highest since 2014 and prompted China to demand increased coal production. Brent had a weekly growth of 4.86%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish buoyed by global energy crunch.\n\nCurrency Market\n\nFor most of the trading session last week the Naira depreciated at the I & E FX window, which continued at the end of the week. On a week-on-week (W-on-W) basis, the Naira fell by +0.22% to N414.30/US$ at the close of trading on Friday.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N414.30 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N412.71 as of 7th September 2021.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N415/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney Market\n\nTrading was mixed for most of the session last week, we had single-digit rates and double-digit rates supported by inflow and outflow of liquidity in the markets\n\nHowever, at the close of the session on Friday, money market rates closed in double digits, at 14.00% and 14.5% for open buy-back (OBB) and overnight rates (O/N) respectively. On a W-o-W basis, OBB fell by -6.67% while O/N also dropped by -7.94%.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any inflow.\n\nTreasury Bills Market\n\nThe bills market started the previous week on a quiet note, however, for a major part of trading, we saw mixed sentiment across the market.\n\nAt the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T-bills closed at 5.27%, OMO bills at 6.47%, and CBN\u2019s special bills closed at 6.04%. Posting a W-o-W fall of -0.36% for the T-bills, while OMO bills and CBN\u2019s special bills rose W-o-W by +2.41%, and +0.08% respectively.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond Market\n\nThe FGN bond market started the previous week on a bullish note, however, the bullish sentiment was not sustained throughout the week.\n\nThe overall average benchmark yields closed at 8.13% at the close of trading at the end of the week.\n\nThe Eurobond market has had a bearish bias for most of the trading session last week, influenced majorly by the higher US Treasury yields as investors moved to that market to take advantage of the higher yields.\n\nAt the close of the trading on Friday, average benchmark yields fell by -0.09% from the previous session to 6.40%\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft in the near term in the absence of any trigger.\n\nNigerian Capital Market\n\nActivity on the local bourse last week was positive as the benchmark index closed positive with +0.10% with some bargain hunting activities and sell-off in the insurance sector. The Nigerian Stock Exchange gained N340.287bn, year-to-date return moderated to +1.48%, while the market capitalization settled at N21.30 trillion.\n\nThe volume of shares traded declined by -0.34% while the value of stocks traded on the exchange last week advanced by +35.71% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was positive last week as the NGX Banking was the highest gainer for the previous week with +4.53%. NGX Insurance recorded the highest weekly loss with -1.51%. NGX Oil and Gas NGX, NGX-IND, and NGX Consumer Goods closed positive with +0.24%, +0.11% and -0.51% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 42 gainers led by UPL and FBNH as against 26 losers led by CORNERST and MORISON\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains; however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.",

          "title": "2023: How PDP chairmanship zoning to North fires up presidency zoning discourse",
          "text": "Since Thursday, October 8, 2021, when the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) adopted the zoning of its chairmanship position to the north, upholding the recommendations of the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led zoning committee, the political scene has been thrown into a frenzy of sorts in the discourse around presidency zoning ahead of 2023.\n\nThere were indications at the venue of the meeting that the decision did not go down well with certain members of the party or so it seemed.\n\nFor instance, there were reports of some protesters displaying placards with various inscriptions, such as: \u201cStop cheating the North,\u201d \u201cWike brought Sheriff, Wike brought Secondus, now he wants to truncate the turn of the North;\u201d \u201cPDP, give North their rights,\u201d and \u201cTwo years of North vs 13 years of South.\u201d\n\nReacting to the party\u2019s decision, which apparently indicated that it is now looking towards South for its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, a former vice president on the party platform, and the PDP\u2019s presidential candidate in 2019, urged the party to pay attention to where it is zoning the presidency.\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a President from Southern Nigeria or a President from Northern Nigeria. There is only one fact, a president from Nigeria, for Nigeria and by Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe adoption of the recommendations was the high point of the 94th NEC meeting of the party held in Abuja.\n\nBefore the Abuja NEC meeting, the 44-member Zoning Committee of the party headed by Governor Ugwuanyi had met in Enugu on Thursday, September 30, 2021, where it took a decision to zone the national chairmanship of the party to the north.\n\nUgwuanyi had explained that the mandate of the committee did not include zoning of offices of the president, vice president, and other executive and legislative offices of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe decision of the committee to zone the offices of the party does not in any way affect the same executive and legislative offices in Nigeria. The zoning of offices in PDP has traditionally been between the North and the south of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUgwuanyi further said: \u201cThe decision of the PDP zoning committee is in line with the constitution of the party on zoning and rotation of party, and national offices in the interest of justice, equity and fairness. Consequently, the current offices being held by officers in the Southern zone of the country, namely, South West, South East and South-South zones should swap places with offices currently in the Northern zone of Nigeria, namely, North West, North East, and North Central zones.\u201d\n\nPolitical Scientist and Analyst, Kunle Okunola said the PDP decision may just be an indication of where the party would zone the presidency to in 2023 and also reflect the mood of the nation.\n\n\u201cIt shows that the PDP is in tandem with the political mood of the people because it is an indication that its presidential candidate would definitely come from the South for the sake of equity in the party.\n\nRead Also: PDP zones party national chairman to North\n\n\u201cThe zoning of the party\u2019s national chairman to the North would force the ruling Northern APC leaders to reconsider their stand on where the APC Presidential candidate comes from because if the APC still wants the president to come from the North, it would affect their chances in 2023 and as well deepen the division currently experienced in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWith this invariably, the APC might not have a choice than to zone its presidential seat to the South so that the PDP will not benefit from the mood of the nation on zoning.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, PDP took a wide decision and it may benefit from the decision strongly if the stakeholders unite to swing the voting mood of the electorate come 2023.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the political scientist said a Southerner would likely become the next president, while the North will still remain the determinant of who succeeds President Buhari in 2023.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cLooking from the intrigues going on in both APC and PDP, the South might be the electoral battleground while the North would determine who among the candidates from the South would become the President. In this way, the North will still remain the determinant of who succeeds President Buhari in 2023.\n\n\u201cAlthough, where the president comes from should not be the major factor but policy agenda and how much of economic ideas and leadership qualities, should play key role.\u201d\n\nApparently, responding to the move by the PDP, some politicians in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have begun to go public with their support for Ahmed Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State, who is being touted to nurse a presidential ambition.\n\nLast Thursday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State launched a political group for Tinubu\u2019s 2023 presidential ambition, although the APC has not made public its zoning arrangements.\n\nThe group, named \u201cSWAGA\u201d was inaugurated in Ikeja to kick off campaign activities for Tinubu, who reportedly returned to the country a few days ago, after some months\u2019 absence on medical trip abroad.\n\nSince last week also, there have been several names being propped up by different groups and individuals as possible presidential materials on PDP and APC platforms.\n\nThe decision of the PDP to zone the national chairmanship position to the North zone has continued to generate debate in the polity in the last few days.\n\nPerhaps, the heightened public interest in the main opposition party\u2019s decision came amid increasing debate across Nigeria among political leaders on which region should produce a successor to the incumbent president Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nA few days ago, the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum had met with notable traditional rulers and other stakeholders in Kaduna, where they opposed the call by their Southern counterpart that the presidency should be zoned to the South in 2023.\n\nThe Northern Governors\u2019 position had attracted wide criticism, especially from leaders and governors in the South, who had consistently maintained that it was the turn of the region to produce Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\nIn the last few months, the issue of zoning the 2023 presidency, party offices, coupled with internal supremacy battle among leaders had threatened the future and stability of the PDP.\n\nThree governors and several chieftains have defected to the ruling APC since the crisis started.\n\nThe crisis has deeply affected the party\u2019s ability to play the role of an opposition effectively, leading to increasing fear about its ability to challenge the APC in 2023 general election.\n\nLast year, the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, defected to the ruling APC over fears that the PDP may not be willing to zone the presidency to the South-East in 2023.\n\nUmahi had complained that the party was not fair to the region despite the huge support and votes it got there.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere are a lot of qualified people from the South-East. Some people say I was promised lots of things by the APC, there was no such discussion. APC never promised me any position; they never promised the South-East any position.\n\n\u201cHowever, I offered this movement as a protest to injustice being done to the South-East by the PDP. Since 1999, the South-East has supported the PDP. At a time, the five states were all PDP. One of the founding members of the PDP was from South-East, the late former Vice President, Alex Ekwueme.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is absurd that since 1999 going to 2023, the South-East will never be considered to run for presidency under the PDP. And this is my position and will continue to be my position. It had nothing to do with me or my ambition,\u201d Umahi further said.\n\nSeveral leaders and political groups within the South-East have equally warned the party on the implication of not choosing its presidential candidate from the region.\n\nThey said they would have no choice but to tell their people to vote for any other political party which gives its presidential ticket to a South Eastener.\n\nChekwas Okorie, a former national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) had warned the two major parties in the South East, that the people were tired of being used and abandoned.\n\nHe added that it would not accept any position other than the presidency from the two major parties in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved that any party that gives the presidential ticket to Igbo man in 2023 would get the votes of Igbos massively across the country and that is our priority ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cEverything looks favourable for the South to be considered for the APC ticket. But when you now talk about the South, the Yorubas have had their turn when Obasanjo ruled for eight years, after that we had Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan tenure, we know that Jonathan moved on to rule for six years.\n\n\u201cSo, it is only the South East and for the interest of the equity, it is appropriate that the region gets the president slot in 2023. But the way I am seeing it, the PDP may not zone the presidency to the South East in 2023,\u201d Okorie had said.\n\nThough zoning is unconstitutional in Nigeria, political leaders say it was only the solution to equal opportunity for the three major ethnic groups to have an opportunity to govern the country.\n\nSome leaders across Nigeria have, however, kicked against the idea of zoning; they said competence should rather decide who assumes public office.",

          "title": "Desperate moment in South East",
          "text": "In recent times, the once peaceful South-East geopolitical zone of Nigeria has been in the news for the wrong reasons.\n\nFrom herdsmen attacks, to the activities of secessionist group, Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB), resulting in clashes with security agents, wanton killing of innocent citizens, destruction of private and public properties by \u201cunknown gunmen,\u201d and the sit-at-home orders being issued by IPOB. These have all combined to raise the bar of insecurity in the zone.\n\nAccording to reports, between January and April 19, 2021, over 17 police stations, in addition to a correctional facility, have been targeted by the gunmen, leaving in their trail dead officers, charred police stations, freed prison inmates, and empty armoury. Some offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have also been torched across the zone.\n\nUnspecified number of people has been killed in the confusion that has enveloped the zone.\n\nGenerally, insecurity in the zone has become a serious concern, particularly with the Anambra State gubernatorial election holding in less than a month\u2019s time.\n\nThe assassination of Chike Akunyili, husband of Dora Akunyili, the late director-general of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control of Nigeria (NAFDAC) and minister, alongside eight others in Onitsha, Anambra State, a few days ago, observers say, has raised the apprehension level in the zone.\n\nThe sad development in Anambra has pitted the state government against Abuja, following the Federal Government\u2019s threat of imposition of emergency rule in the state.\n\nWhile the state government is claiming that the Federal Government was merely creating a panic situation to hijack the state and forcefully install an APC-led government, Abuja accuses the state government of failing in its primary duty of protecting lives and property.\n\nSome high ranking federal lawmakers from the zone are also pointing fingers at the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Federal Government for the gale of unwarranted assassinations in the zone in recent times.\n\nEnyinnaya Abaribe, a senator representing Abia Central, suggested that some persons may be trying to turn Anambra State into a theatre of murder, assassinations in order to create the impression that the state is unsafe for voters to come out to cast their votes during the forthcoming governorship election.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us say that what is going on in the South East is something that we cannot just comprehend properly.\n\n\u201cPeople in the South East have never been violent and we are not murderers and part of the confusion is that we don\u2019t know who is committing these crimes.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe know that there\u2019s an election coming I think in 35 days and the feeling is that they should turn the state into a theatre of murder, assassinations maybe to create the impression that it is so unsafe that nobody should come out to vote.\n\n\u201cAnd we are calling on the security agencies that this is the time they should actually do a serious investigation into this. Drawing conclusions saying it\u2019s this group or that group, this person or that person does not help anybody.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the growing insecurity in the zone, Utibe Ibiam, a constitutional lawyer and former lawmaker in Akwa Ibom State, said that since the Biafran war, the Federal Government has not been fair to the South East zone, and using its operatives to hit up the zone is the worse the tribe can experience now as every killing is blamed on unknown gunmen.\n\n\u201cYes, people blame the governors for not bracing up to their responsibilities, but don\u2019t forget that most of them were forced on the people by the court and are in power to do the bidding of their sponsors-Federal Government,\u201d Ibiam said.\n\nToeing Ibiam\u2019s line, Anele Oguezi, an associate professor at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State, alleged that the killings are both politically motivated and perpetrated by government operatives just to destabilise the zone for possible takeover, which he insisted was the worst from a government that has no interest in developing the zone.\n\n\u201cThere has been a plot to hijack the leadership of Igboland by their enemies. But the Igbos are strongly resisting that and what is happening now is a result of that sustained resistance, and any well-meaning Igbo leaders should not allow outsiders to use them to achieve that purpose,\u201d Oguezi said.\n\nRead Also: South East security meeting condemns killings, sit-at-home orders\n\nHe argued that with the insecurity in Ebonyi and Imo states, which are controlled by the ruling party, there is no guarantee of peace in any Igbo state that the party is fighting and manipulating to win.\n\n\u201cI see the Anambra killings as politically motivated violence. But my greatest regret will be for Igbo politicians who will allow themselves to be used by the ruling party, which has not shown any interest in the development of the zone other than thousands of military checks, harassing and intimidation of Igbos in their land. Okorocha, Uzodinma and Kalu should serve as examples. It is all about using you to get what they want at the expense of your people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018State of emergency threat hypocritical\u2019\n\nOn the threat by Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the Federation and minister of justice, of imposing a state of emergency on Anambra State if the new spate of violence persists, many observers called the threat hypocritical as his state and many north-west and north-east states are experiencing the worst insecurity situations, yet no contemplation of emergency rule in such places.\n\nComparing the insecurity in the north east and north west zones with the situations in the South-East, Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, said that the Federal Government was not fair with the South-East zone in many areas, a developing, which according to him, is making many to suspect ulterior motive in the state of emergency threat of the government.\n\n\u201cIf you allow the South-East to operate in their own way, they will overrun the so-called gunmen or DSS operatives in their zone. I used to visit Onitsha, Nnewi and Aba, the major commercial hubs in the zone, for UNESCO research projects and it was in the days of \u2018Bakassi Boys\u2019 and I saw how they used their unconventional methods to rid the zone of criminals. They can do the same now with the gunmen and that is what those behind the killings do not want,\u201d Onikoyi said.\n\nJideofor Ezeokonkwo, one of the market leaders in Anambra State, assured that the state is not for the highest bidders and that they will not surrender to government sponsored assassins no matter how many they kill every day.\n\n\u201cWhat is politics? Do we depend on the government? Every development in Anambra and Igboland is sponsored by the indigenes; so why is the government killing people it never cares for? They should allow us to carry our own arms and let\u2019s see how DSS will kill us without killing some of them in our own land. The government should leave Anambra and Igboland alone, don\u2019t use our sons against us,\u201d he observed.\n\nChuka Achusi, a engineer, artificial intelligence expert and an indigene of Ukpo, Anambra State, believed that the strategies of the ruling party and northern oligarchy are bent on breaking the last stronghold in Igboland, and that it would not be easy as the people would not bend; the state is prepared and the trouble would affect the whole country it comes.\n\n\u201cWhy is the Federal Government interested in Igboland, a people that don\u2019t get any benefit from government; a people hated because they expressed their legitimate right to be alone? We know the killings are to destabilise the state and possibly take over the leadership, but it will not work, because we are resilient to death.\n\nIn an 8-paragraph statement in response to Malami\u2019s threat, C. Don Adinuba, commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Anambra State, said: \u201cIt seems that since these politicians have proved unable to intimidate the Anambra people from coming out to participate in the vote, they have resolved to impose emergency rule on the state. Not up to 15 persons have lost their lives since the new spectre of violence in the state. For a state that has for the past seven years enjoyed the well-deserved reputation of being Nigeria\u2019s safest and most peaceful state, this number is pretty high.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is absolutely not even a fraction of the casualties the nation has seen in places like Borno, Zamfara, Katsina, Benue, Plateau, Yobe, Niger, Adamawa, Taraba, and others where terrorists have not only killed several thousands of civilians but also successfully attacked military formations and slaughtered soldiers and other security officers. They have even brought down some sophisticated combat aircraft. Were elections not held successfully in these states in 2019?\u201d he said.\n\nWe want to be treated like any other part of the country \u2013 Umahi\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television Wednesday, a day after the meeting of the South East Governor\u2019s Forum and other stakeholders in Enugu the previous day, on security issues, Governor Dave Umahi said, over the years, the issue of marginalisation has been in the psyche of the people.\n\nThe governor said the desire of the Igbo nation was to be accorded their rights in Nigeria and be treated like other parts of the country.\n\nUmahi noted that the agitation had been hijacked by hoodlums, cultists, criminals and politicians who are using it to further their personal agenda. \u201cIt is now a bit complicated,\u201d he admitted.\n\nHe explained that Igbos in the Diaspora, who had been bitter over the situation of things in Nigeria and the continued marginalisation of the South East, decided to buy into IPOB philosophy.\n\nHe also noted that as time went on, some other criminals came into the matter, hiding under IPOB; then the issue of herdsmen worsened the situation. IPOB set up the ESN to check the activities of herdsmen in the South East and it was also hijacked.\n\nWhen confronted with the question of failure governance on South East or loopholes on the part of the security agencies and governors who are the chief security officers of their states, Umahi said the governors were doing their best and that the security agencies were also doing their bit. He however, pointed out that the number of security personnel was far too small to police the area.\n\nOn why it seems that the South East people appear to obey the orders of IPOB rather than those of elected political leaders, which indicates a vote of no confidence in their governors, Umahi said: \u201cPeople are not sitting at home out of obedience or compliance but out of fear. People are afraid to speak out openly for fear of isolated killing which has been happening.\u201d\n\nThe governor emphasised that \u201cWe don\u2019t want Biafra; what we want is to be treated like any other part of the country; just to have an equitable government.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who spoke again Friday in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital, during a prayer summit organised by the state government at the Christian Ecumenical Centre, emphasised the need for the presidency to be zoned to the South East to assuage the anger of the people.\n\n\u201cAnd let me state very clearly, zoning or no zoning party or no party, South East must not be schemed out of the affairs of this nation; it must not be schemed out.\n\n\u201cWhat is good for other states, is good for the South East, it doesn\u2019t matter whom God enthrones. Let the South East be properly integrated into the affairs of this nation. We are nation builders; we should not be left out.\n\n\u201cWe have investments in every part of this country and people use hate speeches to keep us down, people should not be afraid of us,\u201d he said.\n\nKunle Okunade, political analyst, said that the South East could be responding to the marginalisation in the current administration of Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cLooking back at the security situation in the South East since 2015, it will be right to say that the geopolitical zone is responding to the lopsided way and manner the current federal government is governing the country in their own best way of reacting.\n\n\u201cIn a heterogeneous country like Nigeria, insecurity and politics go hand in hand because most often insecurity of such kind is fuelled by political elite who are believed to have been side-lined in the political system. Although, they always make it look like it was fuelled by bad governance.\n\n\u201cI want to believe that the security crisis is politically motivated to achieve a myopic benefit which is not people-oriented. I would be surprised if the situation continues till 2023 when this administration would be rounding off.\u201d\n\nBut no going back on Anambra election \u2013 INEC\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the Anambra gubernatorial election would hold despite the threat posed by insecurity.\n\nAmid the tense atmosphere and ongoing agitations in Anambra, Mahmood Yakubu, the Commission\u2019s chairman, at the emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES), recently assured indigenes and Nigerians at large, that the Commission was determined to proceed with the election as scheduled.\n\n\u201cWe wish to assure the people of Anambra State that the commission intends to proceed with the election as scheduled,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe INEC Chairman also restated his assurances Friday at an emergency meeting of political parties and the Commission in Abuja, saying that \u201cAlready, security around INEC facilities in the state has been ramped up. We are also confident that the heightened deployment of security officials, which is expected in the coming weeks, will further give citizens the confidence to turn up and vote on Election Day. We shall continue to work with the security agencies to ensure that the election is successful and violence-free.\u201d",

Over the years, the innovation cluster has attracted multiple local and international partnerships to launch thousands of young people in Edo State into careers in technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome international organizations that are already in partnership with Edo State Skills Development Agency in this regard include Amazon, Microsoft and ButterflyWorks,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki said with the progress made in driving technology and innovation through Edo Innovates, it has become vital to set up a board to help place the hub strategically in the heart of the government\u2019s promise to the Edo youths.\n\nHe noted that the key purpose of the Edo Innovates Board of Directors is to serve as the overarching layer in the governance structure of Edo Innovates, providing strategic policy guidance, strengthening the governance structure to re-assure existing and new stakeholders and support the government\u2019s objectives of a thriving hub.\n\nHe said some of the government\u2019s objectives for the board is to \u201cEstablish a PPP model for the hub; encourage and support private sector participation in the delivery of skills and other activities of Edo Innovates; oversee the ongoing activities and perform an institutional review of Edo Innovates; attract more world-class partners to increase investment in building talent in the state and scale up existing initiatives to other locations within the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cIn order to achieve this, the Board will be overseeing the implementation of the World Bank EdoBEST DLIs, which are focused on strengthening the good work going on at Edo Innovates.\n\n\u201cOne of our priorities for the EdoBEST project is the establishment of two additional hubs and it is important that they remain under an umbrella body that can provide transparent governance, especially with the issuance of grant funding.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to the establishment of private sector partnerships to leverage the resources and expertise of global and regional tech companies, foundations, and innovation networks to attract new skills development and entrepreneurship programmes to Edo State.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this team will advise me on more ways to position the state to deliver digital skills and entrepreneurship training programs that are aligned with private sector needs.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt was the first few days of December, 2015 and the weather was still too chilly with the early signs of Harmattan.\n\nI got an SMS from a number saying I had been admitted to study Film at the National Film Institute, Jos.\n\nIt was such an exhilarating experience. Finally, I was going to make something of my passion for storytelling. Over the next few weeks, I accepted the admission, paid my school fees and commenced registration.\n\nIn the course of my study, a number of my school\u2019s staff often advised us \u2013 especially those of us who were offered admission by the school \u2013 to go and print out our original JAMB admission letter, also known as \u201cregularization\u201d if we want to go for the mandatory one year National Youth Service. But, when you\u2019re a freshman studying a four year course, graduation seems to be so far away.\n\nAnd so many of us didn\u2019t do it at the time. This has come to bite us literally and figuratively.\n\nToday, I was supposed to have been mobilized for the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corp, NYSC, but that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nMost of my classmates whom I graduated with have all gone and are serving right now as I speak: some in Batch B Stream 1 and others in Batch B Stream 2.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t I gone is the question I and those close to me, are asking.\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s because I\u2019m yet to have my original JAMB admission letter, but, deep down, there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye.\n\nIs the regularisation real or hoax? If you go to any JAMB office nationwide, they will tell you that they have stopped regularization. But the same JAMB collects the sum of five thousand (N5,000) naira from students for this service.\n\nI first got to know about this through an article on The Nation Newspaper, The University of Jos vs. JAMB, where a JAMB spokesperson referred students with issues of regularization to go back to their school and resolve the issue.\n\nIn his words, \u201cJAMB stopped doing Regularization since 2017\u201d.\n\nI got admission to study film at the National Film Institute, Jos in 2015.\n\nNow, this admission was given by the Institute and I was supposed to go and \u201cregularize\u201d the admission with JAMB.\n\nBeing a newbie, I went several times to JAMB office and several cyber cafe\u2019s around but, I didn\u2019t understand what I was supposed to do.\n\nSeverally, I tried to check my admission status but it wouldn\u2019t go through. It was until I graduated that I understood what I was supposed to do and by this time it came with a warning that unless I did it, I wouldn\u2019t be going for service.\n\nI started doing the Regularization by March 2020 but, before I could pay, Nigeria went on lockdown and with the lockdown, JAMB payment portal was closed.\n\nIt was not until late October 2020 that it was opened and I succeeded in regularizing on November 2nd, 2020.\n\nFrom November 2nd, 2020 up till now, I still haven\u2019t received my original JAMB admission letter.\n\nWhen I asked what was the issue, my school, The National Film Institute, said that it was because JAMB has refused to send the PIN with which the University of Jos (which we are affiliated to) will use in printing it.\n\nBut what is the struggle for printing admission letter really all about? Before 2016, Universities nationwide offer provisional admission to Students\u2019.\n\nIn 2016, JAMB began offering admission to Students and with this every avenue some Universities used to make money like offering admission to some students in exchange for huge sums of money became a thing of the past.\n\nMost University authorities didn\u2019t like this and in 2021, they convinced JAMB to focus on just conducting the exams and leave the admission to them.\n\nThe University of Jos is one of the beneficiaries of this. With access granted to the University of Jos to print the admission letter, I thought my days of sorrow were over.\n\nI have called Paulina Yache, the Institute\u2019s contact person in charge of Regularization severally but, she too ran out of excuses and referred me to a Mr. Bitrus Gofup, in charge of regularization at the University of Jos.\n\nMr. Bitrus Gofup has been a torn in my flesh and in the flesh of other Students with the same issue. On the surface, Mr. Bitrus Gofup, a middle-aged junior staff at the Exams Office of the University appears as a genial and considerate father-figure who is out there to help students but deep down he is as corrupt as they come.\n\nI called him severally and he continued to assure me that my original JAMB admission letter has been sent to JAMB and that very soon it will be out, only for me to go to his office on Thursday October 6th, 2022 to discover that my name was not on the list of students that will be mobilized for service during the Batch C registration. In fact, there was no evidence to suggest that he has worked on my file, nor minuted on it.\n\nThis was after receiving assurances from him that he has sent our names to JAMB and that we should be patient that we will soon have our original JAMB admission letters.\n\nIf he\u2019s lying in order to get us very desperate to bribe him, it wouldn\u2019t be far from the truth. One of our classmates and friend who has the same regularisation problem told me that her friend gave Mr Bitrus Gofup the sum of N10,000 to fast track the process for him. Another classmate of mine, said she gave him the sum of N5000, but up till now both of these students are yet to have their original JAMB admission letters, or gone for service.\n\nWe are tired of all this. I have spoken to several Professors on this matter. I have also spoken to the Rector of my school. I have written to the Acting Vice Chancellor of the University of Jos, Professor Ejikeme, but, have gotten no reply.\n\nRight now, we are at a loss how to move forward. We just want to have this sorted out so that we know if we should go get a job or just run abroad.\n\n________________\n\nOgochukwu Umeadi, writer-designer wrote from Jos.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nuhu Ribadu, a former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commits (EFCC), has blamed most of the country\u2019s challenges on fake news peddled by social media.\n\nMr Ribadu said this on Sunday in Abuja, while reacting to reports in the social media that he accused some top government functionaries of sponsoring banditry in the country.\n\nThe former EFCC boss, who spoke at a news conference, said it was time for him to clear the air on the issue, which he said had been on for some time.\n\n\u201cJuly 2019 was the first time I came out to know about it, and I came out with a very strong denial, saying that it was a fabrication and had no basis.\n\n\u201cIt was a piece of rubbish with very bad grammar and factual destruction but indeed very damaging.\n\n\u201cI reacted very strongly after that, it didn\u2019t stop and I was forced again to issue a statement denying it.\n\n\u201cI thought that would have been the end of it, but not long afterwards, it started coming back again and I am worried and concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ribadu said globally, people who were worried and concerned and wanted to fact-check had been getting in touch with him, adding that he had continued to respond to the issue every single day.\n\n\u201cI want to again deny in the strongest terms and send a message to everybody to disregard the statements, it is not fair, it is not just.\n\n\u201cIt is very sinful for you to create something from nowhere and attribute it to an innocent person who doesn\u2019t know anything about it, I have nothing to do with that message.\n\n\u201cThis is my strongest denial, everybody should please disregard the statement: it is not from me, it is not true,\u201d Mr Ribadu stressed.\n\nMr Ribadu said he had been inundated by messages from friends and associates who wanted to find out if the tweets on the issue were actually from him.\n\nHe, however, said he had made a formal complaint to law enforcement agencies for the records, and possibly for them to go after those responsible for the act.\n\nMr Ribadu said it was the responsibility of the state to take action in such situations.\n\n\u201cSocial media is today, partly responsible for what is going on in our country by trying to promote things that are not true and creating division based on religion and ethnicity among others things.\n\n\u201cThey are not being fair to us, and I think the government has a duty and a responsibility to take action, nobody else can do it.\n\n\u201cAs private citizens, we have limited capacity to take action, the government has to,\u201d Mr Ribadu said.\n\nHe said whoever was responsible for accusing him of such lies, was being very unfair and unjust to him and had hurt him a lot.\n\nHe, therefore, called on owners of social media to do something to protect innocent people from suffering unjustly because of lies told against them on their platforms.\n\nHe added that a combination of government, established media outfits and social media companies could do something to address the situation.\n\n\u201cSocial media companies also have a role to play, I don\u2019t see any reason why Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram\n\nwill allow such a damaging statement to go out against somebody without stopping it.\n\n\u201cEven though I had denied it and so many people in the same situation did, WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter still allowed it to be moved around from one platform to the other.,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ribadu said he did ,however. had great regards for the print media and established television stations which he noted had refused to be part of peddling fake news like most social media.\n\nAccording to him, social media is doing a lot of damage to the people and nation.\n\nHe said that the danger of fake news peddled mostly by social media could not be underestimated, saying that it cost the gynocide in Rwanda, where close to a million people died.\n\nThe former EFCC boss said the same thing happened in Sereleon and Liberia.\n\nHe said that fake news portends very serious danger and could actually harm a country and its people because of it\u2019s very dangerous consequences.\n\nHe said those behind it were doing evil to their people and to their countries, adding that there was no benefit for them.\n\n\u201cI am a believer of freedom of expression, a strong and firm believer in the ability of people to be free, but at the same time, be responsible.\n\n\u201cIf it is going to cause harm to others, then you lose that freedom.\n\n\u201cI am a victim, and I don\u2019t know why people are doing it, it\u2019s as if I am a target of something which I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cBut I have really suffered because of it; I have a couple of friends and colleagues who also went through the same thing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ribadu said it was unfortunate that some persons out of nowhere, would create a lie and innocent people would consume and believe it.\n\nHe noted that a lot of people acted on fake news which had caused them a lot of danger.\n\n(NAN)",

We have only three points on our agenda \u2014 restructuring, restructuring and restructuring.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our Distinct Nationhood Agenda, DNA, is simple, it is RUN \u2014 Restructuring For United Nigeria \u2013 this is what I\u2019m set to advance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running and leading a movement called the New Nigeria Progressives Movement.

Tear it down so that we can build a nation.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that those insisting on the 2023 elections before restructuring, \u201care putting the cart before horse.\u201d\n\nHe warned the President that unless he restructured the country before leaving office, \u201chistory will recall that you failed\u2026\u201d",

          "text": "Marketers of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, otherwise known as cooking gas, have warned that the 12.5kg of cooking gas, which currently sells for about N8, 000 might increase to N10, 000 before December if the current crisis in the sector is not addressed.\n\nThe marketers have expressed concerns over the supply shortage which is rocking the sector and has led to recent series of increases in the price of the commodity.\n\nExecutive Secretary of the National Association of LPG Marketers (NALPGAM), Mr Bassey Essien, gave the warning during the weekly e-discourse organised by a leading Pan-African forum, Platforms Africa, according to a statement on Saturday by the organisation\u2019s Team Lead, Adeola Yusuf, according to Punch.\n\nEssien noted that the Federal Government needed to review the recently introduced import charges and Value Added Tax or else, the price of cooking gas may as well get to N10, 000 for a 12.5kg cylinder.\n\n\u201cToday (Saturday), the price has risen to N7, 500 and N8, 000. The skyrocketing price of gas is our fear and what we are trying to avoid. Early in the year a 20-metric ton of gas was selling for below N5m but today, the same tonnage sells for N10.2m. As long as there is that supply shortage, the available quantity and the dynamics of supply-demand will keep pushing the price higher,\u201d he said.\n\nLamenting poor patronage of NALPGAM by customers due to the high price, Essien said the association was concerned that more Nigerians were being forced to return to coal, sawdust, kerosene, and other dirty fuel as \u201cthe price of the cooking gas has suddenly gone up.\u201d\n\nThe NALPGAM Secretary said despite the current challenges, the association was discussing with the government, stakeholders, producers and importers to see how the situation could be addressed in addition to trying to persuade marketers not to take advantage of the crisis to inflict more pains on citizens by increasing the cost of gas in their locations though they are equally expending huge cost to have cooking gas at their locations.\n\nNALPGAM secretary also expressed worry over the gradual rise in the cost of cylinders over the years, maintaining that all the raw materials used by the two cylinder manufacturing plants in the country were imported.\n\nHe said despite Nigeria\u2019s over 180 million population, the country barely had up to 10 million cylinders in circulation amid substandard cylinders in circulation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe cylinder ownership structure in the country ensures that owners are in charge of their cylinders. Cylinders expire on the 15th year of usage from the manufacturing date. Because of the high replacement cost, consumers buy what they can afford. This has equally encouraged the proliferation of substandard cylinders in circulation. The regulators are working hard to monitor the standard of cylinders coming into the country.\n\n\u201cThe progress in cylinder acquisition still needs government input to ensure that the cost of materials for cylinder production get the necessary exemption from duties but however the state of our local currency still remains a major problem.\u201d",

Out of N160.5bn, N22.7bn was allotted to personnel cost, while overhead got N679.7m. About N137.2 will be expended on capital projects across the country.\n\nHowever, the ministry\u2019s headquarters got N85.2bn, out of which N938.179.428m will be spent on salaries and travel allowances of staff.\n\nStaff salaries will gulp N898.1m while N40.1m will be spent on local and international travels by officials of the ministry.\n\nLocal travel and training got N17.8m, others got N17.5m, while international travels got N4.7m.\n\nAbuja second runway gets additional N20bn\n\nThe federal government is to expend additional N20bn on the ongoing second runway of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja in 2022.\n\nThe second runway, which is estimated to gulp N67bn, has been largely stalled due to poor funding.\n\nIt would be recalled that in the 2017 budget, N10bn was voted for the project, N8bn in 2018, N13bn in 2019 and N14bn in 2021.\n\nThe federal government also set aside N1.6bn to refund Bayelsa and Kebbi governments for the construction of airports at their respective states.\n\nAlso contained in the budget of the Ministry of Finance is N1bn for the installation of Category Three (CAT3) Instrument Landing System (ILS) and airfield lighting in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Katsina, Kano and other airports.\n\nEducation gets below UNESCO target\n\nThe federal government has voted N1.290tn for the education sector in the 2022 appropriation bill against the allotted N742bn in the 2021 budgetary allocation.\n\nThe N1.290tn for education is 7.9 per cent of the N16.3tn and the third highest allocation for the year 2022, and yet, failed to meet the minimum of 15 to 20 per cent for developing countries\u2019 as suggested by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).\n\nHealth gets increased budgeting\n\nThe allocation to health for next year at N711.285b is about 30 per cent higher than N549.82b in the current year.\n\nThe emphasis on this sector is hardly surprising after the devastation the sector experienced during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nPresident Buhari said some of the activities that would be undertaken in this sector in 2022 included \u201ccritical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading primary health care centres across the six geopolitical zones.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\n\u2026Ex-Governor: \u2018I Returned Hale, Hearty And Well\u2019\n\nNational Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has taken his first outing since his return from the United Kingdom (UK) last Friday night.\n\nTinubu, on Sunday, reunited with his political associates and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at a welcome-back event and prayer hosted by Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, at the State House in Marina.\n\nAt 2:45pm, the former Lagos State Governor was received by Sanwo-Olu in company of his Deputy, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, and Chief of Staff, Mr. Tayo Ayinde.\n\nThe simple event was attended by all elected office holders and political appointees in Lagos, including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, and Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa.\n\nMembers of the State Executive Council, Governor\u2019s Advisory Council (GAC) and council chairmen were also in attendance.\n\nSanwo-Olu said Tinubu\u2019s return was more than cheery news for his supporters across the country, noting that the APC leader had been rejuvenated with renewed vigour for his next political move.\n\nThe Governor said: \u201cWe have countless reasons to be grateful to God for bringing Asiwaju back home, fully rejuvenated. Since Friday when our leader and father came back, it has been a joyful moment for the teeming residents of Lagos, his supporters and Nigerians across the country. We give glory to God who brought you (Tinubu) back with sound health and stronger vigour.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of all political office holders, party leaders and faithful, we welcome our leader back and we give praises to God on his behalf that the intention of evil-minded people who spread malicious rumour against our leader did not materialise. This event shows Asiwaju is healthy and possesses more energy to embark on his next move in politics.\u201d\n\nTinubu, clad in dark grey kaftan and blue cap to match, said he was highly elated to return after his three-month absence from the country.\n\nThe APC National Leader said the prayer event was an emotional one for him, saying he was overwhelmed by good wishes from Nigerians while he was away. He said took all prayers as valuable compliments.\n\nTinubu said: \u201cI\u2019m a little emotional now but I\u2019m happy. God is the giver of life and the only one who can take life. And he (God) says, if I grant you power and the privilege in this life; I am the only one who can take it from you if you don\u2019t use it in the way and manner that promotes humanity. God can give power to anyone he wills.\n\n\u201cIt is the same God that has spared us till today and has given us the privilege. I give glory to God, because I\u2019m standing before you hale, hearty and well. Today is a day of joy for me, having fixed today for this great event. We are here giving praises to God. May God bless all of you in attendance. I am grateful. I cannot say more than that today. Thank you all.\u201d\n\nDr. Hamzat said Tinubu\u2019s return deepened his associates\u2019 belief in God, stressing that the APC National Leader\u2019s full recovery from the knee surgery was a sign of strength and favour from God.\n\n\u201cNow that Asiwaju is back, we are ready for work. The work has started and we are committed to doing it,\u201d the Deputy Governor said.\n\nGbajabiamila, who spoke on behalf of the National Assembly members, described Tinubu as \u201can eagle\u201d, who is focused and always ahead of the game.\n\nThe Speaker wondered why a \u201csimple knee surgery\u201d became a national issue, but the solidarity shown towards Tinubu across ethnic divides indicated the APC National Leader is an enigma.\n\nObasa called Tinubu a teacher and benefactor, saying his return had put malicious rumour against him to rest.\n\nChairman of Conference 57, who spoke on behalf of the council chairmen, said members of the Conference were ready to join Tinubu in his next political move.\n\nOthers who spoke glowingly about the APC National Leader included the lawmaker representing Lagos West in the Senate, Sen. Olamilekan Adeola, and GAC chairman, Prince Tajudeen Olusi.\n\nPrayers were offered for Tinubu by Muslim and Christian clerics, while party leaders at the event took turns to welcome him back to the fold.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Fiery preacher and founder, The Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare on Sunday said President Muhammadu Buhari will become a failed president if he refused to tear down the 1999 constitution before leaving office.\n\nBakare spoke while delivering the State of the Nation address at his Church on Oregun Way, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nHe urged Buhari to stop passing the buck to the National Assembly in giving the nation a brand new constitution before leaving office in 2023.\n\n\u201cI say to President Muhammadu Buhari: Mr President, stop passing the buck to the National Assembly. Tear down this inhibiting concoction of a constitution; tear it down so we can build a truly great nation! This is one enduring legacy your administration can still secure before your time in power draws to a close.\n\n\u201cIf you do, present and unborn generations of Nigerians will remember you for it and write your name in gold when the history of\n\nthis period is written. If you don\u2019t, history will record that you failed to rise to the occasion and squandered a great opportunity.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a geo-political structure that will provide an enabling environment for every zone in our nation to maximize its geo-economic opportunities and potentials under a strong and united Nigeria. This can be achieved by a pragmatic approach to restructuring Nigeria, rather than by mere zoning of the presidency,\u201d he said.\n\nBakare stated that those clamouring and waiting for genuine change to happen through the upcoming 2023 presidential election, without first insisting that the imposed sham of a constitution must be torn and discarded, were merely putting the cart before the horse.\n\nHe said this was nothing but a prescription for retrogression, arguing that no tangible progress could ever be made by such an exercise in futility.\n\nBakare added that it would be tantamount to building a superstructure on a faulty or shaky foundation, saying that as patriots, they have presented to the current government pragmatic pathways to such a geo-economic, geo-social and geo-political restructuring of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, given the lack of political will on the part of the government, the time has come for Nigerian citizens to make informed and compelling demands on the political system. The purpose of this address is to equip the citizens with the tools to do this,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has called for an independent investigation into who is to blame for the alleged killing of two soldiers, as well as the invasion by armed military personnel and subsequent burning down of the palace of the traditional ruler of Izombe community in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo.\n\nHURIWA stated that it is illegal for the military to use extralegal executions of citizens, regardless of the level of perceived offence, and that it has come to light that the killing of a young man by soldiers prompted the revenge killing of two soldiers, which is barbaric and illegal in and of itself.\n\nThe rights group is urging the Imo State Government to establish an independent judicial commission of inquiry to identify the arsonists among the soldiers who petrol-bombed the traditional ruler\u2019s palace, as well as justice and closure for all those killed, including the two soldiers allegedly set ablaze by some enraged youths.\n\nThe group expressed concern that the Nigerian military has yet to grasp that, under constitutional democracy, no institution has the legal authority to take the law into its own hands, regardless of provocation or anger, just as setting fire to the traditional ruler\u2019s housing assets has been described as an act of primitive brutality and an uncivilized modus operandi that must be dealt with swiftly and decisively.\n\nMr James Imo, a community leader from Umuokwu village, told HURIWA that around 50 houses had been burned down.\n\nIt criticized what it called the enraged adolescents\u2019 callous behavior in reportedly murdering the uniformed personnel, saying that the cruel criminal crime of killing law enforcement officers is despicable and reprehensible.\n\nHURIWA insisted that what is legal is for the Nigerian Army to report to the police, who will immediately go into action and arrest the suspected killers of the two soldiers so that they can be prosecuted for murders, rather than for the soldiers to take self-help measures such as invading communities, burning down houses, and shooting at anything that moves in order to avenge the alleged brutal killing of two of their colleagues.\n\nThe association urged Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, the Chief of Army Staff, to accelerate his announced program of professionalisation of the armed forces and devise ways to ensure that soldiers do not resort to self-help measures in the future, such as invading a community where one of their members is killed in the line of duty or even committing an atrocious act of extrajudicial execution of a citizen.\n\nAccording to the rights group, the medieval trend of invasion and arson by enraged soldiers is completely unlawful and tantamount to terrorism.\n\nHURIWA also asked the Inspector General of Police, Alhaji Usman Alkali Baba, to look into a damaging allegation that police officers in Nsukka, Enugu State, invaded a traditional ruler\u2019s home, destroyed the property, maimed visitors, manhandled the traditional ruler, and then abducted him to an unknown location over an alleged land-related dispute the traditional ruler had with another community resident.\n\nAccording to reports, HRH, Igwe, Christopher Okwor, the traditional ruler of Ihekwuenu autonomous community in Aku, Igbo-Etiti Local Government Area of Enugu State, was allegedly beaten and hauled to an unknown location by persons presumed to be policemen on Thursday.\n\nMartina Okwor, the traditional ruler\u2019s wife, who was also allegedly beaten by officers who invaded the traditional ruler\u2019s home in Umakashi, Nsukka, said the incident happened around 10 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nHURIWA said, \u201cWe hereby appealed to the Chief of Police of Nigeria to investigate the circumstances surrounding these disgraceful and criminal allegations against his men and officers and to arrest, investigate and charge any of his operatives indicted for participating in this illicit raid of the home of a citizen and reportedly destroyed the housing assets in a crude attempt to harass, intimidate and ambush a citizen on the strength of a so-called petition filed by another citizen especially bordering on land-related disputes.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Police Force must begin the period of sanitisation and clean up of the vestiges of professional misconducts and all tendencies that had brought bad publicity and global opprobrium on the institution such as this type of illegal orchestration and misuse of power by the police\u201d.",

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

We continue to face security threats and violent crimes such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping and politically motivated killings which threaten our national integration,\u201d he said, according to a statement signed by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu.\n\n\u201cI assure you that this administration will continue to do everything within the ambit of the law to eliminate all forms of violent crimes that are creating fear and anxiety among the citizenry.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state in this regard that, we have received new equipment in our fight against any form of insecurity from our friendly countries.\n\n\u201cThese assets will be deployed to accelerate the fight against insecurity in all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that security had assumed priority in governance and public policy in international scheme of affairs.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that we introduced a new Landing Ship Tank early this year to replace the first set of naval ship tanks which were decommissioned by the Nigerian Navy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the Landing Ship Tank is expected to bolster the Navy\u2019s Sealift capability and promote our global maritime commerce, peace and safety within the Gulf of Guinea and our maritime neighbourhood.\u201d\n\nThe President said the administration was poised to eliminate the incentives for corruption by addressing some of the remote causes as part of a long-term strategy for a more effective and sustained war on the practice.\n\nHe said improvement of livelihoods of citizens had been going on in partnership with relevant organized private sector.\n\nAccording to him, some of the interventions by government are: \u201cA smart law enforcement; provision of improved access to education that prepares our youths for global competitiveness; provision of quality health services for improved life expectancy and decent and affordable housing, among others.\n\n\u201cIt is the conviction of this administration that ineffective policies for social provisioning must be redressed in our efforts to tackle the fundamental causes of corruption in our society. This is how best to give vent to the much-cherished values of fairness, equity and justice to the people of this nation.\n\n\u201cI must also emphasize here that, for us to achieve a peaceful, prosperous and democratic country that will attract foreign investors we must be law abiding, committed and promoters of peaceful co-existence. This is a collective responsibility which will definitely yield the Nigeria of our dreams.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari commended the Commandant of the NDA, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Manu Yusuf, for the infrastructural upgrade in the military institution, and the colourful parade by the cadets of 68 regular course.\n\n\u201cIt gladdens my heart to see the level of infrastructural development in the Academy. It is a clear testament to the vision, dedication and excellence in the best tradition of NDA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNigerians acknowledge that the Academy has consistently justified its existence over the years by turning out well trained and disciplined officers for the Armed Forces of Nigeria as well as militaries of allied nations.\n\n\u201cThe NDA has over the years trained and graduated military and paramilitary personnel as well as interested civilians seeking postgraduate education. It is therefore not surprising that the Academy has earned a reputation as an outstanding military Academy in Africa. Let me therefore extend my sincere felicitation to the Commandant, staff and gentlemen cadets of the Academy on this memorable occasion.\u201d\n\nThe President, who was the Reviewing Officer, told Graduating Officer Cadets, that the world they were entering was very different from that which confronted many of their predecessors.\n\n\u201cThe contemporary security environment has been described as violent, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.\n\n\u201cYou can therefore expect that the missions that you will be tasked to undertake will be similarly complex. Beyond these significant rationales, I am convinced that we have a real stake, and an abiding self-interest, in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where school children are not kidnapped and where individuals are not slaughtered because of their tribe, faith or political beliefs.\u201d",

They are also fractious and quarrelsome and lacking even enlightened self-interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to the professor of Political Science, there is a need to create a special vehicle that can go into alliance and work together to free the country from the stranglehold of parochial and reckless politicians.\n\nREAD ALSO\n\nPDP NEC Approves Zoning Of National Chairmanship Position To The North\n\n2023: Zoning Is Not The Solution To Nigeria\u2019s Problems, Says Atiku\n\n\u2018The Major Hindrance\u2019\n\nJega also dismissed speculations in some quarters that he was joining the 2023 presidential race, noting that his mission was to contribute to positive change in politics.\n\nWhile stating that he is a registered member of the People\u2019s Redemption Party (PRP), Jega noted that he hasn\u2019t told anyone he is interested in running for the position.\n\nThe ex-INEC Chairman also reacted to moves for the electronic transmission of results in general elections, criticising the National Assembly for downplaying its importance.\n\nHe said the constitutional provision that prohibits the use of technology is a hindrance to electronic voting, asking the lawmakers to remove the legal encumbrance for electronic voting to be possible in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn fact, INEC has used it in some elections in parts of the country.

          "text": "Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, have raided, destroyed, and confiscated different illicit drugs from the hideouts of 110 drug traffickers in nine states throughout the nation in the past week.\n\nThis is according a statement released by the Director, Media & Advocacy, Femi Babafemi on Sunday.\n\nAt least 16 individuals were arrested in Lagos on Thursday after police raided known drug joints in Maza Maza, Alakija, Festac town, Amuwo Odofin, Oluti, Isheri roundabout, and Igando.\n\nThe suspects include: Lucky Elibe; Abdullahi Jabir; Amos Kalli; Nweke ThankGod; Tukwosi Arowolu; Odinaka Oramu; Jeremiah Ishaya; Maxwell John; Usman Garba; Christian Okibe; Mba Peter; Sarah Offiri; Wasiu Adeniji; Bode Olaitan; Yetunde Ahmed; and Abdullahi Jibril.\n\nSeven others were equally arrested in different locations in Lekki area of the state. They are: Emmanuel Sunday; Buhari Ibrahim; Kudus Taiwa; Samuel Jeremiah; Adebayo Adams; Joshua Madube and Mary Jane Nweke. While one Okoropo Mathew was arrested in Obalende area of the state\n\nFour others, Sulaiman Hammadu; Olalekan Abiodun; Lukman Kamarudeen and Toyeeb Isa were nabbed in Agege area of Lagos.\n\nA total of 17 suspects were also sent to the Agency for further investigation after being apprehended by troops from the 149 Battalion (Rear), Nigerian Army Cantonment, Ojo. Cocaine, Heroin, Tramadol, Methamphetamine, Diazepam, Cannabis, and other psychotropic drugs were seized from the suspects.\n\nThe arrest of a 19-year-old female drug dealer, Mngunengen Achir, with 5.5kg Cannabis and 112grams of Diazepam in the Aliade area of Benue on Wednesday 6th October took a disturbing turn when other members of her cartel abducted a retired NDLEA personnel from that community who they assumed was still a serving officer, took him to a forest, and demanded the release of the suspect in custody before their victim would be freed.\n\nIn Nasarawa, a raid on the home of a drug lord in the Ruga area of Mararaba, Karu LGA, resulted in the recovery of 30 bags of cannabis weighing 362.5kg, while in Akwa Ibom state, three male suspects were arrested on Wednesday 6th October during a raid on drug joints in the Oron area, resulting in the seizure of over 25 kilograms of drugs.\n\nIn Ondo, a notorious drug dealer at Ogbani-Oja Okitipupa, Okitipupa LGA, Adedugba Adeyemi, a.k.a Oyinbo, was arrested in his fortified den, where different quantities of Cocaine, Heroin and Skunk were recovered. Seven other suspects were arrested in some drug joints in other parts of the state, including Shasha market, Akure North LG; Asolo camp, Usho, Owo LG; Albert Link Street, Finger Licking hotel and Shittu street, all in Akure, the state capital.\n\nIn Kano, one Shamsuddeen Muhammad was arrested with 21.6kg cannabis, well concealed inside empty cartons, while in Oyo state, no fewer than 12 persons were arrested at drug joints raided and dismantled across the state. Some of the destroyed black spots include: Alfa area, Sabo motor park, Idisin Ijeru area, Odo Oba, Gambari in Oyo area; Igboro joint in Saki town, Agberele forest joint in Saki west LG; Ago Are market in Atisbo LG; Eleyele motorpark, Eleyele forest, Apete complex, Sabo garage, Ojoo, all in Ibadan as well as Odo Oba, Ogo Oluwa LGA.\n\nIn Kwara, no fewer than 38 suspects were arrested and 29.585kg assorted drugs including Cocaine, Meth, Tramadol, Diazepam and others recovered from them across seven drug joints in Lafiagi. In Rivers, at least three persons were arrested from drug joints in Oyigbo and Kara oil mill area of the state on Saturday 9th October.\n\nIn a related development, narcotic officers from the Agency\u2019s Directorate of Operation and General Investigations, DOGI, intercepted more than 5 kilograms of methamphetamine and cannabis hidden in the soles of ladies shoes, body cream, and auto spare parts bound for Australia, Pakistan, South Korea, and Hong Kong in four courier firms in Lagos.\n\nBrig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, commended the officers and men of the nine state Commands for bringing the fight to the drug cartels\u2019 doorsteps within communities and in the forests. Their contributions to rescuing the lives of innocent children, women, and adults from the merchants of death, he added, will be remembered forever. He urged them, as well as their colleagues in other commands, to stay tenacious in their fight against the narco-syndicates.",

The increase(d) rate of fire incidences involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and properties of our members and general public is enough. This is because of government failure to enforce installation of safety gadget on tanker. This will protect the inflammation contents of their trucks from spilling over in a situation of road accident.\n\n\u201cWe see the failure of the government in this regards as height of insensitivity to lives of innocent Nigerians and union cannot continue to hold its hands while our members are getting burnt everywhere and everyday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe zonal chairman stated that the union is dissatisfied with the unethical usage of tonnage.\n\n\u201cThere are some trucks that carry 60,000 litres to 100,000 litres on the highway. This load has a negative effect and impact on the safety and control of drivers on the wheel as well as durability and sustainability of the highway. The unions do not want any truck to carry more than the approved capacity,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Aboyeji said the union had given notice to the government \u201cto put all these in order to avert the nationwide strike on Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that the present administration would not do anything until we start the nationwide strike,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Facebook Unveils New Controls for Kids Using Its Platforms",
          "text": "Facebook, in the aftermath of damning testimony that its platforms harm children, will be introducing several features including prompting teens to take a break using its photo sharing app Instagram, and \u201cnudging\u201d teens if they are repeatedly looking at the same content that\u2019s not conducive to their well-being.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based Facebook is also planning to introduce new controls for adults of teens on an optional basis so that parents or guardians can supervise what their teens are doing online. These initiatives come after Facebook announced late last month that it was pausing work on its Instagram for Kids project. But critics say the plan lacks details and they are skeptical that the new features would be effective.\n\nThe new controls were outlined on Sunday by Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global affairs, who made the rounds on various Sunday news shows including CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos\u201d where he was grilled about Facebook\u2019s use of algorithms as well as its role in spreading harmful misinformation ahead of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly iterating in order to improve our products,\u201d Clegg told Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cWe cannot, with a wave of the wand, make everyone\u2019s life perfect. What we can do is improve our products, so that our products are as safe and as enjoyable to use.\u201d\n\nClegg said that Facebook has invested $13 billion over the past few years in making sure to keep the platform safe and that the company has 40,000 people working on these issues.\n\nThe flurry of interviews came after whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former data scientist with Facebook, went before Congress last week to accuse the social media platform of failing to make changes to Instagram after internal research showed apparent harm to some teens and of being dishonest in its public fight against hate and misinformation. Haugen\u2019s accusations were supported by tens of thousands of pages of internal research documents she secretly copied before leaving her job in the company\u2019s civic integrity unit.\n\nJosh Golin, executive director of Fairplay, a watchdog for the children and media marketing industry, said that he doesn\u2019t think introducing controls to help parents supervise teens would be effective since many teens set up secret accounts any way. He was also dubious about how effective nudging teens to take a break or move away from harmful content would be. He noted Facebook needs to show exactly how they would implement it and offer research that shows these tools are effective.\n\n\u201cThere is tremendous reason to be skeptical,\u201d he said. He added that regulators need to restrict what Facebook does with its algorithms.\n\nHe said he also believes that Facebook should cancel its Instagram project for kids.\n\nWhen Clegg was grilled by both Bash and Stephanopoulos in separate interviews about the use of algorithms in amplifying misinformation ahead of Jan. 6 riots, he responded that if Facebook removed the algorithms people would see more, not less hate speech, and more, not less, misinformation.\n\nClegg told both hosts that the algorithms serve as \u201cgiant spam filters.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, told Bash in a separate interview Sunday that it\u2019s time to update children\u2019s privacy laws and offer more transparency in the use of algorithms.\n\n\u201cI appreciate that he is willing to talk about things, but I believe the time for conversation is done,\u201d said Klobuchar, referring to Clegg\u2019s plan. \u201cThe time for action is now.\u201d",

          "text": "The US has agreed to provide humanitarian aid to a desperately poor Afghanistan on the brink of an economic disaster, while refusing to give political recognition to the country\u2019s new Taliban rulers, the Taliban said Sunday.\n\nThe statement came at the end of the first direct talks between the former foes since the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of August.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the U.S. on the weekend meeting.\n\nThe Taliban said the talks held in Doha, Qatar, \u201cwent well,\u201d with Washington freeing up humanitarian aid to Afghanistan after agreeing not to link such assistance to formal recognition of the Taliban.\n\nThe United States made it clear that the talks were in no way a preamble to recognition of the Taliban, who swept into power Aug. 15 after the U.S.-allied government collapsed.\n\nTaliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen also told The Associated Press that the movement\u2019s interim foreign minister assured the U.S. during the talks that the Taliban are committed to seeing that Afghan soil is not used by extremists to launch attacks against other countries.\n\nOn Saturday, however, the Taliban ruled out cooperation with Washington on containing the increasingly active Islamic State group in Afghanistan.\n\nIS, an enemy of the Taliban, has claimed responsibility for a number of recent attacks, including Friday\u2019s suicide bombing that killed 46 minority Shiite Muslims. Washington considers IS its greatest terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe are able to tackle Daesh independently,\u201d Shaheen said when asked whether the Taliban would work with the U.S. to contain the Islamic State affiliate. He used an Arabic acronym for IS.\n\nBill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who tracks militant groups, agreed the Taliban do not need Washington\u2019s help to hunt down and destroy Afghanistan\u2019s IS affiliate, known as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province, or ISKP.\n\nThe Taliban \u201cfought 20 years to eject the U.S., and the last thing it needs is the return of the U.S. It also doesn\u2019t need U.S. help,\u201d said Roggio, who also produces the foundation\u2019s Long War Journal. \u201cThe Taliban has to conduct the difficult and time-consuming task of rooting out ISKP cells and its limited infrastructure. It has all the knowledge and tools it needs to do it.\u201d\n\nThe IS affiliate doesn\u2019t have the advantage of safe havens in Pakistan and Iran that the Taliban had in its fight against the United States, Roggio said. However, he warned that the Taliban\u2019s longtime support for al-Qaida make them unreliable as counterterrorism partners with the United States.\n\nThe Taliban gave refuge to al-Qaida before it carried out the 9/11 attacks. That prompted the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan that drove the Taliban from power.\n\n\u201cIt is insane for the U.S. to think the Taliban can be a reliable counterterrorism partner, given the Taliban\u2019s enduring support for al-Qaida,\u201d Roggio said.\n\nDuring the meeting, U.S. officials were expected to press the Taliban to allow Americans and others to leave Afghanistan. In their statement, the Taliban said without elaborating that they would \u201cfacilitate principled movement of foreign nationals.\u201d",

Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd) commended the officers and men of the nine state Commands for taking the battle to the doorsteps of the drug cartels within the communities and in the forests.\n\nHe said their contributions towards saving the lives of innocent youths; women and adults from the merchants of death would never be forgotten, while charging them and their colleagues in other commands to remain resilient as they continue with the offensive action against the narco-syndicates.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
