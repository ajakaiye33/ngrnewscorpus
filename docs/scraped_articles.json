          "text": "PRESIDENT of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has defended Nigeria\u2019s borrowing spree, arguing that the Federal Government cannot tax Nigerians any further to fund infrastructure.\n\nLawan also said that Nigeria was currently poor and had no other option but to borrow to finance infrastructure.\n\nHe, however, affirmed that the legislature would not be frivolous in granting Executive\u2019s requests for loans.\n\nThe Senate President said these on Thursday in an interview with State House correspondents after meeting with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nLawan asserted that requests for loans would pass through thorough scrutiny to ensure they were necessary, adding that when permitted, the loans would be monitored to ensure effective use.\n\nHe said the National Assembly would deliberate on other equally important matters such as the President\u2019s request for loans before vacating for the summer.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe\u2019ll also have the loan request from Mr. President. The loan request is to fund the 2021 Appropriation Act and of course, this is not a new request. It\u2019s something that we have passed in the MTEF and it\u2019s something that when we pass the budget 2021, we also passed that.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the executive arm of government. Our options are really very limited as a country. First, we don\u2019t have the necessary revenues, Nigeria is poor; we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves.\n\n\u201cYou cannot, in my view and judgement, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructure development. Other countries do that, but we have serious situations across the country; so, you cannot put taxes on people.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEF insist on restructuring ahead talks with ACF",
          "text": "Two major socio-political groups in the North-Central, the Middle Belt Forum and the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, have dissociated themselves from the pan-northern association, the Arewa Consultative Forum.\n\nThe MBF and SOKAPU, in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Thursday, said although they were not opposed to the ACF\u2019s planned meeting with southern groups, they were not part of the Arewa forum.\n\nThe organisations stated this as southern groups said the need to restructure the country would be raised at the meeting.\n\nThe ACF, at its national executive council meeting in Kaduna on Wednesday, said it hoped to meet leaders of the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere and the Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo over rising insecurity in the country and other issues.\n\nBut the Spokesman for the Middle Belt Forum, Dr Isuwa Dogo, in an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday, said the group would not attend the meeting as part of the ACF.\n\nDogo said, \u201cThe Middle Belt Forum does not attend meetings with the ACF or any other group except with Ohaneze Ndigbo, Afenifere and PANDEF (Pan-Niger Delta Forum). The four groups are together. So, if the ACF is meeting with those groups in the South , it also includes Middle Belt Forum.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for the agenda they have and we will respond appropriately when the agenda is made known to us.\u201d\n\nDogo, who insisted that the people of Middle Belt had their cultural identity distinct from that of the ACF, said, \u201cOne thing you should know is that we are not part of whatever the ACF is doing .We have our own identity which is different from theirs.\u201d\n\nACF pursuing Hausa/Fulani interest, agenda in opposite direction with ours \u2013 SOKAPU\n\nAlso, SOKAPU said it was not part of the ACF. It said the reason it would attend the meeting would be because its allies would be in attendance.\n\nAccording to the Spokesman for SOKAPU, Luka Binniyat, the ACF cannot speak for the people of southern Kaduna.\n\nHe added that the ACF was pursuing the agenda of the Hausa-Fulani people.\n\nBinniyat said, \u201cSOKAPU is not an appendage of the ACF. But if we will attend, it will be because the Middle Belt Forum, which is our mother body, will be attending. And it will also be that because our allies, PANDF, Afinefere and Ohaneze will be in attendance.\n\n\u201cThe ACF is a select, privileged group of elites from the former Northern Region which is now 19 states. They have arrogated to themselves the role of speaking for the region.\n\n\u201cIt has been led 98 per cent of the time by core Hausa/Fulani Muslims of the core north with a sprinkling of Middle Belters given curious roles over time. The ACF does not care about the plight of the people of Southern Kaduna and indeed for the Middle Belt.\n\n\u201cIt is not known to stand for us in the midst of the unrelenting violence visited on us by armed herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThat Audu Ogbe, an Idoma man, from the Middle Belt is its current chairman, is nothing but a ruse.\n\n\u201cIt is deception to lure the Middle Belt and other parts of the country into thinking that the ACF is such an all inclusive forum, but we know the puppeteer.\n\n\u201cThe ACF cannot speak for SOKAPU. It has never demonstrated any solidarity with our people. It\u2019s hugely out to pursue the agenda of the Hausa/Fulani, which, in most cases, is in opposite directions with our own interest in SOKAPU.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what they want to discuss at the meeting. We have not seen the agenda of the meeting.\n\n\u201cBut if SOKAPU will attend, our interest will be first and foremost the security and safety of our area. We shall table the issues of our captured 108 territories and the thousands of internally displaced persons from these areas.\n\n\u201cThe issue of restructuring of Nigeria is also on top of our demands. The unjust treatment of our people and unfair infrastructure and project allotment; political appointments, destruction of our traditional institution and irrational demolition of homes and property of our people will also form our agenda.\u201d\n\nRestructuring, key to meeting with ACF \u2013 PANDEF\n\nPANDEF said restructuring was key and fundamental to any meaningful discussion aimed at moving Nigeria forward.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson said this to one of our correspondents on the phone.\n\nRobinson said PANDEF was ready for a sincere meeting with ACF, pointing out that the restructuring of Nigeria was the forerunner to a myriad of issues.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe fundamental issue is restructuring. It is the structure of the country that has given birth to all the other others issues primarily. Even the economic issues, security issues\n\n\u201cPeople are aggrieved because of the uneven distribution of oil resources particular for us in the South-South. We produce about 80 to 85 per cent of the resources and we get less than 20 per cent.\n\n\u201cOur places not developed. Our people are suffering. Livelihoods have been devastated. Our environments have been degraded. Those are the issues.\n\n\u201cFor some other parts of the country, the issues of killer herdsmen and all that. They are all issues related to how the country is being run.\n\n\u201cSo, restructuring is the ABC and to Z of Nigeria\u2019s problems. If we restructure the faulty way leaders emerge, the arrogance of elected officials, the lack of regard of the citizens will end.\n\n\u201cSo, the restructuring is wholistic and not just about derivation. It is not about devolution. It is about electoral reforms.\n\n\u201cWell, if they are serious and sincere and we seat with them to talk, because every issue is settled on a round table where there is mutual respect and understanding. And all that we have been asking for is a national consensus. Let us agree that things are not working.\n\n\u201cWe have been operating a system for about 60 years and the country has not made much progress. And we cannot continue in this manner. That is the fact.\n\n\u201cSo, if they have come to the realisation that maybe what these people are saying is real, of course they know it is real but because of the benefits they get from the faulty, flawed, military imposed dictatorial constitution, they don\u2019t want changes.\u201d Everything is skew in their favour, including the membership of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze lists four issues\n\nOn its part, Ohanaeze Ndigbo listed four major issues it would discuss with the ACF.\n\nAccording to the group, the four issues are restructuring, 2023 presidency, inclusion of Igbo in appointment of security chiefs and reciprocity of Igbo hospitality in their domains.\n\nSpokesperson for Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, who spoke with one of our correspondents on the telephone, maintained that Ohanaeze position was well-defined, adding \u201cif you ask any Nigerian what is Ohanaeze\u2019s position, he will always tell you. We have never missed words.\n\nOgbonnia however, said \u201cIt can be classified into four major broad areas: one, presidency 2023 as a matter of equity and fairness. In 2023, presidency should go to the Igbo.\n\n\u201cTwo, the whole Southern governors including Ohanaeze have agreed on structuring Nigeria. The essence of restructuring is to see how we can unlock the potential of the teaming young Nigerians. On the other hand if Nigeria is restructured it will give vent to various hunt of talents. It will help unleash talents among the all segments of Nigerians. That is, it will be an opportunity available to us to explore the mineral resources within our reach and also to help expand the economic base of the people of Nigeria. Above all, it will reduce tension at the centre, because the more Nigeria is restructured the less the tension at the centre. It is to the advantage of everybody.\n\n\u201cThird, in the current dispensation, the Igbo have been complaining that of all the entire security architecture of Nigeria, no person from the South-East is found worthy. It is not good and we are going to discuss it.\n\n\u201cFourth, Do unto others as they do unto you. The Igbo wherever we are are very hospitable. When other people come to South-East, we are very hospitable.\u201d\n\nMeeting of ACF will give room for national development discussion \u2013 Afenifere\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of the Afenifere, Mr Sola Ebiseni, in an interview with The PUNCH, said the meeting would give room for discussions that would pertain to the development of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have only read about the proposed meeting in the media, like most other Nigerians and would not like to speculate on the agenda. We believe in dialogue among stakeholders for the progress and development of Nigeria. For instance, the Jonathan administration brought together the various groups, including representatives of all ethnic nationalities in the 2014 National Conference and we all came up with resolutions to move Nigeria forward.\n\n\u201cThe high point of that conference was that all the resolutions were arrived at by consensus. Since then, there have been pressures on government for the implementation of the report of the conference. The Afenifere, Ohaneze, PANDEF and the Middle Belt Forum (Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum) have several times met, formed synergy and resolved unanimously on moving the country forward, using the conference report as minimum template for restructuring the Nigerian political architecture.\n\n\u201cThe initiative of the Arewa Consultative Forum joining the rest of us mentioned is a welcome development.\u201d ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He maintained that his government is focused on promoting a business-friendly environment to make the country more attractive and an investors\u2019 destination.\n\nIn his response, Dangote thanked President Biya and the people of Cameroon for the great honour done to him in the award of the nation\u2019s highest civilian honour.\n\nHe disclosed that there are plans to diversify the group\u2019s investments in Cameroon, starting with energy. He said, \u201cWe have plans to expand our investment to other sectors beginning with oil and gas while our capacity in cement will be expanded\u201d.\n\nHe commended the Cameroonian government for providing an enabling environment, which aided the successful completion of the Dangote Cement plant. He also expressed appreciation for the support provided by the President and cabinet in solving the challenges encountered in the construction of the plant.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the inception of our construction activities at the plant, we encountered several challenges, but the government stepped in and ensured that we overcame these initial problems.\n\n\u201cAlso, the incentives by the Government to investors are encouraging. We feel very much at home here in Cameroon because of the business-friendly environment. If demand for cement increases, we will increase the capacity of the plant and make the country self-sufficient in cement production.\u201d\n\nDangote Cement Cameroon SA, part of Dangote Cement Group was commissioned six years ago, and has boosted domestic cement production, reduced partly the domestic deficit, and helped in holding down the price of a bag of cement in the country.\n\nDangote Cement is sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest cement producer with an installed capacity of 48.6Mta across 10 African countries and operates a fully integrated \u201cquarry-to-customer\u201d business with activities covering manufacturing, sales, and distribution of cement. It has a long-term credit rating of AAA+ by GCR and Aa2.ng by Moody\u2019s due to its market leading position, significant operational scale and strong financial profile evidenced by the company\u2019s robust operating and net profit margins relative to regional and global peers, adequate working capital, satisfactory cash flow and low leverage.\n\nDangote Cement is a subsidiary of Dangote Industries Limited, a diversified and fully integrated conglomerate as well as a leading brand across Africa in businesses such as cement, sugar, salt, beverages, and real estate, with new multi-billion-dollar projects underway in the oil and gas, petrochemical and agricultural sectors.

          "text": "Palpable fear has gripped residents of Tunga Maje village, near Zuba in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja following the invasion and abduction of scores at the Hilltop Hotel lodge located in the area.\n\nDAILY POST had reported that unknown gunmen on Thursday, stormed the hotel premises and abducted Hon. Friday Sani Makama, Prince Frederick Adejoh and others yet to be identified.\n\nHon Makama was a former lawmaker in the Kogi State House of Assembly who recently dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and joined the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nHe was abducted alongside Prince Adejoh who is currently the Oma Onu Aya of Igala land.\n\nFear grips Abuja residents as kidnappers, bandits close in on Nigeria\u2019s capital\n\nIt was gathered that the suspected kidnappers invaded the area, shooting sporadically to scare security guards away before whisking the victims away to an unknown destination.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the incident disrupted daily economic activities in the area as residents were plunged into unusual tension over more attacks.\n\nA motor spare parts dealer in Zuba Market who identified himself simply as Kelechi, told DAILY POST correspondent that some residents living near the hotel have deserted the area for a safer place.\n\n\u201cThings we use to hear from a very far place have gradually come to us here in FCT. According to what we heard, the gunmen were heavily armed with sophisticated weapons.\n\n\u201cIf they can attack the hotel with the kind of security they have there, then what do you think would happen to the common man? These criminals don\u2019t care whether you are rich or poor. They attack everybody.\n\n\u201cWe heard that some workers who are just hustling to get what to eat were also abducted. So who is safe? We are all in.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of FCT, Mr Aruna Omoha lamented the security situation in the nation\u2019s capital, revealing that the number of unreported cases supersede the ones reported.\n\n\u201cIn FCT, criminals are silently killing residents on a daily basis without the knowledge of the media and even the security agencies. Most times, when the assailants abduct a resident, they would warn the family members not to involve the police or the media.\n\n\u201cDue to fear of the victim being killed, the family members would not report the case and that is how the ransom will be paid and anything on the contrary, the victim will be killedd\u201d, he said.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the Tunga Maje and the Kaduna-Abuja highway has been a den for kidnappers and hoodlums who usually move into the city at will launch mayhem on innocent residents.\n\nThere have been series of attacks in several parts of the city by criminal elements who migrated from the neighbouring sates like Niger, Kaduna States and others where banditry is currently surging.\n\nA security personnel who pleaded not to be mentioned in print, expressed fear over possible invasion of the city by the Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cWhat we can\u2019t tell is how these elements get into the city despite the level of tight security in many parts of the territory.\n\n\u201cIt is my fear that the Boko Haram may also gain entrance into the city like they did in Niger. Some of the places they captured in Niger State are not far from the FCT. We all have to be vigilant\u201d, he said.\n\nRecall that on May 21, this year, the Nigeria Police Force alerted the general public of possible attacks by Boko Haram terrorists and other criminal elements in the cities of Abuja and Jos, Plateau State.\n\nThe alert was contained in a letter addressed to the Commissioners of Police and the Command Headquarters of\n\nthe FCT/Plateau State and signed by Ag. CP Idowu Owhunwa, Principal Staff Officer to the Acting Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cIntelligence report at the disposal of the Inspector-General of Police has uncovered plan by Boko Haram Terrorists to attack major cities in the country, particularly in Jos, Plateau State and the FCT, Abuja,\u201d it stated.\n\nWhen contacted by DAILY POST correspondent, the spokesperson for the FCT Police Command, ASP Mariam Yusuf confirmed the latest development.",

So when I talk about creation of jobs through SMEs, I am talking from the vantage point of experience.\n\n\u201cThankfully, Anambra has a vast number of self-starters. The state\u2019s organised private sector is ranked in the top three nationally as the most vibrant, capitalized and intrusive. All the government needs to do is to implement sensible policies that will offer our people the needed support and enabling environment to unleash their creativity and enterprise.\n\nShoot order won\u2019t end South-East insecurity \u2013 Onyemelukwe cautions police, military\n\n\u201cThe plans to do these have been perfected.

          "text": "The General Overseer (GO) of Christ Foundation Miracle Int\u2019l Chapel, Prophet Josiah Chukwuma Onuoha has chided clerics, especially those denigrating late Prophet Temitope Balogun (TB) Joshua in death, advising them to leave judgment to God.\n\nHe said most of the clerics criticizing the late Prophet were being driven by envy.\n\nHe advised that all, especially public servants and pastors, should take a cue from the passing of Prophet Joshua and realize that God can take anybody\u2019s life \u201csuddenly and instantly without any warning sign.\u201d\n\nProphet Onuoha, who stated this during a media chat expressed dismay that even men of God, who he said should know better, were among those disparaging the person and style of the late founder of the Synagogue Church of all Nations, who died on June 5, 2021, seven days to his 58th birthday.\n\nPrimate Ayodele lists true prophets in Nigeria\n\nAlthough Prophet Onuoha noted that he was not in a position to judge anybody and that \u201cI never met TB Joshua and didn\u2019t know him one-on-one. But I loved his good works of charity and remarkable humility.\u201d\n\nHe advised that people should allow God to judge the late prophet, \u201cwho had already finished his race on earth and gone to rest\u201d.\n\nWhile alleging that most of the clergymen who criticised Prophet TB Joshua were driven by sheer envy, Onuoha charged all clerics to emulate TB\u2019s style of unlimited humility and charity works.\n\nHe said: \u201cHe ran a good race. Pray for TB Joshua\u2019s soul and thank God for using him effectively to touch many lives.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of God told me that Prophet TB Joshua had accomplished his assignment on earth and that his time was up.\n\n\u201cAfter I heard about his death and was praying, the Lord showed me where the prophet was on top of a long truck fully loaded with rice, sweating as he distributed bags of rice to people.\n\n\u201cHe was wearing shorts and a T-shirt and personally unloading the bags of rice, which represents when he was working on earth. The man has accomplished his duties on earth and gone to rest and some people are still here labouring assiduously to tarnish his good works.\n\nOnly church businesses, investments surviving in Nigerian economy \u2013 Bishop Oyedepo\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, Prophet Joshua ran a good race but many people refused to acknowledge his good works out of sheer jealousy.\n\n\u201cHe was a very humble man of God who always helped poor widows and the less privileged.\n\n\u201cThose who had issues with his style and condemned him should realize that only God heals, Satan does not heal or do good.\n\n\u201cIf it was the evil spirit, as had been alleged in some quarters, that TB Joshua operated with, then such \u2018demons\u2019 should be commended for feeding, healing, liberating and empowering several people across the world through the Prophet.\n\n\u201cI have a family friend that was cured of her infirmity during one of TB\u2019s ministration. The late Prophet fed many widows and took care of several needy individuals across the world through financial assistance,\u201d he further stated.\n\n\u201cDid any beneficiary of his regular rice distribution die after consuming the food? Did anyone die after receiving financial assistance from him?\n\n\u201cCome to think of it, those that are now fighting the man after his death, assuming their castigations hold any water, what effort did they make to correct him when he was alive?\n\n\u201cAll the men of God that are condemning TB Joshua today, how many times did they approach him to advise him? How many times did they gather to offer corporate prayers for TB Joshua, his church and family?\n\n\u201cEvery good Nigerian, not only Christians, should stand by the Joshua family and mourn with them because the church, Yorubaland and Nigeria as a whole recorded a huge loss in Prophet TB Joshua\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI watched Emmanuel TV the day the man died and I saw many widows crying at the gate, lamenting helplessly and asking who will now take care of us now that daddy is gone? To such people, TB was their all.\n\n\u201cI know several people that got their healing through TB\u2019s prayers and ministrations. To such people, he was God-sent. And all those were done with evil powers, then that demon must be a good guy.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame that all sorts of evil would be happening in the country and you hardly find men of God speak up. But they quickly find their voices at the death of a cleric like them.\n\n\u201cLet all those castigating the late prophet pray to be like him and touch lives like him to make the world a better place.\n\n\u201cLet politicians and evil men learn from TB Joshua\u2019s case that death can strike anybody anytime no matter the level of one\u2019s smartness, position, age, location, sex or personality.\n\n\u201cTB Joshua did a lot of charity and God honours those that do good works.\n\n\u201cIf his good deeds superseded his sins, he will surely obtain favour from God,\u201d he said.",

Atiku Bagudu, NAN reports\n\nHe said it was saddening that the criminality that plagued some states in the north had crept into Kebbi.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy that the challenges of banditry and kidnapping that plagued Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto and even Kaduna did not affect Kebbi.\n\n\u201cKebbi was an Island of peace in a sea of banditry, the recent development is disturbing, it portends a serious danger to security in the North-West region\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari orders Army, Police to treat bandits in language they understand\n\nThe governor stated that the insecurity currently affecting the state would negatively impact on food production.\n\n\u201cKebbi has become the centre of rice production in the country, rice is eaten by many Nigerians, this is another reason this development is disturbing,\u201d he said.\n\nEl-Rufai also explained that the Kaduna state government is doing its best to tackle the security challenges in the state, and commended the Federal Government for its support.\n\n\u201cAs a state government, there is a limit to what we can do, we have no full control over the army, the police or the air force.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies have been doing their best, we all need to do more, we all have to play our roles in the circumstance we find ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor expressed optimism that the security challenges in the region would soon be completely stamped out.\n\nIn his remarks, Bagudu, commended El-Rufai for the visit and prayers for the state, saying that he had shown visible commitment to the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cYou have championed series of meetings to foster inter-state collaboration in tackling this monster,\u201d he said.\n\nBagudu said that the abduction of school children was a direct affront on the future of the country and not just Kebbi.\n\nThe governor commended security agencies for the proactive steps being taken to rescue the students.\n\n\u201cWe need to all show commitment towards restoring law and order in our land, we cannot allow this type of incidents to intimidate us,\u201d he said.",

Nwaoboshi (Spon), representing the good people of Delta North Senatorial District at the Senate, was drawn to the purportedly satirical and hurriedly conspiratorial, very laughable caricature of an action by the Delta State Working Committee of the PDP, purportedly suspending him from the party, as signed by its Publicity Secretary on Wednesday, June 23, 2021.\n\n\u201cSpon notes curiously that this irrational, laughable, illegal and unconstitutional action of this bunch of alarmingly, anti-democratic forces masquerading as the State Working Committee (SWC) is against the principles of fair hearing \u2013 Audi Alteram Paten \u2013 as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution, a document that supersedes all other documents.\u201d\n\nThe senator said the PDP constitution does not empower ward, local government or State Executive Committee (SEC) to consider disciplinary cases against governors and members of the National Assembly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statement added: \u201cCuriously and very authoritatively, the PDP 2017 Constitution, as amended, Chapter 10, Article 57(7), Page 99, states categorically: \u2018Notwithstanding any other provision relating to discipline, no Executive Committee at any level, except the National Executive Committee, shall entertain any question of discipline as may relate or concern a member of the National Executive Committee, deputy governors or members of the National Assembly, provided that nothing in the constitution shall preclude or invalidate any complaint submitted through\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cBy these provisions, the State Working Committee has demonstrated complete undemocratic and anti-constitutional behavior which has rendered their uncharitable pronouncement on the suspension of Spon, purportedly, as null and void and of no consequence whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe senator urged his supporters to remain calm despite the unbecoming action by those he called anti-democratic elements in Delta State PDP.",

          "title": "Anyone accusing military of conniving with bandits hallucinating -CDS",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nChief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, yesterday, debunked allegation by Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi, that soldiers were colluding with bandits, saying those harbouring such thoughts were hallucinating and needed their heads examined.\n\nHe also said the Federal Government is engaging retired senior military officers across the six geo-political zones to tackle security challenges like banditry, terrorism, armed robbery, pipeline vandalism, arms proliferation, herders-farmers clashes, violence by secessionist groups and other violent crimes.\n\nIrabor made this known at an interaction with retired senior military officers in the South West at the Headquarters of 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Odogbo, Ibadan.\n\nOn Gumi\u2019s allegations, he said: \u201cAnyone who is hallucinating with the idea that the military or other security agencies are conniving, I think needs to have himself checked. Do you connive with someone to take your life? That of course is a question that should dismiss that kind of allusion any day. All you need to know is that yes, on daily basis, because of the technological tools available to everyone of us, it is not impossible that criminally-minded individuals may take advantage of these tools. That is the reason on daily basis, we are reassessing our operational engagements, to ensure that our engagements are intelligence-driven, and equally know that these bad elements, who live among us need be exposed.\u201d\n\nGumi on Wednesday alleged that bandits engaged in kidnappings and killing of victims in the North worked in collaboration with some security officers to facilitate the movement of arms across the border into the country for their use.\n\nBut the Army through its spokesman, Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, denied the allegation saying it was a calculated attempt to denigrate the military and embolden criminals.\n\nIrabor, however, said the country was under serious threat which necessitated the engagement of retired officers to assist in resolving security challenges, especially in regions where they live.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are various security issues, and we have identified our retired colleagues, who have sold out to the unity, peace and progress of our nation. This speaks to their sense of patriotism and zeal. We believe that in their retirement, they would be better instruments of sensitisation of those who live around them on issues bordering on peace and security.\u201d\n\nIrabor said the visit to Ibadan was to interact with the retired officers to find out their observations and recommendations on how to improve security in the country.\n\n\u201cAfter the South West geo-political zone, we will go to other geo-political zones. I think that we can only leverage the wealth of experience that they have to be able to do this. That is why we are here. I believe it will be better for all of us at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nChief of Defence, Civil Military Cooperation, Rear Admiral Frederick Agu, admitted that insecurity in the country has risen to a level where the armed forces require variety of inputs from different stakeholders to combat it\n\nGeneral Officer Commanding (GOC), 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Major General Gold Chibuisi, commended the CDS for his wisdom in creating a platform to tap from wealth of experiences of retired senior officers with a view to finding a lasting solution to current security challenges confronting the country.\n\n\u201cI want to remind the retired senior officers that they have crucial roles in a time like this when the armed forces in Nigeria is fully engaged in combating emerging security challenges nationwide. These challenges range from armed robbery, banditry activities, violence by the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists, pipeline vandalism, arms proliferation, kidnapping, and herders-farmers clashes, and continuous attacks on security personnel by violent secessionist groups. These problems have put the Police on the spotlight, and necessitated the deployment of the armed forces in almost all the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cThe precision with which hoodlums carry out their attacks call for concern by all loyal and patriotic Nigerians. Innocent souls have continued to be lost amid these crises, as well as valuable property, institutions, and infrastructure. No doubt, this growing insecurity has contributed to economic stress and joblessness. Thus, this forum provides a veritable platform.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), yesterday, reinstated its position that it was not after northerners but terrorists killing and maiming people in the South East.\n\nMedia and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, stated this in a statement where it debunked allegation by Sheikh Gumi that herdsmen were better off than Eastern Security Network (ESN) and IPOB.\n\nHe also accused Gumi of using his comments to blackmail IPOB in order to continue the military presence in the South East.\n\nThe cleric was quoted to have while comparing the two groups indicted IPOB for arson and killing while herdsmen were only kidnapping for ransom. But Powerful said there was no truth in the claim by Gumi.\n\n\u201cIn case the self-acclaimed Islamic cleric has forgotten, may we remind him that neither IPOB nor ESN is a terrorist organisation or killers like his bandit clients and allies. Spilling of blood is never part of our mandate. ESN is a child of necessity created for the defence of our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen wrecking havok across our communities. ESN is only defending our hapless mothers and sisters who have been raped, maimed and attacked without any justification by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSince December 2020 when ESN was set up by our leader, these vampires have been on the run because of the heat from our gallant operatives across Biafran forests. For Sheikh Gumi who never gave a hoot while killer herdsmen rampaged our communities to try to twist the fact now is not only a mischief, but an act of terror itself.\u201d\n\nPowerful insisted \u201cno northerner in any part of Biafra land can prove that he/she has at any time been attacked by IPOB or ESN. We are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind the killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land. Gumi should be ashamed that an Islamic cleric as he claims has suddenly become a mouthpiece for bandits and terrorists. Why Gumi has special interest in bandits and terrorists is an indication that he is a terrorist who has never shown any empathy to victims of other Nigerians.\u201d",

Friday Sani Makama, Prince Frederick Adejoh and others yet to be identified, were taken away in a commando style from the Hilltop Hotel, where they lodged in the early hours of yesterday.\n\nMakama, who is said to be a former lawmaker in the Kogi State House of Assembly, recently defected from the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), while Prince Adejoh is the Oma Onu Aya of Igala land.\n\nResidents told Daily Sun that the armed men, who came in their numbers, had shot sporadically into the air, causing residents of the village and security guards on duty at the hotel to run for their lives, while they got inside and kidnapped the guests and the owner of the hotel.\n\nFor some time now, Tunga Maje and the Kaduna-Abuja Highway had become dens for kidnappers and hoodlums who, on a daily basis, rob motorists, villagers and other road users.\n\nThe management of the hotel has since reported the incident which happened in the early hours of yesterday to the police.\n\nIt was gathered that other guests, who were lucky to escape from being kidnapped, have relocated from the hotel to a safer place.\n\nWhen contacted, FCT Police public relations officer, Mariam Yusuf, who confirmed the incident, said the command has launched a manhunt to rescue the kidnapped victims alive and arrest their abductors.\n\nShe told Daily Sun that, \u201cthe command has launched a strategic operation to rescue the victims unhurt.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria will Soon Overcome its Security Challenges, Says Osinbajo",
          "text": "\u2022UN: 350,000 killed in North-east insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed optimism that Nigeria will soon prevail over the current security challenges facing it.\n\nHe anchored his optimism on various efforts by the federal government to tackle insecurity, including the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly for approval for the procurement of military hardware for the use of the military and other security agencies.\n\nOsinbajo, while hosting the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Ajakaiye, yesterday in Abuja rallied Nigerians to support the security agencies to ensure that Nigeria is safe.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past, and that we will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the supplementary budget seeking approval for funds to enhance the capacity of the military and other security agencies is part of the concerted efforts of the federal government to beef up its response to the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president has recently constituted a committee that will look at the whole security infrastructure with a view to looking at the needs of the military, as well as the police and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose of that bill is to present some of the needs of the military, as well as of security agencies in order to be able to beef up our response to the security challenges.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also stressed the need for traditional rulers, local and state governments to collaborate with the federal government to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cAny country with this number of security challenges must respond as robustly as possible. But it is also important to bear in mind that it takes a combined effort of all of us, at the local government level, state and federal levels; all of the levels; we need to come together to tackle this issue of insecurity,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, even as the federal government is concerned about the security challenges, and will continue to ramp up efforts towards improving security nationwide, community efforts are also vital in tackling the issue from the roots.\n\nHe stated that at the level of community there is a need to take decisive action, as most of the security issues occur at the community level.\n\nOsinbajo expressed happiness that his guest has set up a committee in his domain to tackle insecurity \u201cand that you\u2019ve been able to contain the menace that we see in different parts of the country in your community.\u201d\n\nHe added that the federal government will support the community in tackling its challenges, and is also working with the Ekiti State Government on dealing with insecurity, as well as various issues.\n\nIn his remarks, Ajakaiye thanked Osinbajo for granting his delegation audience and listening to their demands, including support for the establishment of a Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in the community.\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, as a community, we have come to appreciate you (Vice President) for your diligence, hard work, commitment and loyalty; and that, we from the South-west are very proud of you. We want to assure you that we are very much in support of you. From our own end, we are doing a lot to ensure that the menace of insecurity will not remain in our domain.\u201d\n\nUN: 350,000 Killed in North-east Insurgency\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) yesterday put the death toll from the ongoing conflict with terrorists in the North-east at about 350,000 people as of the end of 2020.\n\nIt, however, projected that should the insurgency continue till 2030, the fatalities could rise to over 1.1 million.\n\nAccording to a UNDP\u2019s report on the impact of the insurgency in the North-east region presented yesterday at a virtual meeting by the Country Director, Mr. Mohammed Yahaya, at least 35,000 people have so far been killed directly by the insurgents, with 350,000 said to have died indirectly as a result of the crisis.\n\nOn the socioeconomic impact of the crisis on states in the region, the report said $27.8 billion had been lost in GDP, plunging at least 1.4 million people into poverty.\n\nThe report showed that at least 1.8 million children in the North-east are not enrolled in schools as a result of the conflict.\n\nThe UNDP said: \u201cThe full human cost of the war is much greater.\n\n\u201cAlready, many more have died from the indirect effects of the conflict.\u201d\n\nIt cited damage to agriculture, water, trade, food and healthcare.\n\nChildren younger than five accounts for more than nine out of 10 of those killed, with 170 dying every day, the UNDP added.\n\nIf the conflict continues to 2030, more than 1.1 million people may die, the agency stated.\n\n\u201cDestruction and displacement have set back development in the region by decades, and continued conflict will only further scar the region,\u201d the UNDP said.\n\nThe report said since 2009, the devastating conflict in the North-eastern Nigeria has directly resulted in the deaths of approximately 35,000 people as a consequence of insurgency.\n\nThe report warned that indirect deaths, including disease and hunger resulting from the conflict\u2019s physical and economic destruction, already far outnumber those from direct causes.\n\nThe report: \u2018Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in North-east Nigeria\u2019 added that critical aspects of progress and development, including GDP, poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, education, water availability and sanitation, may not return to pre-conflict levels even by 2030.\n\nUNDP stated that more than 90 per cent of conflict-attributable deaths are of children under the age of five.\n\nThe report said physical and economic destruction wrought by the insurgency had dismantled already fragile health and food systems.\n\nAccording to it, less than 60 per cent of health facilities in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States are fully functional, while a quarter are either completely destroyed or non-functional.\n\nThe report also lamented that attacks from insurgency have also led to massive internal displacement, with more than 1.8 million Nigerians displaced in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, while the vast majority (nearly 1.5 million) are located in Borno.\n\nThe study also showed that in addition, 1.8 million students were out of school in 2020, and without increased investment in development efforts, the average Nigerian in the North-east would have lost a full year of education by 2030.\n\nThe statement, however, acknowledged that Nigeria has made great strides in retaking and stabilising large areas of the region, stressing that continued investment in development from both national and international stakeholders is needed.\n\n\u201cWithout continued investment in development as a long-term solution, the protracted conflict in north-east Nigeria will continue to impact other parts of the country and the entire Sahel region.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for international partners and national stakeholders to ensure that funds are invested not only on life-saving and humanitarian needs but also on mid-and long-term development priorities in order to enable Nigeria to achieve the SDGs and attain the AU 2063,\u201d the report quoted UNDP Resident Representative, Yahaya, as saying.\n\nThe report noted that to overcome the conflict, development efforts need to be focused on the stabilisation of affected areas through a community-level approach that enhances physical security and access to justice, rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and basic service delivery as well as the revitalisation of the local economy such as market stalls, schools and police stations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Opposition to PIB grows with Shell\u2019s rejection of proposals on gas sector\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has said the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased global debt by $24 trillion, taking it to $281 trillion during the crisis.\n\nSpeaking at the 135th meeting of the Economic Commission Board (ECB) of OPEC, the cartel\u2019s Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, urged member countries to be wary of the inflationary effect of their borrowings as the $24 trillion is more than the United States annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nBarkindo spoke just as the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state, seeking a review of its provisions on the gas sector.\n\nBarkindo also reiterated his earlier position that oil demand will hit pre-pandemic levels by the fourth quarter of 2021 to exceed 99 million barrels per day.\n\nThe meeting of the ECB, the organisation\u2019s statutory economic think-tank, which meets in advance of the ordinary meetings of the OPEC conference, focused on reviewing the conditions of the global oil market, emerging trends related to the oil industry, including demand, supply and stock movements, as well as the recovery prospects for the world economy.\n\nBarkindo highlighted the contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) of participating countries, which continue to support the global oil market through voluntary production adjustments in the interest of market stability.\n\nOn OPEC forecast for demand recovery, Barkindo stated that the market optimism was a reaction to the more than 2.4 billion vaccine doses that have now been administered globally.\n\nAlso, there are signs that the international community is ramping up its support to developing countries to help bolster their acquisition of life-saving vaccines.\n\nHe said these efforts were drawing the world closer to bringing the pandemic under control, and thereby helping accelerate the global economic recovery, as the latest market developments point to much better conditions and improved prospects.\n\nOn market fundamentals, Barkindo stated that in terms of the global economy, the GDP growth forecast has risen from 4.4 per cent in November 2020 to 5.5 per cent in June 2021.\n\nHe added that an upward momentum into the second half of the year is being expected.\n\nHe restated his earlier forecast that China and the US will see the lion\u2019s share of growth in 2021, with China\u2019s economy expanding by 8.5 per cent and the US by 6.4 per cent.\n\nAccording to him, India, despite having to confront a devastating second-wave of COVID-19 infections is still forecast to achieve a growth of 9.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe forecast for world oil demand has decreased from 6.2 mb/d in November 2020 to 6 mb/d in June 2021. The outlook for later this year looks especially promising with demand slated to exceed 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter. This prospect would bring us back close to pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there are now encouraging signs that the worst of the pandemic is over, but warned that it is too early to jump to conclusions, especially with uncertainties surrounding mutations.\n\nBarkindo said meanwhile, debt levels in major economies continued to rise, fuelled by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes, with government debt levels, after the COVID-19 lockdowns, reaching their highest to date in both advanced economies and emerging market economies.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe absolute amount of global debt has increased by more than $24 trillion over the course of the pandemic \u2013 this is more than the annual GDP of the US. World debt now stands at $281 trillion, comparing to the annual world GDP of around $80 trillion. With this in mind, the risk of rising inflation in the months to come will need to be closely monitored.\n\n\u201cLooking at the world oil supply, non-OPEC supply growth was revised down from 0.9 mb/d in November 2020 to 0.8 mb/d in June 2021. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are anticipated to be Canada, Brazil, China and Norway, while US liquids supply is now expected to only grow by a marginal 0.03 mb/d y-o-y.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the return of Iranian production and exports will happen in a transparent and orderly fashion, supporting the deal by OPEC+ countries on ongoing efforts to rebalance the oil market and promote market stability.\n\nBarkindo also lauded the conformity to the production adjustments by member countries, which he puts at 114 per cent in April.\n\nOpposition to PIB Grows as Shell Kicks over Bill\u2019s Position on Gas Sector\n\nMeanwhile, Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state.\n\nThe company stated that the bill, if passed as it is, could throw the gas sector into more crisis and further stunt the growth of the sector, which the country is banking on for much of its revenue as the world moves towards cleaner sources of fuels.\n\nDuring the week, reports indicated that the bill, which has spent over 15 years in the National Assembly, may not be passed this month as promised by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, as key stakeholders pushed for final alterations to some specific parts of the document before it becomes law.\n\nSpeaking during an online forum organised by the British Nigeria Chamber of Commerce (NBCC), Managing Director of SNEPCo, Mr. Bayo Ojulari, called for a conference of all stakeholders, to be called by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, to resolve the differences.\n\nThemed: \u201cGas Economy: Maximising the Potential,\u201d the programme was overseen by the NBCC oil and gas group and attended, among others, by the Managing Director of the chamber, Mr Kayode Falowo, and Managing Director, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited, Mr Tony Attah.\n\nOther speakers at the event were the President of the Nigeria Gas Association (NGA) and Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG), Mr. Ed Ubong, and Gas Portfolio Manager, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Mr. Yemi Famori.\n\nOjulari stated that the PIB as it is today is not enabling enough and not fully aligned with the direction that Nigeria has articulated around the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d as propagated by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe called for a further review of the PIB to ensure that it delivers and contributes to the ambition that Nigeria has set for itself to be in the class of Qatar and Australia whose economies are largely run on revenues from gas.\n\nAccording to him, with the condition set for exportation of gas resources by companies operating in the sector, the proposed petroleum governance bill will stifle competition.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe terms and prices of gas development, especially for deep non-associated gas, need to be more competitive. Today, it is actually looking worse than it is in the current environment and that\u2019s an area that has not enjoyed a level of emphasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIB does not do any justice or to help to unlock the huge potential that we have in the non-associated gas environments. With the potential of gas to power our economy, the focus should be more on competitive discuss that will stimulate gas.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the version of the PIB that we have is not sufficient and will not enable us to incentivise investors to unlock the huge non-associated gas that we have.\u201d\n\nIn the domestic gas space, Ojulari said the PIB required the fulfilment of domestic gas obligation as a condition to export gas, which potentially puts long-term export gas supply at risk.\n\nHe added that the country needs to move away from the \u201cunproductive\u201d debate about satisfying local need before shipping gas abroad.\n\nHe called for a delicate balancing between the political drive and the business needs of the PIB, saying that many of those who discuss the matter are approaching it from the point of emotions, rather than reality.\n\nHe added: \u201c A lot of people who talk about the gas business in the gas value chain come from the emotional side. But emotion does not create a business, emotions do not attract investors, emotions do not sign contracts.\n\n\u201cSo, I will say that while we recognise those emotional elements, we need to create a platform where the companies and the entities that have these resources will come together in a conference facilitated by the minister of state and let us have that conversation.\u201d\n\nHe stated that everybody is currently doing the economics of the gas sector from their own point of view, and there\u2019s no consensus on the way forward for the gas sector in the PIB.\n\nHe wondered why the NLNG model was not adopted since it has been tested to be workable, explaining that there is sufficient gas resource that will meet both domestic and gas export.\n\nIn his remarks, Attah stated that energy has always been in transition, adding that there should be no surprise about the current talks about renewables.\n\nWith 7.8 billion persons on earth and an additional 2.8 billion by 2050, he said the world would always require energy to function, while gas will continue to be relevant.\n\nAccording to him, the energy of the future must look at the sustainability of the environment and which does not emit massive carbon like coal, oil and others.\n\nHe stated that gas is cheaper and could be either a transition or destination fuel, adding that a future without gas is almost inconceivable.\n\nBill to Be Laid Tuesday\n\nMeanwhile, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has assured the nation that the PIB would be laid on Tuesday by its joint committees on the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we are dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s on the PIB; the Petrol Industry Bill, and by the grace of God, our committees, the joint committees, will finish their work on it by the end of the week, hopefully. The reports would be laid on Tuesday in both chambers. This is what we have planned and this is what we\u2019re working towards.\u201d\n\nHe also said much work had been done on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and it would be passed before the National Assembly proceeds on its annual vacation next month.\n\n\u201cWe also have some work to do on the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill. Our committee in the Senate and indeed, in the House have worked jointly and we have very little to do really, to get the reports and considered in the two chambers.\n\n\u201cWe expect that we\u2019ll do that before we go on our annual summer recess, which comes up on the 15th of July, by the grace of God. \u201cSo, before we go on summer recess, we should be able to pass the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly will also work on the confirmation of nominees for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commissionership as well as passing the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill sent to it last week by the president.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Delta State Government yesterday called for the speedy reconstitution of the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to avert the 2016 experience when the resurgence of militancy plunged Nigeria into recession.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Dr. Kingsley Otuaro, while featuring yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, described the non-constitution of the board as a flagrant abuse of the commission\u2019s Act.\n\nHe said the situation was doing more harm than good to the oil-rich region.\n\nHe described as untenable, the assurance of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, that the board would be constituted after an ongoing forensic audit.\n\nOtuaro also allayed fears of a political storm in the state over the zoning arrangement for the governorship position, saying the issue would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe said the non-constitution of the board of the NDDC could trigger militancy in the region following the recent ultimatum issued by the Ijaw Youth Council and oil communities\u2019 rights activist, Chief Government Ekpemupolo, known as Tompolo.\n\nHe stated that following Tompolo\u2019s ultimatum, Akpabio had engaged in wide consultations in the region.\n\nOtuaro said he was part of the consultative meetings and was also very much aware of the fact that consensus reached in the inner meetings was that the board would be constituted at the close of this month.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe expectation of all those who are involved in that critical engagement is that the board will be constituted at the close of this month.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything to the contrary, Senator Akpabio knows exactly what to do. He has to reach out because any gap in the circumstance will be misconstrued for something else.\n\n\u201cAnd for us in Delta State Government, we don\u2019t want a repeat of what happened in 2016 that boxed us up into a recessionary period, where there was a resurgence of militancy in the region. And then we observed the breaches of critical oil and gas facilities where the Trans-Forcados 48-inch line was breached and production output was cut.\u201d\n\nHe said the position of the state government was in tandem with the position held by critical stakeholders in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have a strong opinion that the long delay and the non-constitution or the substantive board of the NDDC is a flagrant abuse of the Act, establishing the NDDC.\n\n\u201cThat is the position of the Delta State Government and like you have said, the NDDC cannot be like a sole proprietorship business, because it is not meant to be so.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that South-south governors met and in their resolution, they affirmed that the board should be constituted immediately.\n\nThe governors, he said, also recommended that financial receipts in favour of the NDDC should be lodged in an escrow account, adding that this was borne out of the fact that the sole proprietorship leadership \u2013 the interim leadership of the NDDC is unknown to the NDDC Act.\n\nHe stated that the recent visit by Akpabio to the region for consultation had calmed frayed nerves as the government may not have contained the likely unwholesome situation that would have arisen.\n\n\u201cThe recent spate of ultimatums given by the Ijaw Youth Council and some other critical stakeholders, including that of Government Ekpemupolo, is also in tandem with the position of the Senator Ifeanyi Okowa-led government and that of the South-south governors and that of PANDEF led by Chief EK Clark,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the state government was thankful to God that Akpabio, \u201cesteemed and distinguished for his transformation agenda while he was governor Akwa Ibom State had cause to come to the Niger Delta region to consult with the critical stakeholders and I\u2019m thankful to God that he came.\u201d\n\nOtuaro added that if the minister had sat in his office, there would have been some unwholesome scenes in relation to the ultimatum that they had given.\n\n\u201cSo I want to say that it is the expectation of the critical stakeholders that the board should be constituted,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the position that the board would be constituted when the government is done with the forensic audit, is untenable against the backdrop of the fact that the board can be constituted and the forensic audit can be going on.\n\nOn the rising tension over zoning of the governorship position and the recent dissolution of the cabinet by Okowa, the deputy governor said the situation would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe added that he reserved the right to run for the governorship election but was non-committal over whether or not he would run in view of the zoning arrangement in place.\n\nHe stated that it was within the powers of his boss to effect a change of cabinet.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is within the powers of the Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, to dissolve his cabinet and reappoint those he feels very strongly that can help us deliver on a stronger Delta Agenda, because that truly is our agenda, one that truly is stronger and more secured Delta State for tomorrow.\n\n\u201cSo, that is in the exercise of his power and there\u2019s no problem about that and we are happy with it and I think the people are also happy with it.\n\n\u201cAs to the questions you have thrown up with regards to contesting or indicating interest, zoning and all of that, I don\u2019t want to get myself into all of that. I am a Deltan; I am a Nigerian, like any other person. So, we all have the rights to aspire to elective positions. I have the right to aspire within the context of the law. I can aspire. But it is not my place to tell you if I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning of the governorship seat to South, North or Central Senatorial Districts, are all politics.\n\nOtuaro stated that the leadership of the state, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will look into what is fair and just for the people of the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\n\n\u201cTwo, you cannot, in my view and judgment, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructure development.

He was trying to make advances on me. I was tired and he became violent on it. I let him have his way. Towards afternoon, he ordered roofies. We took it together and ate food. He became high. I was still not happy with the first one (sex) that we had. So, I was staying on my own, smoking and drinking. He, too, was on his own.\n\n\u201cHe came to me and I was like I am not happy with what he did. I was like, \u2018You don\u2019t help me, you don\u2019t assist me with anything, you are just playing with me around\u2019. He was like, \u2018Take my ATM and withdraw what you want\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe later became violent trying to get to me and I was resisting and defending myself. At some point, he hit my\n\nhead on the wall and I also retaliated.\n\n\u201cAt some point, he was chasing me around the kitchen cabinet. I took a knife and stabbed his neck. I approached the door and he followed me. I stabbed him twice on the neck side. I threw the knife to the bed and he was going for it but I also went for\n\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe dragged the knife with me and it broke and he fell on the floor.\u201d\n\nThe undergraduate also disclosed that after stabbing the late CEO, she withdrew N380,000 from his account using his ATM card.\n\nOdumosu said efforts were ongoing to apprehend and cause other culprits involved in the heinous crime to face the full weight of the law and justice done in the matter.\n\nAccording to him, the suspect had conspired with others, now at large, to murder Ataga.\n\nHe said part of the exhibits recovered were one drivers\u2019 licence, complimentary cards, Access Bank Statement of Account and one Nigeria International Passport with No.B50010434 belonging to the suspect, one fake driver\u2019s licence bearing Mary Johnson with the suspect\u2019s photograph.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says 34,457 people were killed by insurgents in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states between 2009 and early 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2020 report titled: \u2018Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in North-east Nigeria\u2019, the agency said insurgency has crippled development across various sectors in the region.\n\nUNDP, however, noted that outside the almost 35,000 fatalities recorded as a direct result of insurgency, there have been hundreds of thousands of people who have died over causes indirectly related to conflict in the north-east.\n\n\u201cInsurgent violence and terrorism carried out by Boko Haram and Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) remain the major driver of insecurity across north-eastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region,\u201d the report reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe effects of the insurgency and the persistence of insecurity are inseparable from the region\u2019s pre-existing socio-economic deprivation and harsh environmental conditions.\n\n\u201cThe BAY states \u2014 Borno, Adamawa and Yobe \u2014were not only some of the poorest states in the country prior to conflict, but they also continue to bear the brunt of its effects.\n\n\u201cAs of 31 July 2020, conflict has directly resulted in 34,457 deaths in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states since the beginning of 2009.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConflict can also increase mortality indirectly. For example, destroyed health infrastructure and degraded living conditions can lead to increased deaths from disease and hunger. To our knowledge, there have been no prior efforts to estimate the number of indirect deaths from this conflict.\u201d\n\nDISPLACEMENT\n\nThe agency lamented that insurgency in the three states led to the displacement of over 1.8 million people before the end of 2020.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram attacks have led to massive internal displacement. More than 1.8 million Nigerians are displaced in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states, with the vast majority (nearly 1.5 million) located in Borno,\u201d UNDP noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn camps and host communities, IDPs often live in poor conditions and lack access to adequate food and services.\u201d\n\nPOVERTY\n\nUNDP also said the insurgency in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe led to an intense level of poverty in Nigeria, adding that \u201cas of 2019, 81 percent of people living in Yobe, 64 percent in Borno, and 60 percent in Adamawa suffer from multidimensional poverty, a measure that accounts for deprivation with respect to standards of living, health, and education\u201d.\n\nHEALTH AND MORBIDITY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency maintained that insurgency has ravaged the region, leading to severe and acute malnutrition of thousands of children.\n\n\u201cOver 920,000 children in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe are estimated to have global acute malnutrition (GAM), while over 288,000 have severe acute malnutrition (SAM),\u201d UNDP said.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has also rendered 85 percent of Borno territory inaccessible to humanitarian agencies, constraining the ability to provide aid.\u201d\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the report, the frequent attacks on schools have also left a damaging impact on the educational system in the region.\n\n\u201cConflict has been especially damaging to education, as schools have been targeted directly by insurgents,\u201d UNDP said.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, we estimate that 1.8 million students are out of school who would have been enrolled if not for conflict.\n\n\u201cBy 2030, in the Conflict scenario, the average Nigerian in the BAY states will have had a full year (20 percent) of education less than expected in the No Conflict scenario. This setback in human development will require decades to recover from.\u201d\n\nThe report noted that while the federal government has made \u201cgreat strides in retaking and stabilising large portions of the region\u201d, it has only recorded \u201climited success\u201d in putting and end to the insurgency.\n\nThe UNDP report added that it would be difficult to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the region even if the insurgency ends \u2014 considering the level of damage already done in various areas.",

          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "A Nigerian-Taiwanese couple, on their love for online gaming",
          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "On Tuesday, June 22, 2021, Facebook announced interesting eCommerce updates coming to its products. The company disclosed this on its blog, Facebook Newsroom.\n\nStating that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 made online shopping more appealing to people, Facebook wants to make shopping across its apps easier for users.\n\nStatista showed a rise in eCommerce sales in 2020, with global online sales increasing from $3.35 trillion in 2019 to $4.89 trillion in 2020.\n\nTo take advantage of this unprecedented rise, the company rolled out Facebook Shops on May 19, 2020. Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "The emergence of Charles Chukwuma Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State, has been received with excitement in some quarters.\n\nSoludo has remained a respected economic policy authority in Nigeria since leaving the CBN, credited as the only CBN governor in recent times to ensure a single-digit inflation rate for 24 consecutive months.\n\nFor some observers, Soludo\u2019s emergence and eventual success at the poll may perhaps be the beginning of a new chapter for Anambra State based on his track record and excellent performance while in public office.\n\nA third quarter 2020 data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that Anambra State had the lowest unemployment rate in Nigeria.\n\nThe data show that only 13 percent of the 2.3 million working people in the state are unemployed in a nation where the national average unemployment rate is over 27 percent.\n\nOf course, this is a great feat by the Willie Obiano administration, which has shown great leadership promise in transforming the infrastructure of the state, attracting industries and creating a socially stable, business-friendly environment.\n\nHowever, there is the feeling among the populace that the state is not where it should be, considering its potential and promise.\n\nPundits say that based on his track record as governor of the CBN where he embarked on major transformation of the banking sector through a banking consolidation that provided trillions of naira credit to thousands of businesses and created unprecedented employment, Soludo has what it takes to transform Anambra State.\n\nThey believe he can take the state to an enviable position by creating a conducive business environment for great indigenous entrepreneurs to invest in the state, and extending the same to the whole of South Eastern region.\n\nHowever, others say the position of a state governor is a sharp contrast from being the head of the CBN, while so many factors could also count and decide his success or failure in office as state governor.\n\n\u201cSoludo should understand that the state governorship position is not like being a CBN governor, and Anambra is not like Lagos State or Rivers State that is commercial based, where there is money to execute projects.\n\n\u201cSo, if he wants to perform he may adopt stricter policy in taxation to get money from people, which may be misunderstood. I think he would perform, if the people can be patient with him, but his policies may be misunderstood initially,\u201d political commentator, Tade Ademola, says.\n\nSince 2009, when he narrowly lost the Anambra State gubernatorial election as a candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) to Peter Obi, Soludo has never hidden his intention to govern the state.\n\nAnd since moving to APGA, he has thrown his hat in the ring on several occasions without success, while consistently being a supporter of Obiano\u2019s administration. So, his decision to contest the November 6, 2021, election did not come as a surprise to many.\n\nSpeaking recently, while declaring his ambition, Soludo had said he hoped to leverage his international connections to transform the state. He said having served the global community, he was now poised to serve and develop Anambra.\n\nSoludo won the Wednesday\u2019s primaries by polling a total of 740 votes out of a total of 792 votes cast in the election.\n\nHe won three other contestants that included the member representing Orumba-North/Orumba-South Federal Constituency, Okwudili Chukwu Ezenwankwo, who scored 41 votes; Damian Okolo, 7 votes, and ThankGod Ibe, who polled 4 votes.\n\nSpeaking on the exercise, Anambra State governor, Willie Obiano, described the conduct of the primaries as most peaceful, free, fair and transparent.\n\nHe charged APGA members to brace up for the challenges of making sure that the party wins the main election, and expressed optimism that the party would repeat its victory that returned him for a second term.\n\nIn 1998, Soludo was appointed to the position of professor of economics at the University of Nigeria; the next year he became a visiting professor at Swarthmore in Swarthmore, USA.\n\nSoludo joined the Federal Government in 2003, and became the CBN governor from May 2004 to 2009.\n\nPrior to his May 2004 appointment, he held the positions of chief economic adviser to former President Obasanjo and chief executive of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria.\n\nHe is also a member of the British Department\u2019s International Advisory Group, and currently serves on the Chief Economist Advisory Council (CEAC) of the World Bank.\n\nHe is also a consultant and strategic adviser to institutional investors in Africa; a member of the Technical Advisory Group of the Natural Resource Charter, Oxford, and member and chairman of boards of several companies.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as a member of an eight-man Economic Advisory Council, which reports directly to him.",

          "text": "Most digital banking solutions focus more on payment services while the availability of credit receives little attention when it comes to digitised banking. Ergo, players in the Fintech space are making a call toward the digitisation of credit to boost the economy.\n\nThe gains of digitising the credit processes both for organisations and businesses in need of loans were discussed at a stakeholder meeting organised by the Committee of E-Business Industry Heads (CeBIH) in Lagos.\n\nIn line with the central topic, stakeholders were urged to transform credit through digital optimisation as it would foster equal access to credit facility to everyone, especially those at the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nDigital lending is seen as the process of offering loans that are applied for, disbursed, and managed through digital channels. The process is instant, automated, and remote.\n\nThe chairman of CeBIH Adeyemi Atanda said he believes that availing credit is one of the major avenues to drive economic empowerment.\n\nRead Also: 5 funding opportunities for SMEs in Nigeria\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent, he said Nigeria is at the level of two to three percent credit availability to the bottom of the pyramid, whereas in other developed countries, that ratio is about 40 percent.\n\nFurther checks show that Nigeria\u2019s overall financial inclusion target was 80 percent by 2020. EFInA data shows that only 64 percent of Nigerian adults were financially included by the end of 2020, meaning that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38 million adults, remain completely financially excluded.\n\nOn the issue of financial inclusion, women remain more financially excluded than men, with only 45 percent of women using formal financial services, compared with 56 percent of men.\n\n\u201cThis means that Nigeria is very far from the target,\u201d Atanda said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t make credit available to people, SMEs will not grow, businesses will not be able to expand and we\u2019ll not be able to create employment which actually is supposed to drive our economy.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said there is a need for home-grown solutions to be able to drive digital credit optimization as every solution imported is paid in FX and there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the Naira right now.\n\n\u201cSo, to reduce that, we need to grow our own solutions locally,\u201d he adds.\n\nAlthough cultural behaviour, regulation and enabling environment, IT infrastructure, and organisational structure were some identified challenges at the event, Anino Akperi, CEO, Money Mall, said digital innovations should be designed in such a way that Nigerians can have access to loans.\n\nHe argued that a lot has changed in the credit space as the sector has moved beyond manual processing of things: manual customer acquisition, manual credit processing, disbursement, and other processes.\n\nCommending CeBIH for being able to bring to show that every aspect of banking can be digitalised, and not just payment systems and money transfers, he noted that the credit area is a critical aspect of banking and if digitised, it will help the banks to reduce their cost of customer acquisition, cost of credit administration, and also help those that are seeking facilities to be able to get money easily.\n\nMost importantly, the issue of credit concentration is eliminated with digitized credit, according to Akperi, who said more than 40 percent of loans granted in Nigeria are within three sectors: oil and gas, construction, and maybe government.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the rest,\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cAnd that also points out something: whenever we have issues around oil price, non-performing loans in the industry go up. So, critically, every lender will need to diversify, spread out these loans.\n\n\u201cLet the loans no longer be concentrated in Lagos. Let the man in Damaturu, and Eket have equal access such that the opportunities that exist there, the people can take advantage of it and do well and it helped the entire economy.\u201d\n\nSteve Bireley, chief technology officer, Lokyata, advised Fintechs to find ways to measure the effectiveness of digital optimisation because with measurement, they will not know how effective their optimisation is.\n\nCeBIH is constituted of the upper echelon of electronic business industry practitioners in all Banks in Nigeria with its major and most important objective being the promotion of electronic banking services in line with global best practices.\n\nThis event is one of its activities at driving awareness across the industry.",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: Inside Delta community which existence is threatened by flooding",
          "text": "Morgan Agidi, 84, stood at the eroded shore of Abari creek, gesturing as he spoke about the havoc flooding has wreaked on the living and the dead in his community.\n\n\u201cMost of our (late) fathers, their bones are now in the river. When they die, we bury them but erosion carries them away into the river,\u201d the octogenarian said.\n\nAbari is one of the communities on the bank of the River Niger in Patani Local Government Area of Delta State. The town is on the verge of becoming a historical reference with the yearly flood gradually washing it into the river.\n\nAccording to a research paper by Adaku Echendu, the erosion is caused by the Niger Delta coastal flood, which has left no fewer than three million persons displaced.\n\nIt is estimated that the town loses about five to six houses and farmlands to the flood annually.\n\nThis leaves many in the town and other coastal areas with only the option of relocation from the area or taking temporary accommodation with the few whose structures are yet to be impacted.\n\nA study has shown the havoc that the Niger Delta coastal flood causes annually. Climate change vulnerability is a major issue of urgent policy attention among poor coastal regions.\n\nThe Nigerian Environmental Study /Action Team (NEST) reported that sea-level rise and repeated ocean surges will not only worsen the problems of coastal erosion but will increase the problem of floods, the intrusion of seawater into freshwater sources and the ecosystems. These will affect agriculture, fisheries, and general livelihoods.\n\nA prediction in 2007 by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says rising global temperatures will contribute to an upsurge in several floods, drought, glacier melt, and sea-level rise.\n\nIn developing countries, the pressure is expected to intensify especially on land and water resources, disrupt agricultural production and threaten food security.\n\nThe treasurer of Abari town, Peremobowei Dakromoh, said erosion is an age-long problem, which he grew up to understand as a norm.\n\n\u2018Normally, human beings die before houses. But in this community, houses die before human beings,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, in his late twenties, Mr Peremobowei said his family members had been victims of the disaster. Stretching his hands in the direction of the waterside and snapping his fingers, Mr Dakromoh said the house his late father built was swept off by erosion.\n\nHe said the government has turned a blind eye to the plight of the residents.\n\n\u201cAbari community is the first ward of Patani local government but \u2018we no know if we be part of this Nigeria,\u201d he lamented in pidgin English.\n\nDifficulties with farming, business\n\nMr Peremobowei said the main occupations of the residents are farming and fishing, but farmers and fishermen have problems taking their products to markets outside the community because there are no motorable roads.\n\nAccording to him, farmers now take their goods to the nearest market through wooden or engine boats, which he said adds between N7,000 and N10,000 to their transportation cost.\n\n\u201cThis could be half the value of the whole farm product, resulting in little or no gain,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIzon-Ebi Gobagha is the secretary of the town\u2019s association. He said moving crops from the farm to the nearest village for sale is even harder when the flood comes.\n\n\u201cSometimes the floods scare many farmers because sometimes our boats sink,\u201d she said.\n\nThe community\u2019s youth association chairman, Ogbotobo Godday, said farming activities have drastically reduced in the community.\n\n\u2018This community used to produce about 3,600 tonnes of yam every year, but there is nothing to write home about the figure anymore. It is frustrating.\u201d\n\nA young farmer, Ogboteh George, said the flood has dealt badly with farmers in Abari.\n\n\u201cIt (flood) has affected us so badly; so much that youth outside the community can be seen owning houses, owning okada, owning cars but we in this community have nothing.\n\n\u201cEven at our farms, when we plant our crops, they get flooded within a year, killing our crops. We are so sad about this, to be very honest,\u201d Mr Ogboteh said.\n\nHospitals, others affected\n\nIt is not only the economic endeavours that are suffering, other parts of peoples lives are also affected in the community.\n\nThere is no functional health centre or hospiral in the community and ill residents have to seek help from neighbouring communities.\n\n\u201cWe are begging the government to come and help us because we are suffering. Imagine people who are sick, before we call a boat from the nearest community, the person would have died. In short, I want to believe we are not part of the local government in Delta State. They forget us in every aspect of development,\u201d Mrs Gobagha said.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Peremobowei said, the educational sector in the town has also been affected.\n\nHe said teachers often reject posting to the community, \u201cbecause there are no motorable roads and most of them are afraid to travel by water.\u201d\n\nNDDC intervention and failed government efforts\n\nThe National President of Abari Union, Peter Pibowei, said the community had made a series of appeals since 2012 to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and other government agencies for the construction of shorelines and motorable roads. He said the appeals were all ignored.\n\nAlso, a former Chairman of Patani Local Government Area, Perez Omoun, said he had written articles, letters, and recommendations to the state and federal governments on the problems of Abari.\n\nNDDC, which was set up to address infrastructure deficit and other developmental challenges of the region, has made little impact in the region.\n\nAccording to the commission\u2019s website, in 20 years, the NDDC has awarded over 9,445 projects in the Niger Delta region. It awarded a few projects in Abari too, as shown in the table below.\n\nPROJECT YEAR AWARDED PROJECT CONTRACTOR PROJECT STATUS Construction of Home Economics, Fine Art & ICT laboratory at Abari Patani LGA, Delta state May 07, 2013 ACTIONWORKS LTD Not started Construction of Cottage Hospital in Abari, Patani L.G.A, Delta state May 31, 2012 SHADY BRIGGS NIG.

Till today, nothing has been done,\u201d he said.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES later found out that the feasibility study was assigned to Yemi Fasuyi, a consultant working for the commission.\n\nSpeaking with PREMIUM TIMES, Mr Fasuyi confirmed that in 2018, the NDDC sent him to conduct a feasibility study of the area to include \u2018the length, sea depth and pilling of shorelines.\u2019\n\nHe revealed that the report of the study with its cost has been on his desk since 2018 because \u201cwe are still debating it.\u201d\n\nMr Fasuyi said he was not sure if the shoreline contract had been awarded. But he added: \u201cEven if they want to start construction, another feasibility study needs to be taken because every year, the shore keeps collapsing and the sea depth keeps deepening.\u201d\n\nResidents of Abari lament the attitude of the government to their plight.\n\n\u201cSince I came to this town 40 years ago, we have been pleading with the government to help the town,\u201d Mr Agidi said.\n\n\u201cThey promised us heaven on earth, that they were going to help us and that we should show them where they were going to put their materials. When they came, they arranged all their materials and left. Till today, we have not seen them again,\u201d Mr Agidi said.\n\nOladapo Soneye, the spokesperson of the Nigeria Conservation Foundation, said there is a need to evacuate the area before any action is taken.\n\n\u201cThe first thing to even rescue the situation is evacuation,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking residents to a safer place because there is no way they may get help immediately and even if it is immediately, it will still take a while before any result.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mr Soneye recommended that infrastructure like \u201cgroynes which interrupt water flow, strong solid shorelines and canals\u201d be built to manage the situation.\n\nMr Soneye further warned on the future of communities in coastal areas experiencing floods.\n\n\u201cIf actions can be taken by the government and corporations on time, we can save the situation but if nothing is done, these communities in coastal areas will disappear into the water with people being displaced. In like 20-30 years from now, you won\u2019t hear anything about these communities,\u201d he warned.\n\nSupport for this report was provided by the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ) through funding support from Ford Foundation.",

In a statement issued by Philip Elueme, his legislative aide, Nwaoboshi accused Okowa of remotely controlling the action of the working committee of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is irrational, laughable, illegal and an unconstitutional action of this bunch of alarmingly, anti-democratic forces masquerading as the State Working Committee is against the principles of fair hearing \u2013 audi alteram paten \u2013 as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution, a document that supercedes all other documents,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis took another dimension yesterday as Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and suspended Senator Peter Nwaoboshi were poised for a showdown.\n\nWhile Okowa vowed to expose those that were angry with the PDP in the state and its members because he is not ready to put money in anyone\u2019s pocket, Nwaoboshi said nobody can suspend him from the PDP.\n\nThe governor said he would not be distracted by attempts to pit him against his predecessors by some highly-placed members of the PDP in the state.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAt a grand reception to welcome hundreds of former members of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Aniocha/Oshimili federal constituency to the PDP, Governor Okowa said all the governors who ruled the state since 1999 performed very well.\n\nHis statement may not be unconnected with the comments attributed to Senator Nwaoboshi early this week that former Governors James lbori and Emmanuel Uduaghan performed better than Okowa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe governor said the attempts by some persons in the state to put him on a collision course with past leaders of the state would not work as he was focused on developing Delta according to mandate freely given to him by the people.\n\n\u201cWe will not work to put money in one person\u2019s pocket because a day will come when I will expose those of them that are angry with us.\n\nYou voted for me to do what is right for the interest of the people and not to put money in somebody\u2019s pocket, that\u2019s not what you voted me for.\u201d\n\n\u201cPDP has worked start from Chief James Ibori, to Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan and myself we have worked very well and we are still working.

There is no substitute for seeing and hearing from local residents and displaced families who are finding ways to live under the most austere conditions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThe UN resident humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, Mr Edward Kallon said, \u201cThe mission today has shown the power in combining development and humanitarian efforts, and it is clear that we must accelerate these contributions and find innovative ways to end this decade-long conflict if we are to meet our global, national and state goals to build back stronger.\u201d\n\nThe delegation visited key locations where they had overview of the coordination and operational challenges relating to humanitarian and development programmes in the region.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe delegates also identified the development deficits in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states and spotlighted humanitarian needs, particularly access to service delivery, security, and the rapidly escalating food crisis in the zone.\n\nThey discussed the worsening insecurity in the region and how the protracted conflict in Nigeria had affected the Lake Chad region, including the neighbouring countries of Cameroon, Niger and Chad in the last 10 years.\n\nThey said the security situation remains highly volatile with non-state armed groups (NSAGs) continuing to target communities as well as humanitarians, including in areas that were previously considered secure.\n\nGovernor of Borno State Babagana Umara Zulum told the delegation that the visit provided the state government the opportunity to advocate for humanitarian and development efforts, and emphasise the protection of civilians in the context of a challenging and insecure operating environment and to highlight operational efforts in restoring the dignity of conflict-impacted communities through a people-centred approach paired with durable solutions.\n\nHe said, \u201cHere in the Lake Chad region, we face one of the most severe humanitarian emergencies in the world. The uncertainty arising from the conflict is hampering normal life making dependency on humanitarian assistance a necessity but an unwarranted norm.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank our committed international stakeholders for their strong partnership and generous contributions to the stabilisation of the North East, I urge for continued support from all partners to continue to join us, wholeheartedly, in taking bold steps to promote development in the region,\u201d Zulum said.\n\nThe team visited Banki in Bama local government area and Maiduguri, the state capital.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

And most important was that he spoke boldly about the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) at a time most leaders of thought and people of influence in the region were still calling them \u2018Unknown Gunmen,\u2019 cowering under their beds, afraid of speaking the truth to a rebellion gone awry.\n\nThe first person I recall who spoke boldly about IPOB/ESN was Gov Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, when he addressed the Press at the Presidential Villa some weeks back. He said he knew who the unknown gunmen were. And he mentioned the group, saying he didn\u2019t agree with their tactics, but he understood why they were doing what they were doing.\n\nAnother person who came boldly to sue for peace was former Abia State Governor, Orji Uzo Kalu. He urged the young men to sheathe their swords, and stop the self- immolation spree they were embarking on.\n\nSome other interest groups issued statements that were tepid, neither here nor there, while others spoke from both sides of the mouth. It was obvious that they didn\u2019t want to condemn the secessionist group, lest they become targets themselves. The group seemed impudent and irreverent enough to confront anybody.\n\nBut Ngige came out smoking, calling a spade a spade. He held nothing back, firing from the hips, asking for no quarter, and getting none. I was, therefore, not surprised when some days later, Governors of all the States in the South East came out as one body, denouncing secession, and expressing faith in a united Nigeria. Ngige and some few others before him had shone the light, and people were finding the way.\n\nLet\u2019s plumb the depths of the interview, and see what the former Anambra State Governor, ex-Senator, and two-time Minister said.\n\nHe was asked to comment on the security situation, first in the country generally, and then South East in particular.\n\nThe Minister made it clear that agitation for secession had always been there since return to democratic rule in 1999, under Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as President.\n\nThere was MASSOB led by Raph Uwazurike, which wanted the sovereign state of Biafra, and from which some people broke off to form IPOB. There was also Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) in the West, and Arewa Peoples Congress up North. There was also the remnant of National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), which repudiated the 1999 Constitution, and vowed to write a new one for the country.\n\n\u201cAs the economic situation degenerates in the country, so does security degenerate,\u201d the Minister submitted, adding: \u201cThe situation now is not as uncontrollable as some people paint it. The current government is trying its best.\u201d Very courageous, if you ask me.\n\nNgige told his interviewer that he had been Governor, Senator, and now Minister since 2015, \u201cand I can safely tell you that we need an ad-hoc, mid-term, and long term funding plan for security.\u201d\n\nThen to the big elephant in the room. Secessionist agitation by IPOB and its military wing, the ESN. The Minister said he was sorry for them, particularly as someone who was a soldier, and saw action during the Nigeria/Biafra Civil War.\n\n\u201cWhen I see those gathering Ak-47 from slain policemen to fight a separatist war, I laugh. MASSOB was non-violent. IPOB also broke off from MASSOB and was non-violent initially. There\u2019s nothing wrong with referendum to determine where you want to be, as people would vote. But to want to use force, attack police stations, kill policemen, burn INEC facilities and correctional centers, you are only putting people in harm\u2019s way. It is not good.\n\n\u201cTerming everybody in South East as IPOB member is not good for investment and business. Before this government came in 2015, bomb explosions were going off everywhere, including in Abuja. Boko Haram was everywhere, before they were chased out and confined to the North East. The government has done so well.\u201d\n\nThe question was then asked whether the Igbo were truly marginalized in terms of political and economic power. The Minister paused, and said it was a tricky situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve noted the way appointments go, especially in the security services. There are some positions you must fill based on seniority, competence, and loyalty to the Commander-in-Chief. I\u2019ve discussed this one-on-one with Mr President a couple of times. Seniority, loyalty and competence are very cardinal. But all these things can be discussed without necessarily taking up arms.\u201d\n\nThe question turned to whether the South East had been marginalized in terms of infrastructure, and you see Dr Ngige in his elements.\n\n\u201cNobody can say the South East has been shortchanged,\u201d he posits. \u201cIt\u2019s ignorance. What this government promised, it has fulfilled.\n\n\u201cWhen it got to office, several states were assisted to clear backlog of salaries. The South East was not left out. Policemen who served in Biafra, and who had been denied pensions got their entitlements. The Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, which had failed, and one lane had been turned to farmland, was rebuilt. A journey of three hours has now become 40 minutes.\n\n\u201cThe Enugu-Onitsha road, passing through Awka, not touched by many governments before now, is being done. So also Enugu-Amansea, into Oji River. Enugu-Abakaliki is completed. Owerri-Aba-Umuahia is being done. Okigwe-Awudi to Ugah is being done. So also Onitsha to Nnewi.\n\n\u201cThe Second Niger Bridge is the icing on the cake, costing N236 billion. That bridge will give economic life to the South East, South South, and part of North Central. It is about 53% done, and work is going on vigorously. Yet some people still say they are not remembered in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe zone has produced Senate President for eight years, produced Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, and Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Yet they say no appointments.\n\n\u201cEnugu Airport had the worst runway before. Today, it is now international in name and standard. Night landing is possible there now, and with the installed Instrument Landing Systems, planes can land there in the worst weather. And this was done by a President they say hates them.\u201d\n\nDr Ngige attributes the antipathy to the President and the All Progressives Congress in the zone to the propaganda of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cThe party had thought no one else could make inroad into the zone, till I broke the jinx in 2011: winning the Senate seat on the platform of the then Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), which they called a Yoruba party. It was the greatest fight of my political life.\u201d\n\nHe laments that separatist agitation became stronger in the region when APC began to govern two states, declaring: \u201cThere must be a limit to politicking\u2026some people don\u2019t know when they are crossing boundaries.\u201d\n\nDr Ngige describes President Buhari as a democrat, who is afraid of breaching the Constitution, adding that \u201che\u2019s a willing horse, and people want to ride him to death, which is not fair.\u201d\n\nTo another big one. Would the Minister subscribe to President of Igbo extraction in 2023?\n\nWhy not? He canvasses a return to the Sani Abacha 1995 Constitution that prescribes rotational presidency with single term of five years.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use it for 30 years, and the six zones would all have tasted the Presidency. We would heal all wounds, and have a more stable polity..\n\n\u201cBut I believe APC won\u2019t be unfair to the southern block of the party, which has three zones. We will sit down and discuss.\u201d\n\nIt is said that dynamite comes in small packages. That was what the Minister proved by that interview. A human dynamo, not afraid to voice his convictions.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "Pan Ocean Oil staff Onyegbula steals $340K from 17 U.S. States, awaits extradition",
          "text": "Chukwuemeka Onyegbula, an IT staff of Pan Ocean Oil Corporation Nigeria Limited, has been indicted in the U.S. State of Washington for wire fraud and identity theft.\n\nOnyegbula, who was arrested on 5 June in Lagos, is awaiting extradition to the United States to face trial.\n\nAuthorities said he and his co-conspirators filed false claims for pandemic-related unemployment benefits in 17 states.\n\nOnyegbula, who uses the name \u201cPhillip Carter,\u201d was linked to at least 253 fraudulent filings for unemployment benefits, according to an indictment unsealed Thursday in Seattle.\n\nAccording to the Seattle U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Washington, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin paid out a total of nearly $290,000 on claims related to the case.\n\nAdditionally, the federal Small Business Administration paid out $54,000 in COVID-19 economic disaster claims filed by Onyegbula and his co-conspirators, prosecutors said.\n\nOnyegbula is the second Nigerian national charged with such fraud in U.S. District Court for western Washington.\n\nAbidemi Rufai, 42, a suspended Ogun state government official, has been accused of filing $350,000 in fraudulent claims in Washington and other states, with $288,000 making it into a bank account he controlled.\n\nHe also sought to bilk the Internal Revenue Service of nearly $1.6 million, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nRufai was arrested May 14 as he tried to travel from New York to Nigeria. A federal court in New York ordered him released on bond pending trial, but federal prosecutors in western Washington have been seeking to make sure he remains in custody, saying he poses a severe flight risk, is facile with fake identities, and that he\u00b4s unlikely to ever be extradited if he makes it back to Nigeria.\n\nA hearing is set for Friday to determine whether Rufai might be released pending trial.\n\nIn a court filing Wednesday, assistant U.S. attorneys said that a recorded conversation between Rufai and his brother revealed that Rufai did not really know a woman who had offered to act as his custodian should he be released.\n\nThe recorded conversation also suggested that Rufai had significantly more money than he led the court to believe, prosecutors said.\n\nIn a response filed Thursday, one of Rufai\u2019s attorneys, Michael C. Barrows, called the government\u2019s reading of the conversation \u201can absolute fabrication.\u201d\n\nThe family friend who offered to act as custodian attended the christening of Rufai\u2019s son five years ago, Barrows said. Rufai often visited her when he traveled to New York, and nothing in the conversation \u2013 which occurred in English, Rufai\u2019s second language \u2013 could be understood to mean he didn\u2019t know her, Barrows said.\n\nFurther, the comments Rufai made about money referenced the fact that he could raise funds for his bond from friends and supporters \u2013 not that he had hidden assets, Barrows said.\n\nWashington state was severely victimised by fraudulent claims for pandemic-related benefits.\n\nIt likely paid out more than $647 million in such fraudulent claims, though $370 million was recovered, according to state officials.\n\nModus Operandi:\n\nPaul Roberts of Seattle Times wrote that the method used by Onyegbula and Rufai to bilk the states are identical.\n\nLike Rufai, Onyegbula used a feature of Gmail, Google\u2019s free email service, to file multiple claims for benefits with the Washington state Employment Security Department and other states, according to the indictment.\n\nHolders of a single Gmail account can create dozens of additional email addresses simply by adding one or more periods to the original address. Because the Gmail system doesn\u2019t recognize periods, any emails sent to those so-called dot variant addresses are all routed to the inbox of the original Gmail address.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Onyegbula and unnamed co-conspirators used his original Gmail address, [email protected], to create dozens of variants such as [email protected]\n\nOnyegbula and co-conspirators used the email addresses along with stolen Social Security numbers and other personal data to file at least 253 unemployment claims with the ESD and unemployment agencies in Arizona, California and 14 other states, prosecutors say.\n\nAt least $289,604 in benefits were paid out on those claims, according to a June 7 complaint.\n\nOnyegbula and co-conspirators used a similar approach in filing at least 63 applications for so-called Economic Injury Disaster Loans through the federal Small Business Administration, according to the complaint. Those applications netted Onyegbula and his co-conspirators at least $53,900, prosecutors say.\n\nThe status of the stolen funds remains under investigation, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nInvestigators said they also found indications that the [email protected] account was used to seek fraudulent tax refunds. That\u2019s potentially another parallel with Rufai, who also attempted to defraud the Internal Revenue Service of nearly $1.6 million, according to a May 28 federal filing.\n\nBut as with Rufai\u2019s case, Onyegbula\u2019s Gmail account also appears to have helped federal investigators track him down.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the Gmail account contained information about a bank account in Onyegbula\u2019s name, his U.S. visa application, and a work email from a Nigerian-based oil company, Pan Ocean Oil Corporation Nigeria Limited.\n\nA LinkedIn profile lists an individual named Chukwuemeka Onyegbula as a \u201csystem engineer at Pan Ocean Oil Corporation,\u201d and as a 2005 graduate in computer engineering from the University of Benin.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General and the Department of Justice and the cooperation of the ESD.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Lucky Irabor has met with retired senior military officers in the South-west to discuss way out of the current security challenges in the country.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the meeting Thursday at the headquarters of 2nd Division Nigerian Army Ibadan, Irabor said it was part of efforts at tracing the root causes of security challenges in the country.\n\nHe said the meeting was to tap from the wealth of experience and knowledge of the retired officers and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWhatever experience and solutions gathered from the meeting will help in tackling various security challenges in Nigeria. With your wealth of experience and knowledge acquired over the years, we believe there is no better cross-section of Nigerians that should better be engaged than you.\n\n\u201cYou are most qualified and knowledgeable on issues of security and because of this, we have brought you here. You know security issues in your neighbourhood,\u201d Irabor said.\n\nThe CDS tasked the participants to be sincere, forthcoming and open during the meeting, urging them to be committed to the unity, peace and progress of the country.\n\nIrabor said the armed forces would leverage the wealth of experience of the retired officers for the betterment of the region and Nigeria in general.\n\nThe CDS said the military had been re-assessing its operational engagements on daily basis to improve the security of the country.\n\nAlso addressing the participants, the Chief of Defence Military Cooperation (CDCMIC), Rear Admiral Fredrick Ogu said the meeting was expected to bring some salient issues to the attention of the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) and also proffer solutions.\n\nHe said the South-west interactive meeting was being held in Ibadan in view of the cosmopolitan nature of the city and Lagos, both experiencing series of emerging security threats.\n\nOgu said the participants would deliberate on the various security challenges confronting the South-west.\n\nThe CDCMIC further disclosed that the security parley would be replicated in the other five geo-political zones at selected state capitals and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.\n\nIn his remarks, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 2 Division Nigerian Army, Major-General Gold Chibuisi, appreciated the CDS for trying to tap from the experience of the retired senior officers.\n\nChibuisi said they had a critical role to play in assisting the nation to tackle the security challenges in Southwest and Nigeria in general.\n\nOsinbajo reassures\n\nAnd from Vice President Yemi Osinbajo came the reassurance that the security challenges facing the country would soon be a thing of the past.\n\nTo this end, he said the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly was to enhance the capacity of the military and other security agencies as major effort towards beefing up the federal government\u2019s response to the menace.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity (Office of the Vice President) Laolu Akande in a statement Thursday quoted Vice President Osinbajo as saying this Wednesday evening when he received in audience His Royal Majesty Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti Oba Adeola Adeniyi Ajakaiye at the Presidential Villa Abuja.\n\nIn attendance were Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment Otunba Niyi Adebayo and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele among others.\n\nVice President further stated that traditional rulers, local and state governments must also collaborate with the federal government in tackling insecurity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe President has recently constituted a committee that will look at the whole security infrastructure with a view to looking at the needs of the military, as well as the police and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose of that bill is to present some of the needs of the military, as well as of security agencies in order to be able to beef up our response to the security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep looking at how to support our (security) services to ensure that our country is safe. I can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past, and that we will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said much as the federal government was concerned to improve security nationwide, community effort was also vital in tackling the issue from the roots.\n\n\u201cThere is no question at all that, at the level of community, we need to take decisive action, because most of these things occur in our community level.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m very happy to hear that you have a committee organised for the purpose of this (tackling insecurity) and that you\u2019ve been able to contain the menace that we see in different parts of the country in your community.\n\n\u201cAny country with this number of security challenges must respond as robustly as possible. But it is also important to bear in mind that it takes a combined effort of all of us, at the local government level, state and federal levels; all of the levels; we need to come together to tackle this issue of insecurity,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOsinbajo also said the federal government would provide necessary support to the community in tackling its challenges, adding the government was working with the Ekiti state government on dealing with insecurity, as well as various issues.\n\nIn his remarks, the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Adeniyi Ajakaiye, thanked the VP for granting them audience and listening to their demands, including support for the establishment of a Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in the community.\n\n\u201cAgain, as a community, we have come to appreciate you (Vice President) for your diligence, hard work, commitment and loyalty; and that, we from the South West, are very proud of you. We want to assure you that we are very much in support of you. From our own end, we are doing a lot to ensure that the menace of insecurity will not remain in our domain,\u201d Oba Ajakaiye said.",

          "text": "Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has stated that it is deploying 5, 346 staff for the Continous Voter Registration, CVR exercise, schedule to commence on the 28th of June, 2021, in 2,673 registration centres nationwide.\n\nChairman of the Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, made the disclosure today, during a press conference and the launching of the online registration portal for the resumption of the CVR at the INEC headquarters Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the Register of Voters is at the heart of democratic elections and that a good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. Stating that, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\n\nIn his words; \u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device, IVED. This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM).\n\n\u201cIn our determination serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards, PVCs online.\n\n\u201cWe hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience. The portal will go live in the early hours of Monday 28th June 2021. However, I must quickly reiterate that the online registration is a public service and therefore free of charge. There is no INEC-approved cybercafe, no online registration centre and no scratch card to be purchased for the exercise. All you need is a device, including your mobile phones that can connect to the internet. Citizens can complete the online pre-registration anywhere and at anytime they choose. Just follow the simple but detailed step-by-step procedure on the portal and contact the INEC Help Desk where necessary. The details are on our website,\u201d he added.\n\nThe exercise according to Prof. Yakubu, is meant for the following categories of Nigerians; Those who are 18 years and above and have not registered previously; Registered voters who have had any problem during accreditation for any past election, with either their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards or their fingerprints not being read by the Smart Card Reader; Registered voters who want to transfer their voting location from one place to another. Registered voters who want to correct issues with their data, such as misspelt names, dates of birth, etc. And registered voters whose PVCs are lost or damaged.",

Godswill Akpabio, has reiterated that President Muhammadu Buhari is determined to change the story of the Niger Delta region, from having to bear decades of decay in infrastructures, to that of access to services and infrastructural development.\n\nAkpabio gave this assurance when he met with the Charge \u2018d\u2019 Affaires of the Embassy of Ireland to Nigeria, Mr. Conor Finn and his team who paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nThe minister noted that the people of the Niger Delta region have had to bear with strive violence and deprivation since 1956 when oil was first discovered in Oloibiri Bayelsa State.\n\nThe former Akwa Ibom Governor added that pollution in most areas is so serious that it destroys aquatic life, which should be a source of livelihood for the people, noting that what led to militancy was the attitude and method of operations adopted by the International Oil Companies, IOCs.\n\n\u201cThe present administration even when working under very difficult circumstances is doing everything to alleviate the peoples suffering and the first thing that must change is the attitude, not just of the IOC\u2019S, but also of the people because they are part of the problem. So there must be a change of attitude from that of receiving tokenism to that of insisting on access to development and services,\u201d Akpabio said.\n\nEarlier, Permanent Secretary of the Niger Delta ministry, Dr. Babayo Ardo said \u201cwe are working together to actualize all the deliverables particularly in the areas of women empowerment initiatives, skill acquisition by youths to provide basic skills and means of livelihood for that segment of the population. The completion of 346km East-West Road is our priority and other projects that have been completed are slated for commissioning soon\u201d.\n\nIn his response, the Irish Envoy to Nigeria commended the minister and his team for the ongoing efforts at repositioning the Niger Delta and curbing extremism within the region.\n\nHe assured that the Irish government will continue to partner with the ministry to provide sustainable development for the region and the country as a whole, stressing the need to improve services and infrastructure.\n\nReaffirming the Irish partnership, Reverend Father Kevin O\u2019 Hara said he has great hope in the minister, having seen what he did in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nHe further sought for areas that the Irish government can key in to help the region to make a difference.",

When the youth started the #EndSARS protest, Mr President supported the genuine agitation and approved the demand of the youths by disbanding SARS immediately until anarchists took over the situation and began to cause destruction.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on all youths to support President Buhari who has shown uncommon love for the youth. The President swiftly disbanded SARS when the youths took to the streets to protest. Truly President Buhari ended SARS before anarchy took over the movement. We are at a critical moment in our national life and as youth we must not be part of those who seek to cripple the country. The youths should rather rise to the occasion and join hands with the government to redirect the Nigerian State on the path of productivity in line with the steadfast vision of Mr. President. The President has firm confidence in the youth and believes lasting legacies can be built in partnership with the youth, we must not betray the President by pitching tent with anarchists and scessionists who want to destroy the country\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nThe statement further noted that as the umbrella body of youth organisations, it would gather youths from all works of life on 1st of July to discuss the imperative of a peaceful Nigeria.\n\nNYCN while commending the media for its role in uniting the nation, dismissed calls calling for scrapping of the NYSC scheme.",

Its need would be better served through strengthening its Information Technology capability as\n\ncurrently being done by the FCTA\u201d.\n\nThe Minister however commended the Senate on the move to give the FCT College of Nursing and Midwifery , required legal instrument .\n\n\u201d Generally , we have carefully perused the entire bill and find it appropriate\u201d , he said .\n\nSeveral other stakeholders in the Federal Capital Territory , made presentations on the proposed bills, which the Chairman of the Committee , Senator Abubakar Kyari ( APC Borno North), said would be fully reflected in reports to be submitted to the Senate later .",

          "text": "The police have arrested a university student accused of killing Usifo Ataga, the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV.\n\nAtaga was said to have been found in a pool of his blood with multiple wounds on his body after the media mogul was stabbed to death at a hotel where he reportedly lodges in the Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nChidinma Ojukwu, a 300-level Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), was paraded on Thursday at the Lagos State Police Command headquarters in Ikeja.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police in the state, Hakeem Odumosu, told reporters at the briefing that the suspect had confessed that she stabbed Ataga.\n\nHe disclosed that the owner of the rented apartment where the tragic incident occurred has been arrested and held in police detention.\n\nOdumosu added that Ataga\u2019s bank account has been blocked in a bid to prevent further withdrawals by those taking advantage of his untimely death.\n\nDuring a session with reporters, 21-year-old Chidinma gave an account of what transpired between her and the late businessman whom she accused of raping her.\n\nShe claimed that Ataga made a first attempt which was successful, noting that the unfortunate incident took place after she resisted a second attempt.\n\n\u201cWe were in the lodge smoking. He was trying to make advances on me. I was tired and he became violent on it. I let him have his way.\n\n\u201cTowards afternoon, he ordered roofies. We took it together and ate food. He became high. I was still not happy with the first one (sex) that we had, so, I was staying on my own, smoking and drinking. He, too, was on his own. He came to me, and I told him I wasn\u2019t happy with what he did,\u201d the suspect recounted.\n\nShe added, \u201cHe was like, \u2018Take my ATM and withdraw what you want\u2019. He later became violent trying to get to me and I was resisting and defending myself. At some point, he hit my head on the wall and I also retaliated.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chidinma, Ataga began to chase her at some point in the kitchen where she took a knife and stabbed him in the neck.\n\nShe explained that the media mogul followed her as she approached the door before she stabbed him twice on the neck side again.\n\n\u201cI threw the knife to the bed, and he was going for it, but I also went for it. He dragged the knife with me and it broke, and he fell on the floor,\u201d she narrated.",

          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has explained why it is important for the Nigerian government to continue to borrow responsibly to fund critical projects in the country.\n\nHe believes it is not feasible for the government to tax the people further in the face of the present economic situation and the nation\u2019s infrastructure must be developed.\n\nThe Senate President made the remarks on Thursday while briefing State House correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cYou cannot, in my view and judgement, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructural development; other countries do that, but we have serious situation across the country.\n\nSo, you cannot put taxes on the people. The only option left is for use to borrow responsibly, utilise prudently and economically, and ensure that the projects are self-sustaining; that they can pay back the loans,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Lawan added, \u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we do not have the necessary revenue; Nigeria is poor, we should not deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have.\n\n\u201cOur resources are so low, our revenues are so low; therefore, the option of not doing anything just to sit (because we have no money, we should not go for infrastructure development) is not an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\u201d\n\nInvestors Not Willing\n\nHe gave the assurance that the National Assembly would give legislative approval to the Executive loan request to fund the 2021 Appropriation Act before it embarked on a recess in July.\n\nThe lawmaker reiterated that the 2021 Supplementary Bill would also go through final consideration before the recess to fast-track the government\u2019s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and military hardware to tackle insecurity.\n\nWhile stressing the need to borrow funds, he stated that the Legislature would not just support or approve loans for the executive.\n\nThe Senate President noted that this would be done only after investigating the implementation of such loans through oversight functions to ensure that they were directly deployed for intended projects.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has no other choice than to borrow money and the option of private-public partnerships and Internally Generation Revenue (IGR) was not worthy of consideration.\n\nSenator Lawan said, \u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the Executive arm of government; whenever we have to approve any loan, we will insist on the details of the funding to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans and they must be favourable conditions before we approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other option is probably private partnership \u2013 you need to create the environment to attract investors to come into your country. Because of the security challenges we face today, not many investors would like to come to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even those inside Nigeria may not like to invest properly in the sector of infrastructure development,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The head of the British Olympic Association (BOA) says the organisation is still \u201ctrying to convince\u201d some athletes to have the Covid vaccine before Tokyo 2020 starts next month.\n\nChief executive Andy Anson said \u201cwell over 90%\u201d of British athletes will have two vaccine doses by the Olympics. But he also admitted \u201cthere are individuals who didn\u2019t want to be vaccinated\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to convince them it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPeople have got the right to choose, and we have to respect that. But it\u2019s not necessarily that helpful.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging and exclusive interview with The Sports Desk podcast, Anson said the BOA had been running a \u201cmammoth programme of vaccination of the whole entourage, well over 1,000 people\u2026 because that will lessen the risk\u201d, but there had been challenges.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some difficulties with some athletes who have been travelling around the continent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that nearly everyone will have at least one dose. We\u2019ll keep trying right until the last minute.\u201d\n\nThe Olympics were postponed for the first time in their history in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and are set to go ahead on 23 July, despite significant opposition from the public and medical experts in Japan.\n\nOrganisers insist they will be safe and secure, but the vaccination roll-out has been slow.\n\nCoronavirus case numbers have been falling since May, when there were more than 6,000 a day across Japan, and a state of emergency in Tokyo has been lifted.\n\nIn the host city, experts have said the daily infection rate should be below 100 in order to hold the Games safely.\n\nHowever, the city\u2019s health authorities reported 619 new infections on 23 June, and the average for the last seven days is 423 new cases a day.\n\nThe BOA is sending a team of more than 370 athletes to the event.\n\nAnson said the 18,000-bed athletes\u2019 village in Tokyo will be \u201cprobably the toughest environment in sports at this time\u201d.\n\n\u201cEleven thousand athletes basically sharing one dining hall, that\u2019s the challenge.\n\n\u201cSo we are putting in place very strict protocols along with the organisers to make sure, to the fullest extent possible, we follow the rules of isolation, distancing, and just keeping in our own \u2018semi bubbles\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe will eat together \u2013 we won\u2019t be mixing in the village like people normally would. So that\u2019s the tough bit. But we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve got enough people around from a medical perspective to make sure that environment is as safe as it possibly can be.\u201d\n\nThis week two Ugandan athletes tested positive after arriving in Japan despite being fully vaccinated.\n\nWhen asked if he feared similar cases involving British athletes, Anson said: \u201cI\u2019d be a little naive if I said there weren\u2019t going to be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to plan that there will be cases\u2026 we anticipate that and when there are cases, we manage them properly.\n\n\u201cBut clearly there is that risk that people test positive.\n\n\u201cBeing vaccinated gives you a chance to get out of any quarantine environments earlier.\n\n\u201cI think we all know that this pandemic is a very difficult thing to manage.\u201d\n\nAthletes suspected of having Covid will be sent to the village\u2019s \u2018fever clinic\u2019, and could be moved to an \u2018isolation hotel\u2019 if a positive case is confirmed, ruling them out of their events.\n\n\u201cThe athletes are very aware of the risks, because they\u2019ve been competing and some have seen colleagues miss competition,\u201d said Anson.\n\n\u201cWe have some brilliant people who are very focused on mental health and wellbeing. But it won\u2019t be easy if it happens.\u201d\n\nAnson confirmed that Team GB athletes would not need to quarantine for six days on arrival in Japan after the UK was added to to Japan\u2019s travel \u2018red list\u2019 because of rising cases of the Delta variant.\n\n\u201cWe got in contact with the IOC and said that would be completely unfair. And they acknowledged that straight away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey came up with this plan for Team GB, where for three days after arrival we won\u2019t be able to train or mix with athletes from other nations. But that\u2019s fine, because the vast majority of our athletes are going to the preparation camp which is our own environment.\u201d\n\nDespite the restrictions, Anson believes athletes will still be able to enjoy the Olympics.\n\n\u201cOne of the messages that came to us very early on from the athletes was, \u2018please don\u2019t make this the Covid Games for us. We want to see this as the Olympic Games. It\u2019s our chance to shine.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo we as an organisation are obsessing about the impact of Covid. We\u2019re trying to take all of that weight off the athletes\u2019 shoulders so they can go out there and compete and enjoy it without worrying about all this other stuff. So I think they can be fun.\n\n\u201cThere are some sad things \u2013 the fact the athletes have to leave the village within two days of competing and then come home means they won\u2019t be able to watch their fellow athletes.\n\n\u201cFriends and family were the one group we were trying to push back on to see if they would be allowed in the country. But the Japanese government, rightly probably, took the decision there were no international visitors.\n\n\u201cSo that is a shame, but we will make it as positive an environment as possible.\u201d\n\nDespite fears the Games may trigger a surge in coronavirus infections, up to 10,000 Japanese fans will be permitted at venues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bigger and better than the Olympics for uniting the whole world. Yes, it\u2019s going to be tough, and different,\u201d said Anson.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m absolutely convinced it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the chance to lift the whole country and actually the world, and it could be an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nAnson admitted that cancellation of the Games would have meant a \u201cvery difficult situation for the BOA\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd that would have been replicated all around the world, not just for national Olympic committees, but for international federations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been about greed. It\u2019s been about the financial sustainability of the whole sporting landscape.\u201d",

          "text": "At least one person has died and dozens are missing after the collapse of a 12-storey residential building north of Miami, Florida, officials say.\n\nThe number of people who have been located now stands at 102, while 99 are still unaccounted for, according to Miami-Dade Mayor Danielle Levine-Cava.\n\nIt is unclear how many people were in the building at the time.\n\nThe cause of the collapse \u2013 affecting about half of the 130 units in the complex \u2013 remains unclear. The block in the town of Surfside was built in 1980.\n\nA number of Latin American migrants have been reported missing by their consulates.\n\nRelatives of the first lady of Paraguay are also among the missing, Paraguayan officials said.\n\nRescuers were unable to contact the sister and brother-in-law of first lady Silvana L\u00f3pez Moreira, along with their three children and a domestic worker.\n\nRescuers pulled 35 people from the wreckage, officials said. Ten were assessed and treated, of whom two were sent to hospital.\n\nSearch and rescue teams are working from a parking garage underneath the wreckage as they explore the rubble for survivors.\n\nA small fire broke out during the search but was extinguished within 20 minutes, said Miami-Dade fire chief Raide Jadallah.\n\nHe said they had been using sonar and search cameras as well as specially trained dogs, but it was a \u201cslow and methodical\u201d process because of the risk of shifting rubble.\n\n\u201cThe back of the building, probably a third or more, is totally pancaked,\u201d Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told a news conference.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis, who visited the site on Thursday afternoon, said the fire and rescue service was still in \u201csearch and rescue mode\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe TV doesn\u2019t do it justice. It is really, really traumatic to see the collapse of a massive structure like that,\u201d he said.\n\nRelatives of the missing have been huddled around a community centre a few blocks from the collapsed building, waiting for information and fearing the worst.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he was waiting for Mr DeSantis to declare an emergency and officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) were already at the scene.\n\n\u201cI say to the people of Florida, whatever help you want, what the federal government can provide, we\u2019re waiting, just ask us. We\u2019ll be there,\u201d Mr Biden said.\n\nPolice gave the building\u2019s location as 8777 Collins Avenue, the address of the 12-storey Champlain Towers. The city of Surfside runs along Collins Avenue, north of Miami Beach city limits.\n\nRescuers could be seen using a crane to reach residents in nearby apartments in order to help them evacuate.\n\nOne man who was out with his brothers walking their dog described hearing the building come down.\n\n\u201cBasically we heard a really big rumble and we thought it was a motorcycle, you know, and we turned around and saw a cloud of dust just coming our way,\u201d he told CBS Miami.\n\n\u201cWe were like \u2013 \u2018what is going on?\u2019 We went rushing toward it with shirts over our faces and the security guard came out and we were, like, \u2018what happened?\u2019 and she said the building collapsed.\u201d\n\nA man who witnessed the aftermath of the collapse told CNN, \u201cIt looked like something from 9/11,\u201d referring to the attacks that brought down the Twin Towers in New York in 2001.\n\nSanto Mejil, 50, was woken when his wife called from a unit on the ninth floor of one of the three buildings that make up Champlain Towers. She is an overnight caretaker for an elderly disabled woman.\n\n\u201cShe said she heard a big explosion,\u201d Mr Mejil told the Miami Herald. \u201cIt felt like an earthquake.\u201d His wife was among those rescued.\n\nA man who lives in a neighbouring building described what happened for CBS: \u201cThe building shook and then I looked out the window and you couldn\u2019t see, I thought it was like a storm or something coming in.\n\n\u201cWhen the dust cleared, the back two-thirds of the building was gone, it was down to the ground.\u201d",

          "title": "UK, Russia Escalate War of Words over Black Sea Warship Incident",
          "text": "A war of words between Moscow and London escalated on Thursday as both sides accused one another of giving inaccurate accounts of an incident involving a British warship and Russian forces in the Black Sea.\n\nRussia said it fired warning shots and dropped bombs in the path of HMS Defender on Wednesday as it sailed off the coast of the Crimea peninsula, accusing the Royal Navy destroyer of breaching its territorial waters.\n\nThe United Kingdom disputed Russia\u2019s account, saying no warning shots were fired and no bombs were dropped, but suggested a Russian gunnery exercise had been taking place in the area.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters on Thursday HMS Defender was acting legally in international waters and described the vessel\u2019s route as \u201cwholly appropriate\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe important point is that we don\u2019t recognise the Russian annexation of Crimea,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are Ukrainian waters and it was entirely right to use them to go from A to B.\u201d\n\nRussia annexed Crimea in 2014 and Moscow considers areas around the Crimean peninsula\u2019s coast to be Russian waters.\n\nBut Western countries deem Crimea to be part of Ukraine and reject Russia\u2019s claim to the seas around it.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also denounced Moscow on Thurdsay.\n\n\u201cNo shots were fired at HMS Defender,\u201d Raab told reporters in Singapore, during a visit to discuss trade deals.\n\n\u201cThe Royal Navy ship was conducting innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters. We were doing so in accordance with international law and the Russian characterisation is predictably inaccurate.\u201d\n\nUnder international law of the sea, \u201cinnocent passage\u201d permits a vessel to pass through another state\u2019s territorial waters so long as this does not affect its security.\n\nMeanwhile, in comments broadcast on state television, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused the UK of telling \u201cbarefaced lies\u201d regarding its account of events.\n\nThe ministry summoned UK Ambassador Deborah Bronnert on Thursday to deliver a \u201ctough demarche\u201d \u2013 diplomatic jargon for a telling off \u2013 over the episode, which the Kremlin described as a \u201cprovocation\u201d.\n\nThe UK government said it would not accept unlawful interference with the principle of innocent passage following the incident, which officials said took place as HMS Defender was travelling on an internationally recognised route from Odessa, Ukraine, to Georgia.\n\nHowever, Russia said HMS Defender had ventured as far as three kilometres (two miles) into Russian waters near Cape Fiolent.\n\nThe promontory is a landmark on Crimea\u2019s southern coast and lies near the port of Sevastopol, headquarters of the Russian Navy\u2019s Black Sea fleet.\n\nDescribing events on Wednesday, Russia\u2019s defence ministry claimed that a border patrol ship fired warning shots while an Su-24 jet dropped four bombs in HMS Defender\u2019s path, prompting the vessel to turn around.\n\nRussia\u2019s deputy foreign minister warned on Thursday that Moscow would always \u201cstand guard\u201d over its borders and was entitled to \u201cbomb\u201d in instances where they are ignored.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do? We can appeal to common sense, demand respect for international law. If this does not help, we can bomb not only in the direction, but also on target, if our colleagues do not understand,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Russia\u2019s Tass news agency.\n\n\u201cI warn everyone violating the state borders of the Russian Federation under the slogan of free navigation, from such provocative steps, because the security of our country comes first.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe territorial integrity of the Russian Federation is inviolable. The inviolability of its borders is an absolute imperative, we will stand guard over all this by diplomatic, political and, if necessary, military means.\u201d\n\nRyabkov\u2019s remarks came as Moscow released footage filmed from a Russian Su-24 bomber flying close to HMS Defender.\n\nThe UK\u2019s BBC news, whose reporter Jonathan Beale was on deck during the incident, meanwhile published video from the British ship showing a Russian officer warning that he would shoot if it did not change course.\n\nIn that BBC video, after the Russian warning issued over radio, Beale is heard saying: \u201cShots are fired, but they are well out of range\u201d.\n\nThe BBC said as many as 20 Russian aircraft were also buzzing the British warship.",

          "title": "US Seizure of Iran-linked Websites \u2018Shortsighted\u2019, Analysts Say",
          "text": "Just like its abandonment of Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal, another unilateral move by the United States once more promises to affect life in Iran for the worse, this time in terms of internet freedom, analysts say.\n\nIn a surprise move on Wednesday, the US Justice Department seized 36 websites with links to the Iranian state for engaging in \u201cdisinformation campaigns and malign influence operations\u201d.\n\nThe move initially arose suspicions of a hack since a disclaimer that said \u201cthis website has been seized\u201d accompanied an Arabic text instead of Farsi, and State Department spokesman Ned Price refused to comment, indicating that US officials working on Iran were likely not in the loop.\n\nThe seizures come as Iran and world powers \u2013 including the US \u2013 are soon expected to start a seventh and perhaps final round of negotiations in Vienna to restore the 2015 nuclear deal that the US abandoned in 2018.\n\nThe sanctions that the US has since imposed have been the harshest Iran has ever faced, and have led to rampant inflation and unemployment amid the deadliest COVID-19 pandemic of the Middle East.\n\nThe Justice Department eventually said three of the seized domains belonged to Iraqi group Kataeb Hezbollah, while the rest, including Yemeni, Palestinian, and Bahraini outlets in English and Arabic, were held by the Iranian Islamic Radio and Television Union, reportedly run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 foreign-looking Quds Force.\n\nThe seized websites belonged to outlets of the so-called \u201cresistance axis\u201d that Iran supports across the region to counter the influence of the US and regional rivals like Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe US blacklisted them with designations related to \u201cterrorism\u201d, and said American companies are not allowed to provide them with .com and .net domains without special authorisation from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nThe move drew swift criticism from Iranian officials and restricted outlets, chief among them Press TV, the Iranian state-run television\u2019s main English broadcasting channel.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry called the seizure an example of a \u201csystematic effort to distort freedom of speech on a global level and silence independent voices in media\u201d, adding that Iran will pursue the issue through legal channels.\n\nWhile the US may have given itself the ability to exert influence over vast sections of the internet, its actions could have far-reaching ramifications beyond its control.\n\nObservers fear the seizures will only strengthen arguments in favour of the so-called National Information Network (NIN), a massive internet nationalisation initiative in Iran.\n\nThere is precedent for it, after all.\n\nForeign governments have no right to spread disinformation inside the United States, obviously. But US citizens and residents have a constitutionally protected right to receive information from abroad. Not clear that this right has been given appropriate weight here.\n\nIn January 2020, when the news was still dominated by the consequences of the US drone assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani, and the IRGC firing of missiles at the US bases and its shooting down of a passenger plane, the hardline Fars News Agency\u2019s .com domain was blocked.\n\nShortly after, the Donald Trump administration also seized the website of the IRAN daily newspaper and several other affiliated outlets.\n\nThis was followed months later by the seizure of two websites utilised by Kataeb Hezbollah, and 92 domain names \u201cunlawfully used by Iran\u2019s IRGC to engage in a global disinformation campaign\u201d.\n\nThose incidents gave credence to arguments of US interference and censoring used by Iranian officials to convince the public and push ahead with the NIN, which has been in the works for more than 10 years.\n\nSadjad Bonabi, an infrastructure development official with the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, said in January 2020 that the infrastructures provided by the NIN have \u201calleviated many of the concerns from cruel sanctions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are excuses Iranian authorities \u2013 regardless of whether they come from the hardline factions or are part of President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s moderate government \u2013 use to justify the need to strengthen the nationalisation of the Iranian Internet inwards in the NIN project,\u201d Mahsa Alimardani, a researcher with British human rights organisation ARTICLE19, told Al Jazeera.\n\nBut while the NIN can have positive effects, like easing access to online services, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, some Iranians are concerned about its potential use in restricting internet access.\n\nThose concerns were proven true in November 2019 when, amid nationwide protests that were sparked by an overnight tripling of fuel costs, the state almost completely shut off global internet access for a week \u2013 longer in several cities \u2013 and began a crackdown that rights groups say killed hundreds of people. Only some local internet services were accessible through the NIN during that time.\n\nMoreover, officials including President-elect Ebrahim Raisi, have talked about a layered internet access model and \u201clegal VPNs\u201d (virtual private networks) that would provide different levels of internet access to people based on profession among other things.\n\nMeanwhile, the US may not stand to gain much in the long term by blacklisting domains linked with Iran, especially as they will not be taken offline.\n\nPressTV, for instance, switched to a .ir domain immediately after having its .com address seized. The same was true with Fars when its website was seized last year.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s seizures, Iran\u2019s ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi promised his ministry will provide the \u201cnecessary infrastructures\u201d to the seized outlets.\n\nThe language US officials used in their announcement on the seizures suggests the Iranian outlets were also targeted for trying to influence the 2020 presidential elections, something ARTICLE19\u2019s Alimardani finds strange.\n\n\u201cThis in itself is a strange excuse for sanctioning these entities, given these outlets are considered \u2018white propaganda\u2019 outlets and not agents of \u2018influence operations\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said while the US may have caused some inconvenience for the outlets, including by hurting their branding efforts and Google search results, its move was \u201cshortsighted\u201d as it lent support to their argument that the US is an imperial and bullying power.\n\n\u201cAmerica further diminishes its standing and efforts as a promoter of \u2018internet freedom\u2019 with these efforts,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhile not directly kicking off innocent Iranian civilian users in this case, the move is indirectly pushing Iranian policy towards more nationalisation and promotion of .ir domains for websites hosted by ordinary Iranians.\u201d\n\nSanctions expert Brian O\u2019Toole told Al Jazeera the \u201cterrorism\u201d designation provides the US Department of Justice with legal grounds to take such actions.\n\n\u201cHowever, even if DOJ has grounds legally for seizing these Iranian websites, it\u2019s hard to understand how this would be a deterrent in the future or have material impact to these news outlets,\u201d said the former OFAC adviser who is now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cInstead, I worry that the action comes across as overly heavy-handed and will engender criticism of the United States for cracking down on \u2018speech\u2019, all while having little to no effect in thwarting terrorism [or electoral interference].\u201d",
          "summary": "In a surprise move on Wednesday, the US Justice Department seized 36 websites with links to the Iranian state for engaging in \u201cdisinformation campaigns and malign influence operations\u201d.\nThe seized websites belonged to outlets of the so-called \u201cresistance axis\u201d that Iran supports across the region to counter the influence of the US and regional rivals like Israel and Saudi Arabia.\nThe move drew swift criticism from Iranian officials and restricted outlets, chief among them Press TV, the Iranian state-run television\u2019s main English broadcasting channel.\nShortly after, the Donald Trump administration also seized the website of the IRAN daily newspaper and several other affiliated outlets.\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s seizures, Iran\u2019s ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi promised his ministry will provide the \u201cnecessary infrastructures\u201d to the seized outlets.",

          "text": "An indigenous nation in Canada says it has found 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former residential school in Saskatchewan.\n\nThe Cowessess First Nation said the discovery was \u201cthe most significantly substantial to date in Canada\u201d.\n\nIt comes weeks after the remains of 215 children were found at a similar residential school in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cThis is not a mass grave site. These are unmarked graves,\u201d said Cowessess Chief Cadmus Delorme.\n\nThe Marieval Indian Residential School was operated by the Roman Catholic Church from 1899 to 1997 in the area where Cowessess is now located in southeastern Saskatchewan. It is not yet clear if all of the remains are linked to the school.\n\nIt was one of more than 130 compulsory boarding schools funded by the Canadian government and run by religious authorities during the 19th and 20th Centuries with the aim of assimilating indigenous youth.\n\nAn estimated 6,000 children died while attending these schools, due in large part to the squalid health conditions inside. Students were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated, and unsanitary facilities.\n\nLast month, the Cowessess began to use ground-penetrating radar to locate unmarked graves at the cemetery of the Marieval Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan. Thursday\u2019s announcement marked the first phase of the search efforts.\n\nChief Delorme said there may have been markers for the graves at one point but that the Roman Catholic church, which oversaw the cemetery, may have removed them. Cowessess First Nation is \u201coptimistic\u201d that the church will work with them in investigating further, he said.\n\nIt has not yet been determined if all the unmarked graves belong to children, Chief Delorme said. Technical teams will now work to provide a verified number and identify the remains, he said.\n\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \u201cterribly saddened\u201d by the discovery in Saskatchewan. He said it was \u201ca shameful reminder of the systemic racism, discrimination, and injustice that Indigenous peoples have faced\u201d.\n\nBetween 1863 and 1998, more than 150,000 indigenous children were taken from their families and placed in these schools throughout Canada.\n\nThe children were often not allowed to speak their language or to practice their culture, and many were mistreated and abused.\n\n\u201cThey made us believe we didn\u2019t have souls,\u201d said former residential school student Florence Sparvier at a press conference on Thursday. \u201cThey were putting us down as people, so we learned to not like who we were.\u201d\n\nA commission launched in 2008 to document the impacts of this system found that large numbers of indigenous children never returned to their home communities. The commission\u2019s landmark report said the practice amounted to cultural genocide.\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologised for the system.\n\nThe Roman Catholic church \u2013 which was responsible for the operations of up to 70% of residential schools \u2013 has not yet issued a formal apology.\n\nThe May discovery of 215 children\u2019s remains at the site of a former residential school in Kamloops has thrown a spotlight Canada\u2019s past policies of forced assimilation.\n\nIndigenous leaders expect similar findings as the search for grave sites continues, aided by new funding from federal and provincial governments.\n\nCities in the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick have cancelled upcoming celebrations for Canada Day on 1 July in protest, and statues of figures involved with residential schools, including Canada\u2019s first Prime Minister John A Macdonald, have been vandalised or removed throughout the country.",
