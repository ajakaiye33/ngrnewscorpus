          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nA Professor of Public Health and former National Chairman of the Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria, Prof. Tanimola Akande, has warned that if preventive measures are not out in place, Deltacron and other variants will be discovered in the country.\n\nProf. Akande also said preventive measures at the points of entry have not proven to be effective in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in the country.\n\nRecall that a scientist in Cyprus discovered Deltacron, which combines the Delta and Omicron strains.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg last Sunday, the new variant named \u2018Deltacron\u2019 was identified by a professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus and head of the Laboratory of Biotechnology and Molecular Virology, Leondios Kostrikis.\n\nSpeaking in a media interview Kostrikis said, \u201cThere are currently Omicron and Delta co-infections and we found this strain that is a combination of these two,\u201d adding that the new strain was named \u2018Deltacron\u2019 due to the identification of Omicron-like genetic signatures within its Delta genomes\n\nBloomberg reported that Kostrikis and his team have identified 25 such cases, noting that the statistical analysis shows that the relative frequency of the combined infection is higher among patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 as compared to non-hospitalised patients. The sequences of the 25 Deltacron cases were sent to GISAID, the international database that tracks changes in the virus, on January 7.\n\nExperts, however, said on Monday that an alleged hybrid coronavirus mutation dubbed \u201cDeltacron\u201d reportedly discovered in a Cyprus laboratory is most likely the result of lab contamination and not a new worrying variant.\n\nCypriot media reported the discovery Saturday, describing it as having \u201cthe genetic background of the Delta variant along with some of the mutations of Omicron\u201d.\n\nWhile it is possible for coronaviruses to genetically combine, it is rare, and scientists analysing the discovery of so-called \u201cDeltacron\u201d say it is unlikely.\n\n\u201cThe Cypriot \u2018Deltacron\u2019 sequences reported by several large media outlets look to be quite clearly contamination,\u201d Tom Peacock, a virologist with the infectious diseases department at Imperial College London, tweeted over the weekend.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Akande said \u201cNigeria needs to be worried since we know all variants eventually find their ways onto many countries as people travel globally.

          "text": "By Marie-Therese Nanlong, Jos\n\nThe authority of the Plateau State Polytechnic, Heipang, Barkin Ladi local government area has debunked the ongoing rumour that two students of the institution were abducted on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer of the institution, Matthew Dokotri in a phone conversation with Vanguard in Jos explained that there was an incident, which is being investigated by the Police but those abducted were not students of the Polytechnic.\n\nHis words, \u201cI came to the Main Campus and we went to the Barkin Ladi Police Station with the Chief Security Officer of the institution. We met the DPO of Barkin Ladi.\n\n\u201cWhat happened yesterday, the 12th of January, 2022; precisely by 8.15 pm, a male student by name Lucky Joel of ND1 Electrical Electronics Engineering Department made an illegal electrical connection from a lady\u2019s apartment to his own.\n\n\u201cWhen the lady found out, she engaged the boy, telling him that he should disconnect the illegal connection, the boy mobilized some other students nearby and they engage the woman in an argument.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAlleged N544m grass-cutting fraud: Why Babachir Lawal wasn\u2019t reported to security agencies \u2014 Witness\n\n\u201cThe woman said she was going to call the Police if the boy refused to disconnect the illegal connection, and the boy said he has a brother that is a soldier at Bokkos, he will also call his brother. Somehow, the boy pulled aside, the woman said she overheard him saying, \u201cku zo, ku zo\u201d, (meaning he was calling some people) but she did not know whether it was on phone or not.\n\n\u201cBut within a short while, some kidnappers came and took the two ladies, those ladies, Bencit and Lokfei are residing with the woman. A boy was also picked along with the ladies. The woman who raise the light issue escaped when those kidnappers came and they are suspected to be Fulanis.\n\n\u201cThe two ladies they picked are not students of our school. A call was made to the military, they came, I don\u2019t know what information they got but they arrested the boy, who is our student and handed it over to the Police.\n\nBased on the finding of the DPO, the boy is a suspect because he made the call based on what the woman said but they are still investigating him.\n\n\u201cEven our students did not know what happened, they are writing their exams, the campus is flourishing well with academic activities. The DPO said the investigation is ongoing, maybe more details will come later.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the State Police Command in a statement by its PPRO, ASP Gabriel Uba said, \u201cThe Command is aware of the kidnap incident in Ban Village behind Plateau State Polytechnic Heipang on the 12/01/2022 at about 20:05hrs where three persons were abducted.\n\nImmediately the report was received, a team of Policemen of the Command and OPSH raced to the scene where one suspect was arrested. Meantime, efforts are ongoing to rescue the kidnapped victims and arrest other perpetrators of the act.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Algerian players say Cameroon\u2019s tropical climate was a factor in their 0-0 draw against minnows Sierra Leone in their first match at the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe defending champions were held by a side ranked 108th in the world, despite carving out several chances in their Group E meeting played in the early afternoon in Douala.\n\nTemperatures of over 30 degrees Celsius were reported in the port city on Tuesday, with humidity above 70%.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult with the heat, and especially for us who play in Europe. We are not used to it,\u201d Algeria midfielder Haris Belkebla told BBC Sport Africa.\n\n\u201cWe suffered a lot.\u201d\n\nLeft-back Ramy Bensebaini, who saw a shot in second-half injury-time saved, described the match as \u201cvery complicated and very hot\u201d while Sierra Leone defender Steven Caulker said the humidity in the Japoma Stadium was \u201ccrazy\u201d.\n\nThe Desert Foxes are unbeaten in 35 senior international matches and have been heavily tipped to retain their title in Cameroon, but will hope for cooler conditions when they face Equatorial Guinea on Sunday.\n\nNorth African sides have struggled to make an impact in Nations Cups hosted in sub-Saharan Africa with only Morocco, in Ethiopia in 1976, and Egypt, in Burkina Faso in 1998, Ghana in 2008 and Angola in 2010, lifting the trophy at such tournaments.\n\nALSO READ: AFCON 2021: Eagles in confident mood ahead of Sudan game\n\nAlgeria lost 3-0 to Malawi in their first game in 2010, and also drew 0-0 with the hosts before being beaten 4-0 by Egypt in the semi-finals. They were beaten quarter-finalists in Equatorial Guinea in 2015 and failed to get out of their group two years later in Gabon.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t try and find excuses, we should adapt to the climatic conditions,\u201d Belkebla, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Brest, added.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work to win the coming matches. The objective is clear \u2013 we all need to do more to get some victories, to qualify and go for this cup.\u201d\n\nThe tournament was originally due to be staged in June and July last year but was moved to January 2021 to avoid Cameroon\u2019s rainy season \u2013 but then delayed a year by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBensebaini admitted Algeria were frustrated by Leone Stars goalkeeper Mohamed Nbalie Kamara, who made a string of saves.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t score, it\u2019s our fault,\u201d the defender said.\n\n\u201cIf we had managed to put the first goal, the match would have been different, the others would have come. We could have had a second a third, and even more because we had a lot of chances. It\u2019s just, I hope, a faux pas, and we will quickly bounce back.\n\n\u201cMy message to Algerians is: thank you for your encouragement, [and] to continue to believe in us. We don\u2019t give up,\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We knew he was trying to conceal some facts and our men quickly rushed the injured one to a nearby hospital where he later gave up the ghost. But the ring leader and the accomplice of the robbery gang we were able to apprehend.\n\n\u201cWe were able to retrieve the bus with registration number FKJ 430 XV as well as belongings of the victims. We also gave first aid to all the victims, 17 of them and we will ensure that they continue their journey back to Abuja safely.\u201d\n\nOne of the suspects, Musa Jamiu, 32, said it was the operation he joined his friends to execute.\n\n\u201cI am from Okenne and a farmer at Elegbeka, Ondo State. One \u2018MG\u2019 called me that why I\u2019m suffering myself as a farmer. He promised to assist me.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe race for President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023 has begun in earnest.\n\nIn Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, and across the country, \u201cpowerful forces across the political and corporate sphere\u201d are allegedly mounting pressure on Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo to throw his hat into the ring to succeed his boss.\n\nBut mum, so far, is the response from the Vice-President. Calls to his aides went unanswered.\n\nOn Monday, Osinbajo\u2019s political benefactor and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, formally informed President Buhari of his 2023 presidential ambition during a visit to the President\u2019s Aso Rock, Abuja, office.\n\nRegardless, Daily Sun learnt that, with Tinubu\u2019s Monday declaration, \u201cthe dynamics have changed.\u201d\n\nReligion as stumbling block\n\nA party source told Daily Sun that, prior to Tinubu\u2019s declaration of interest, the Vice-President has been under intense pressure from some interest groups, cutting across political and corporate sectors, to run for President in 2023.\n\nThe calculation, according to the source, is that religion would play a major role in who succeeds Buhari in 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Vice-President is under pressure to run from many interest groups and some \u2018powerful forces,\u2019 on the grounds that, if Asiwaju runs, then religion would be a decisive factor.\n\n\u201cThe North, particularly the North West, which has the bulk of northern votes, would not necessarily queue behind a Christian deputy and give him their votes. It\u2019s an open secret that they want the Vice-President\u2019s ticket; in the event that the APC (All Progressives Congress) finally decides to go to the South to pick its presidential candidate. \u201cSecondly, the southern candidate must be Christian, to balance out the eight years of President Buhari.\u201d\n\nProdded to name some of the \u201cpowerful forces,\u201d he replied curtly: \u201cThis is not the time for that but those encouraging him to run premise it on two factors: Age and religion. On account of age, he\u2019s young, and he\u2019s a Christian.\u201d\n\nHowever, a senior party official privy to the matter described the pressure on Osinbajo as \u201cmere speculation. You cannot shave the Vice-President\u2019s head in his absence\u2026The real fight, right now, is for control of the party.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, another party source reiterated that the major obstacle for the APC and the 2023 presidency is still religion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe permutation right now, if nothing happens to change that, is for the APC to produce a Christian candidate, from the South, backed by a northern Muslim as deputy.\n\n\u201cThe North West, as it stands, is insisting on picking the Vice-President\u2019s ticket and would not compromise on that\u2026At the moment, three governors and a serving minister have positioned themselves to be the choice of the party. The North, particularly the North West, would not be disposed to having a Christian representing them\u2026\u201d\n\nChoice of running mate\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nEven though the jostle for running mate among some governors in the North is at fever pitch, there is the clamour that the deputy should be picked from the North West.\n\n\u201cThree governors, one from the North East and another two from the North West, who are serving out their second terms, are keenly interested in oinking the Vice-President ticket of the APC. Initially, the agreement was to draft a Christian, second-term governor from the South West into the presidential race, who would, in turn, choose one of them as his deputy, after getting the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cBut the odds are not in his favour. For one, he would be out of the power loop by the time the intense power game starts, and, secondly, he may not have the war chest to go through electioneering,\u201d the source said.\n\nControl of party structure\n\nThe struggle for control of the party\u2019s structure, through the instrumentality of the party\u2019s National Working Committee, is high.\n\nThe battle for control of the party goes back to the 2013 merger of ACN, ANPP, a faction of APGA and CPC.\n\nWith the merger, which produced the APC, it was agreed that the CPC would produce the President while the ACN would produce the Vice-President and, as an icing on the cake, the ACN got to produce two national chairmen of the party.\n\nBut, after the 2019 presidential election, the CPC decided to go for broke, and, to a large extent, together with the ANPP bloc, realised they no longer needed the ACN bloc for the next round of elections. \u201cThat was why the preparation for 2023 started with edging out the former national chairman. The CPC is intent on producing officers for strategic positions in the party.\u201d\n\nAs at this month, the contending interests in APC, particularly the CPC bloc \u201cdon\u2019t have the numbers yet. They would have to woo states with highest numbers of delegates for the convention: Lagos, Kano, Borno and Katsina, because these states are not in CPC\u2019s hands. Organically, they don\u2019t have the numbers as yet.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why the convention cannot hold in February is because there\u2019s confusion on the way forward. Some influential party members are insisting on the presidential nomination before the delegates\u2019 convention. That cannot happen because it\u2019s like putting the cart before the horse. Another set of stakeholders is trying to persuade the President that the convention, even if it\u2019s going to be by consensus to choose the new NWC, should be allowed to hold soon.\u201d\n\nConsensus to choose party chairman, others\n\n\u201cFour governors, one from the North East, another from the North Central and two from the North West are strategising for a national chairman from the CPC bloc but they are yet to agree on a particular candidate, even as it emerged that a top shot in the party has asked to be allowed to produce candidates for the national chairman and national secretary positions,\u201d was the submission of a top party shot in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe other alternative, he added, yesterday, is to allow for consensus and \u201cthat\u2019s why the convention for February was struck off the table.\u201d\n\nThe APC has been beset with internal squabbles over the national convention. Last year (June 2021), it was shifted to December and, later, last November, it was shifted to February after some governors met with the President.\n\nThe President is expected is to meet with \u201cAPC governors to \u2018firmly agree\u2019 on a convention date and the mode of choosing candidates for the NWC.\u201d",

Economic watchers say billions of naira has been lost since the ban as most Nigerians use it as a platform to run their businesses.\n\nHowever, Kashifu Inuwa, the Director General of the Nigerian Information Technology Development Agency, (NITDA) while announcing the cherry news, said it was based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe immediate and remote cause of the suspension was the unceasing use of the platform by some unscrupulous elements for subversive purposes and criminal activities, propagation of fake news, and polarising Nigerians along tribal and religious lines, among others.

          "text": "\u2022Makinde cancels state event to mourn predecessor\n\n\u2022Obasanjo, Jonathan, Atiku, Tinubu, Gbajabiamila, Sanwo-Olu, Fayemi, others pay tributes\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Segun James in Lagos, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti, and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, commiserated with the family of former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Christopher Alao-Akala, and the government and people of the state on the demise of the ex-governor. Alao-Akala, who was governor of Oyo State between 2007 and 2011, died at his Ogbomoso country home early yesterday at 71.\n\nA statement by the family, signed by his son, Olamijuwonlo Alao-Akala, said their father died peacefully.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWith humble acceptance of the will of God, we announce the passing of our grandfather, father, husband, and leader, His Excellency, Otunba (Dr.) Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, JP, PSC, which occurred on Wednesday, 12th January 2022.\n\n\u201cBaba died peacefully in Ogbomoso at the age of 71. Omo Iya Alaro will remain in our hearts forever. Rest in Peace Baba.\n\n\u201cBurial arrangements will be announced by the family at a later date.\u201d\n\nBuhari, in a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, said Alao-Akala, as a former police officer and civilian governor with an extensive political career, served the country and the people of Oyo State with dedication, making very important contributions to the development of institutions and communities.\n\nThe president hoped that family, friends and associates, who mourned the former governor, would honour his vision of entrenching good governance in the country and passion to lift the downtrodden in the society. He prayed God Almighty to grant the departed eternal rest and comfort those he left behind.\n\nThe late All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain was said to be full of life Tuesday night, during which he spent time with his children before he went to bed.\n\nOyo State Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde, on learning of Alao-Akala\u2019s passing, abruptly ended the 2022 Inter-faith Prayer Service organised by the state\u2019s civil service. Makinde called for a minute silence in memory of the former governor, who also served as deputy governor of the state between 2003 and 2007, and prayed to God to grant repose to his soul.\n\nThe governor condoled with the immediate family of the deceased, his political associates, and residents of the state.\n\nMakinde stated at the inter-faith prayer meeting, \u201cI am here with the speech prepared for this event but I have just been informed about the death of former governor of the state, Otunba Adebayo Akala. I pray that God grant his loved ones and all his well-wishers the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nObasanjo: An Amiable Cop, Akala Was Above Narrow Precincts\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo said the vacuum created by the death of Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala would be difficult to fill. Obasanjo urged the former governor\u2019s admirers to put their faith in the Almighty Creator in the present situation.\n\nIn a condolence letter to the head of Akala Family in Ibadan, Obasanjo said his death \u201cis, indeed, a grievous loss to the entire members of his family, his friends and associates, Oyo State and, indeed, the entire nation.\u201d He added that Alao-Akala as a cop transcended narrow precincts.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s letter, which was made available to newsmen in Abeokuta by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, stated, \u201cOtunba Alao-Akala was an outstanding Nigerian and leader, who contributed immensely to the development and stability of Oyo State and Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\u201cAs an amiable cop, he transcended the narrow precincts of what used to be cultural limitation to tower over his peers. From a distinguished career of a crime buster, he straddled the \u2018Pacesetter State\u2019 like a colossus. His humble career as a policeman did not stymie his ascendancy to the height of a governor and, unprecedentedly, crowned him as a high achieving deputy governor, who became an acting governor and later governor.\n\n\u201cThere seemed to be nothing stopping the effervescent enigma. His politics had been that of a thoroughbred statesman determined to make the critical difference in the lives of the people he led and he succeeded in building confidence across a wide spectrum of the social strata and validated the mandate bestowed on him as the Executive Governor of Oyo State. Indeed, the vacuum created by his death would, undoubtedly, be difficult to fill. I assure you that we all share your sense of deep grief.\u201d\n\nJonathan: He Was a Committed Public Servant\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, joined other Nigerians to mourn Alao-Akala, saying the deceased was a dedicated public servant, who served the nation to the best of his abilities.\n\nStressing that the late politician died at a time his services were still needed, Jonathan stated, \u201cHe was a public-spirited individual, who excelled in many endeavours in both his private and public life, and never got tired of giving his best to the task of nation-building.\n\n\u201cAs a police officer, he rose through the ranks and diligently served the nation in various capacities before retiring as an Assistant Commissioner of Police. He was a key player in the Fourth Republic politics, especially, in Oyo State, where he served as deputy governor and governor.\u201d\n\nThe former president highlighted Alao-Akala\u2019s considerable achievements, saying he would \u201cbe sadly missed, because he still had a lot to offer, given his experience, wisdom and determination to contribute to the development of the nation.\u201d\n\nAtiku: His Record as Governor Remains Enviable\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar mourned the passing of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, but took solace in his enviable record as governor.\n\nWhile describing his death as a rude shock, Atiku, in a press release by his media office, said Alao-Akala was a prolific politician. He condoled with the people and government of Oyo State on the loss of a notable leader, and urged his family and associates to take solace in the good legacies he left behind.\n\nTinubu: Alao-Akala\u2019s Passing is Disheartening\n\nNational leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said the death of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, a month after the death of Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, was disheartening.\n\nIn a condolence statement by his media office, signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, Tinubu said, \u201cI received the news of the passing of former governor of Oyo State, Otunba Alao-Akala, with shock and deep sadness.\n\n\u201cComing a month after the death of Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, the loss of Alao- Akala, another eminent son of Ogbomoso and Oyo State, is disheartening. Alao-Akala was a leader and prominent politician, who did his best not only for his Ogbomoso hometown, but also Oyo State and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe served the country meritoriously in the police force, rising to the top of the ladder before venturing into politics. As governor of Oyo State, he contributed his quota to the development of the state and tried to enhance the welfare of the people.\n\n\u201cAlao-Akala passed on when the state and, particularly, our All Progressives Congress, needed his services. His wisdom and experience were required to help resolve the leadership crisis in the state and weld the party together once again.\u201d\n\nAlao-Akala Was a Strong APC Pillar, Says Gbajabiamila\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, expressed sadness over the death of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, and described him as a strong pillar of the APC. Gbajabiamila, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, recalled the good leadership Alao-Akala provided in Oyo State, when he served as governor, saying he made his mark in the state.\n\nAs a chieftain of the APC, Gbajabiamila said Alao-Akala was at the forefront of efforts to promote progressive politics. Sending his condolences to the Alao-Akala family, the people and the government of Oyo State, the speaker prayed God to grant Alao-Akala\u2019s soul eternal rest.\n\nSanwo-Olu: His Demise Has Opened a Deep Sore\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the death of Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala had opened a deep sore in the hearts of the people of Oyo State and Nigeria, who looked up to him as a rallying point and a political stabiliser.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who commiserated with his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, and the APC family in the state, also consoled the deceased\u2019s family, noting that the former governor\u2019s service to the people of Ogbomoso, Oyo State and Nigeria as a whole remained his enduring legacy.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Lagos, I commiserate with my brother, the Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, sons and daughters of Ogbomoso, people of Oyo State, the deceased family, friends, and political associates on the death of Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala.\n\n\u201cThe passage of Otunba Alao-Akala hurts me, because of the critical role he was playing in Oyo APC before his demise. My heart was filled with grief, when I was informed about his death.\n\n\u201cOtunba Alao-Akala was more than a politician. He was a man of many parts, whose managerial skills and experience are required at this critical period in our national life, especially, in our party, APC, ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cHe served Oyo State passionately, first, as a deputy governor and later as governor. He did his best in contributing his quota to the growth and development of Ogbomoso, as council chairman as well as Oyo State as a governor. He also made his mark in the Nigeria Police, where he retired as Assistant Commissioner of Police in 1995 before venturing into politics.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu urged the family of the deceased to take heart, saying, \u201cThe death of loved ones is usually one of the most painful episodes in peoples\u2019 lives but we must realise that death is inevitable. We all will die someday. Therefore, we must muster enough strength to carry on.\u201d\n\nAlao-Akala Was a Pragmatic Leader, Says Fayemi\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, condoled with the government and people of Oyo State on the death of Otunba Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala, describing him as a pragmatic leader.\n\nExtolling the virtues of the deceased, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi said the late Alao-Akala was a colourful politician, pragmatic leader, and a man of the people in and out of office. Fayemi said he was shocked by the death of the former governor, who, according to him, was in his usual high spirit during their last meeting and showed no sign of illness.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor described Alao-Akala as an apostle of politics without bitterness and a leader, whose interaction, influence and network cut across political divides. He noted that Alao-Akala played a prominent role in the restoration of peace to the Oyo State chapter of APC and inter-party harmony in the state.\n\nAccording to Fayemi, Alao-Akala\u2019s life was defined by service to the people, first, as a police officer, rising to the rank of Assistant Commissioner, and later, as a politician, public servant, and elder statesman, whose doors were always open to the common man.\n\nBuni: He Increased the Fortunes of APC\n\nChairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Governor, Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, described Adebayo Alao-Akala as a man, who increased the fortunes of APC in Oyo and the country at large.\n\nBuni, in a statement, expressed shock over Alao-Akala\u2019s death, stating, \u201cThe APC has received with sorrow, the death of former Governor of Oyo State and APC chieftain in the state. It is with grief and sorrow that we lost His Excellency, Alao Akala at this moment of our national life.\u201d\n\nBuni said Alao-Akala was a national political asset that was sought after by all political parties, adding, \u201cIt is saddening that we lost this asset at a time when we commenced the process to our next general election.\u201d\n\nHe condoled with Alao-Akala\u2019s family, the government and people of Oyo State over the huge loss.\n\nChairman, Senate Committee on Local Content and senator for Oyo Central, Senator Teslim Folarin, also said he was heartbroken by the news of Alao-Akala\u2019s death, lamenting that Oyo State has lost a phenomenal statesman.\n\nFolarin, in a statement he personally signed, stated that the former governor\u2019s death came \u201cat a crucial time his leadership and wise counsel are needed, especially, by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply heartbroken after receiving the shocking news of our leader\u2019s demise. I still could not believe that Oga Akala has left us. Who are we to question God\u2019s Decision?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the APC in the state described Alao-Akala\u2019s death as sad and shocking. A statement by the Caretaker Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Dr. AbdulAzeez Olatunde, said Oyo APC lost one of its pillars.\n\nOlatunde stated, \u201cLess than two years after the loss of His Excellency, Senator Abiola Adeyemi Akanji Ajimobi, APC in Oyo State, on Wednesday, 12th January, 2022, shockingly got the sad news of the demise of one of the pillars of the party, His Excellency, Christopher Adebayo Alao-Akala.\n\n\u201cAPC commiserates with party members in Oyo State and diaspora, especially, all Oyo State indigenes on the sad and shocking news.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the caretaker chairman of APC in Oyo State, Chief Akin Oke, the state executives, and all the APC members in Oyo State, we commiserate with the family of our departed former governor.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says social media platform has agreed to respect Nigeria\u2019s laws\n\nBy Olawale Ajimotokan\n\n\n\nThe federal government of Nigeria has lifted the ban on Twitter effective from 12 midnight of January 13, 2022.\n\nThis comes exactly 222 days after the government suspended the Twitter in the country.\n\nThe lifting of the ban was announced yesterday in a statement issued by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and the Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdulahi, who said the approval was granted following a memo written to the President by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim, after the social networking platform agreed to respect Nigeria\u2019s laws and culture.\n\nThe NITDA DG said, Pantami in the Memo, updated and requested the president\u2019s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cThe federal government directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12am tonight, 13th January 2022.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that on 5th June 2021, the FGN suspended the operation of Twitter through an announcement made by the Honourable Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the President constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc. Subsequently, in its wisdom, the Presidential Committee set a 20-member Technical Committee comprising all relevant government agencies. The Technical Committee engaged and worked directly with the Twitter team,\u201d Abdulahi explained in the statement. The federal government had suspended Twitter\u2019s operation in the country on June 5, 2021, after the social media platform deleted some tweets made by the president which it had perceived were not appropriate. However, Abdulahi said the ban was lifted after Twitter agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation had been built. In addition, he said the company has agreed to collaborate with the federal government and the broader industry to develop a Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries. Other conditions which Twitter accepted included committing to setting up an establishment in the country in the first quarter of this year. The company would register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), with the establishment of the entity being Twitter\u2019s first step in demonstrating its long-term commitment to Nigeria. Also, Twitter has agreed to appoint a designated country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities as well as complying with applicable tax obligations on its operations under the Nigerian law. The statement stressed that Twitter has agreed to enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, which provides a direct channel for government officials and Twitter staff to manage prohibited content that violates Twitter community rules. The federal government said the Law Enforcement Portal provides a channel for the law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian Laws. \u201cTherefore, the FGN lifts the suspension of the Twitter operations in Nigeria from midnight of 13th January 2022. \u201cWe encourage all users of the Twitter platform to maintain ethical behaviour and refrain from promoting divisive, dangerous, and distasteful information on the platform. \u201cAs patriotic citizens, we need to be mindful that anything illegal offline is also illegal online and that committing a crime using a Nigerian Internet Protocol (IP) is synonymous with committing a crime within our jurisdiction,\u201d Abdulahi said. He described government\u2019s action as a deliberate attempt to recalibrate its relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for the nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the company. \u201cThe new global reality is that digital platforms and their operators wield enormous influence over the fabric of our society, social interaction and economic choices. These platforms can be used as either a tool or a weapon. Every nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently. Without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake. Therefore, our engagement has been very respectful, cordial, and successful,\u201d he said. He added that the process of resolving the impasse between the federal government and Twitter has helped lay a foundation for a mutually beneficial future with endless possibilities. He described Twitter as a platform of choice for many Nigerians ranging from young innovators to public sector officials who find it helpful to engage their audience He said the engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria, adding government looks forward to providing a conducive environment for Twitter and other global tech companies to achieve their potential and be sustainably profitable in Nigeria. Abdulahi noted that given Twitter\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s democracy, its economy, and the very fabric of its corporate existence as a nation, government\u2019s priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter, adding the country is committed to working with Twitter to do anything possible to help Nigerians align and navigate Twitter algorithmic design to realise its potentials while avoiding its perils.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Shonekan died yesterday in Lagos of natural causes, his family said. He was aged 85 years.\n\nA statement by the family, signed by one of his children, Adeboye Shonekan, said, \u201cTo the glory of the Almighty, the Shonekan family announces the passing of our patriarch, loving husband to Margaret, dutiful father to us all and former Head of State, Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan, GCFR, CBE, the Baba Sale of Egbaland.\n\n\u201cHe passed this morning of natural causes at the age of 85. The family will release further details in due course.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he received the news of Shonekan\u2019s passing with sadness. In a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, on behalf of the federal government, Buhari extended deepest condolences to Shonekan\u2019s wife, Margaret, loved ones, as well as the government and people of Ogun State.\n\nThe president paid tribute to Shonekan, saying though an internationally respected statesman, with courageous wisdom, he left his flourishing business to become the Head of Government at a delicate time, when the country needed someone of his calm mien and pedigree to save the ship of state from sinking.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo said Shonekan was a unifying force that helped to bind the country together at a time of great uncertainty.\n\nFormer military president Ibrahim Babangida, who had appointed Shonekan head of the interim government, extolled his sterling qualities, saying they qualified him for the tough job.\n\nEx-President Goodluck Jonathan, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, and All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, were also among prominent Nigerians who paid tribute to the departed leader.\n\nBuhari said Shonekan demonstrated to all that his love for country and commitment to its development, peace, and unity transcended the trappings of office and the transient nature of political power.\n\n\u201cBuhari believed that Nigeria owes a great debt to Chief Shonekan, the peacemaker, who even at the twilight of his life time never stopped believing and working for a prosperous and democratic country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe president prayed that the memory of the departed would remain a blessing to Nigeria even as he finds perfect peace with the Almighty God.\n\nBuhari Directs National Flag to Fly Half-Mast for Shonekan\n\nThe president directed that the national flag should be flown at half mast from January 12 to 14 as a mark of respect for the former Head of State. Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, announced the directive in a statement last night.\n\nObasanjo: He Was a Unifying Force for Nigeria\n\nObasanjo, yesterday, described Shonekan, as a unifying force for the nation.\n\nObasanjo, who was on an international assignment as the High Representative of the African Union for the Horn of Africa, said he received with great shock the news of the death of one of Africa\u2019s illustrious sons. He declared that Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the growth and development of democracy in Nigeria could not be forgotten in a hurry.\n\nObasanjo sent a condolence letter to the wife of the deceased, Mrs. Margaret Shonekan, copy of which was made available to newsmen in Abeokuta by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi. In the letter, the former president said the late business mogul was \u201ca role model and an epitome of the good in the nation\u2019s business firmament of mixed blessings.\n\n\u201cHe would be remembered as a man of sustained strong will to succeed. Coming from humble background, rising, stepping and peaking at the topmost plum in corporate management, and the very top of the giant United Africa Company (UAC) ladder, attest to his sagacity, tenacity and steadfastness.\n\n\u201cHe founded, in 1994, the Economic Summit Group, an advocacy group and think tank for private sector-led development of the Nigerian economy, and it remains, till today, sustaining the legacy of helping to support stakeholders in the execution of policies, programmes and strategies in response to any emerging trends in national and global economies.\u201d\n\nOn the political scene, Obasanjo noted that Shonekan, as head of the ING in 1993, which was short-lived for three months through the palace coup orchestrated by General Sani Abacha, \u201crendered outstanding service to our country, and we will never forget that.\n\n\u201cIt is also worthy of note that as Special Envoy on the Implementation of the Abuja Agreement on Zimbabwe in 2001 under my administration as the President of Nigeria; and Chairman, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) under Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s administration in 2008, he was forthright, dedicated and showed great patriotism in the discharge of his duties.\n\n\u201cHe was a unifying force for the nation and his contribution to the growth and development of democracy in Nigeria cannot be forgotten in a hurry. In all situations, he lived nobly and he died in nobility. He was an achiever.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Chief Shonekan died at a time the country is in dire need of his leadership, wealth of experience and wisdom to tackle the multifaceted challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nIBB: Why I Made Shonekan Head of Interim Government\n\nFormer military president Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, while mourning the passing of Shonekan, also explained why he appointed him head of the interim national government, when he stepped aside as military president.\n\nIBB, as Babangida is called, said Shonekan was a man of ideas and ideals, who was prudent and preached a lot about fiscal discipline. \u201cIt was, therefore, timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilise the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution.,\u201d Babangida stated\n\nIn a condolence message, Babangida expressed shock over the news of Shonekan\u2019s death and described him as one of Nigeria\u2019s finest brains and patriots.\n\nBabangida said, in a statement, \u201cI hadn\u2019t the faintest idea that Chief Ernest Shonekan would depart this sinful world too soon, even at 85. He was a man, a leader and an uncommon patriot, who had a presence of mind and whose understanding of Nigeria was profound and remarkable. It is, indeed, a personal loss to me.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was one of our cerebral minds during our time in government. He was the architect of our principle of free market economy, which helped to open up the system for a robust participation by the private sector. The liberalisation of the economy, the investment and boost in the agricultural sector and budget management approach were part of his brainchild.\n\n\u201cI recollect very vividly how he used to give us tutorials on budget, planning and management of national resources, each time he was invited to our session. At each budget year, Chief Shonekan would be invited to critique our budget proposals, and gave us further input to enrich the final budget. He was a man of ideas and ideals. He was prudent and preached so much about fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cIt was, therefore, timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilise the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution. He was a calm personality, whose managerial skills were foretold in the way and manner he managed a lot of blue chip companies.\n\n\u201cAs Head of the Interim Government, he was able to consult with a broad spectrum of the Nigerian populace in charting a roadmap out of the political impasse at that time. His brilliance and meticulous interrogation of situations helped in large measure to forge ahead during the period.\n\n\u201cI owe a personal gratitude to him throughout his sojourn on earth as we maintained very robust mutual relationship after his exit from the corridors of power.\u201d\n\nThe former military president added regarding Shonekan, \u201cGiven the achievements we recorded during our time in government in the area of infrastructure, economy and social rebirth, I owe a word of gratitude to him for his experienced intervention in helping to dissect our policy frameworks each time we called upon him to do so.\n\n\u201cHe was an engaging personality, whose sense of patriotism was total. He was friendly and sociable. He understood economy and made so many projections that helped us to bail the country out of economic conundrum. We benefited from his immense knowledge, experience and brilliance.\u201d\n\nJonathan, Atiku, Ayu Mourn, Pay Tributes\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, joined other Nigerians to mourn the passing of Chief Ernest Shonekan.\n\nJonathan, in a condolence message to his family and the government of Ogun State, described Shonekan as \u201can elder statesman, well-loved for his sincerity and sense of purpose.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, Chief Shonekan was well-respected, because of the enormous goodwill he brought into governance. He was a compassionate and determined administrator, a peacemaker and bridge builder, who stepped in to lead the nation at a very difficult time in the history of its political evolution.\n\n\u201cBefore he assumed office as the head of the Interim National Government in 1993, Chief Shonekan had become a boardroom guru, having established himself as a foremost industrialist and one of the leaders of the business world.\n\n\u201cHe left enduring legacies, part of which was his considerable effort towards mainstreaming the private sector in the development drive of the nation, especially, with the institutionalisation of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), which he founded.\u201d\n\nJonathan said Shonekan would be remembered for his great wisdom, peaceful disposition, the goodwill he extended to all, as well as his significant contributions to the growth of the economy of the nation.\n\nAtiku said, in his own message, \u201cIt is with a sad heart that I received the news of the death of the former Head of State and Chairman of the defunct Interim National Government, Chief Earnest Shonekan.\u201d\n\nIn the statement he personally signed, Atiku stated, \u201cMy grief is predicated, not just on the demise of the elder statesman, because he died at a prime age,\u201d but on his exit at a time, when the country needed his skills and global connections find solution to its multifarious challenges.\n\nThe former vice president stated, \u201cEither as a politician or a boardroom guru, Chief Shonekan possessed a unique set skill of bringing stability to a tumultuous situation. That obviously was the consideration that made him become Head of the Interim National Government following the crises that greeted the events after the June 12 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAlthough his reign as Head of State was interim, Chief Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the peace and development of Nigeria in those days and latter years, remains enduring.\n\n\u201cMy condolences go to his immediate family, the people and government of Ogun State and the entire nation for the loss of a man of industry and intellect, who lived a life of service to the country and humanity. It is my prayer that God Almighty receives his soul in a peaceful repose.\u201d\n\nAyu, while condoling with the federal government, the government of Ogun State, and the family of the departed corporate giant, described Shonekan as \u201ca detribalised Nigerian and elder statesman, who gave Nigeria his best.\u201d\n\nThe PDP chairman also said of Shonekan, \u201cHis death is a sunset on an illustrious career that straddled both the corporate sector and the public service. We are consoled that he lived a fulfilled life, and that his legacy of public service will outlive him.\u201d\n\nLawan: He\u2019ll be Remembered for Heeding Nigeria\u2019s Call to Duty\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, said Shonekan would be remembered for heeding the nation\u2019s call to duty at a critical time.\n\nLawan, in a statement, condoled with Shonekan\u2019s family and the government and people of Ogun State over the death of the former Nigerian leader.\n\nThe senate president\u2019s message read, \u201cMy condolences go to the family of Chief Shonekan, the government and people of Ogun State and entire Nigeria over this great loss. Chief Shonekan was a lawyer, business captain, boardroom guru and statesman.\n\n\u201cBut he will be most remembered for heeding the nation\u2019s call to duty at a very turbulent period in the history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan\u2019s services as Chairman of the Transitional Council and later as Head of the Interim National Government were selfless and contributed greatly to saving the Nigerian ship from hitting the rock\u201d.\n\nAbiodun: His Death is a Colossal Loss\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, described the death of Shonekan as a huge loss. Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, lamented that Shonekan, a former chairman of UAC Nigeria Plc., passed on at a period Nigeria needed his experience most as a technocrat.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cChief Shonekan was a first-class administrator, boardroom guru and astute leader, whose imprint in the business and political firmaments cannot be erased. His commitment to peaceful resolution and patriotic fervour will live after him.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan, an Egba traditional chief (Babasale of Egbaland), was a true Nigerian, who spent most of his life for the betterment of the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor lamented the huge vacuum created by Shonekan\u2019s death.\n\nTinubu: He\u2019d Have Led Nigeria Same Way He Led UAC\n\nNational leader of APC, Bola Tinubu, yesterday, said were the circumstances of his ascension to power different, Shonekan would have led Nigeria the same way he led the United Africa Company (UAC).\n\nTinubu, in his condolence message, released by his media office and signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, commiserated with Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Shonekan\u2019s widow, Mrs. Magret Shonekan, and the people of Ogun State over his passing.\n\nThe APC leader stated, \u201cI received with great sadness the news of the passing of the former Head of the Interim National Government, Chief Shonekan, at the advanced age of 85. I join his immediate family in mourning his passing, but also in celebrating his lifelong contributions to our great nation.\n\n\u201cWith his passing, the country has lost another important elder-statesman; a man of peace, who tried to bring unity and concord during one of the nation\u2019s most trying moments.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest was a technocrat and boardroom guru. He performed excellently as Chairman of United African Company, a vast Nigerian conglomerate. Indeed, were the circumstances of his ascension to the top position in our country different, I have little doubt that Chief Shonekan would have led Nigeria with the same vision and skill with which he guided UAC.\n\n\u201cHe had the character, competence, capability and the technical background to undertake the job. In his brief time as Head of State, Chief Shonekan tried his best to advance peace, stability and development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan will be remembered as a peacemaker and Head of State, who took office at a most difficult time. I commiserate with his immediate family, most especially, his loving wife, Mrs. Margret, Governor Dapo Abiodun, and all the people of Ogun State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu: He was Committed to Nigeria\u2019s Peace, Unity\n\nChairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, called Shonekan a nationalist, who was committed to the nation\u2019s peace and unity. in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Richard Olatunde, Akeredolu described Shonekan\u2019s death as a huge loss to the country, noting that the vast experience of the elder statesman was an asset to the country, particularly, with the array of challenges confronting Nigeria.\n\nThe governor said Shonekan was committed to the peace and unity of the country, and pursued it with vigour and dedication as a patriot. He said the service of the former Head of Interim National Government would never be forgotten in the country\u2019s history.\n\nAkeredolu stated, \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was a nationalist per excellence. His belief in a united and peaceful Nigeria was unparalleled. He was dedicated to the progress and development of the county. He will be sorely missed.\n\n\u201cHis historic and patriotic role in maintaining the unity of the country was one of the many things that endeared him to many. He was, indeed, an asset; his counsels were useful for national cohesion and progress.\u201d\n\nWike: Shonekan Boasted Topnotch Administrative Credentials\n\nRivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, while mourning the passing of Shonekan, said his excellent administrative credentials helped in steering the ship of the country at a very critical time.\n\nIn his condolence massage, signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Wike also described Shonekan as a dedicated Nigerian, who was committed to the peace and stability of the country. He said Shonekan\u2019s strong credentials as an astute administrator enabled him to steadfastly steer the country through one of its most turbulent times.\n\nWike said in the message, \u201cOn behalf of the government and good people of Rivers State, I offer our deepest condolences to the family, relatives of the former Chairman, Interim National Government and the people of Nigeria.\u201d The governor said Nigeria had lost an elder statesman whose wisdom, foresight, and steadfast commitment would always be remembered.\n\nUzodimma: in Shonekan, Nigeria Lost a Patriot\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said the death of Shonekan was painful, stressing that the country has lost a great patriot.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser, Oguwike Nwachuku, Uzodimma said Shonekan was one of Nigeria\u2019s statesmen and legal luminaries, who believed in the unity, progress and development of the country and actually worked hard in private and public sectors for the realisation of that dream.\n\nUzodimma added that Shonekan\u2019s legacy at the United African Company (UAC) would always speak volumes. He said Nigerians would not forget his contributions in a hurry.\n\nWhile regretting that the country had lost a boardroom icon, when his fatherly and statesman pieces of advice were highly needed, Uzodimma specifically commiserated with his widow, Mrs Margaret Shonekan, the entire Shonekan family, his friends, and the government and people of Ogun State over the loss.\n\nOn behalf of his family and the people of Imo State, the governor also condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerians over Shonekan\u2019s death, and prayed God Almighty to grant the soul of the deceased a peaceful repose, and those he left behind him, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nPDP: Shonekan, a Bridge-builder; His Death, a National Tragedy\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, mourned the death of Shonekan, describing him as a bridge-builder, and his passing, as a national tragedy.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Shonekan, PDP said Shonekan was a courageous, humble and patriotic leader. The opposition party said the departed leader was a bridge builder and an extraordinary statesman, who dedicated his life and made immense sacrifices to ensure the unity and stability of the country in the heat of the political crisis that threatened the corporate existence of the country following the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.\n\nThe main opposition party said Shonekan was an accomplished personality and a visionary leader, whose efforts in applying his vast experience as a consummate lawyer and businessman to reposition the nation, despite the daunting challenges faced by his three-month regime between August and November 1993, could not be forgotten.\n\nPDP said, \u201cChief Shonekan\u2019s commitment to the entrenchment of democracy was evident in his determination to restore the rule of law and transparency in governance.\n\n\u201cEven outside office, Chief Shonekan remained committed to the unity, stability and development of our nation. Our party grieves that he left the stage at the time the nation needed his wealth of experience and wise counsel the most.\u201d\n\nPDP commiserated with the federal government, the government and people of Ogun State, and the Shonekan family, praying God to grant the nation and the bereaved family the fortitude to bear the huge national loss.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s One of Last Generation of Pioneer Business Leaders\u2019\n\nStakeholders in the private sector, yesterday, reacted to the passage of Chief Earnest Shonekan and described him as one of the last generation of pioneer business leaders in Nigeria, who contributed immensely to the growth of the various sectors of the economy.\n\nPresident, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), Dr. Al-Mujtaba Abubakar, said Shonekan\u2019s demise was a \u201cbig loss to the private sector.\n\n\u201cHis was a life well spent; a life of extraordinary achievements from the boardroom to the highest office in the land.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director, Nigeria Private Sector Alliance (NiPSA), Mr. Nwiabu Legborsi Nuka, said, \u201cNigeria has lost a leader of repute and builder of businesses\u201d.\n\nIn the same vein, former Director General, ACCI, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, described Shonekan as an enigma in the corporate world, having served on the boards of many blue chip companies as chairman.\n\nEkechukwu said, \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was an enigma in the corporate world, as he served on the boards of many blue chip companies as Chairman. He distinguished himself as a role model for directors of companies on what running private sector boards should look like.\n\n\u201cIt was on the strength of these leadership qualities that he was appointed an Interim Head of State in Nigeria. Some of the board structures set out by him are still in place today. He will be missed by the corporate world. May his soul rest in peace. Amen.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tarneem Saeed: The entrepreneur at the forefront of Sudan\u2019s economic renaissance",
          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Crazily high valuations, investor FOMO, the ripple effects of Y Combinator\u2019s new deal",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, January 10, 2022, startup accelerator Y Combinator announced that it would be increasing its deal size for future investments from $125,000 to $500,000. For many, the news was great because founders would get more money from the accelerator.\n\nHowever, quite a few people have expressed concerns about what this could mean for founders and investors. Here, we look at the deal and what it means for African founders.\n\nWhat is YC\u2019s new deal?\n\nAccording to the terms of the new deal, Y Combinator will invest $125,000 for 7% of a company as it has always done. However, it will also invest an additional $375,000 on \u201can uncapped safe with a Most Favored Nation (\u201cMFN\u201d) provision.\u201d This second provision has some people worried, but first, what is an MFN?\n\nNB: SAFE is short for simple agreement for future equity. It is an agreement that allows investors to invest in a company with a promise from the company to give stocks to the investor when they raise a priced round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most favoured nation status is not peculiar to the venture capital world and has been used for years in international trade and international politics. According to Investopedia, the MFN clause requires that a country provides the same concessions it does to one nation to all World Trade Organization (WTO) member countries.\n\nExtrapolating to venture capital and YCs deal specifically means that when YC startups raise their next round, YCs $375k investment will be converted to shares in the company at the most favourable terms of any investor in the round. In other words, YC is giving startups an extra $375,000 at a future valuation that they (Y Combinator) don\u2019t control.\n\nWhat does this mean for African startups and founders?\n\nOn the surface, this sounds like a better deal for African startup founders \u2013 $500k upfront is a lot of money and could help stave off the pressure to raise immediately if the startup runs a lean operation.\n\nKevin Simmons thinks this is a great deal for founders. \u201cFrom the founder\u2019s side, if you\u2019re looking to raise $1 million, for instance, with YC offering you half of that, it\u2019s a no-brainer to take the deal and get the balance from other investors.\n\n\u201cIt could also mean that founders increasingly go after YC. So if you\u2019re the competition and your customers are going in one direction, you either have to offer them more money or better terms to compete because you don\u2019t want to lose the best companies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave is a Y Combinator portfolio company and its most valuable African startup.\n\nOne issue that has been raised is how difficult it is for startups in Africa to raise at high valuations. However, that is not entirely correct. Raising money at high valuations would always be tough because founders need to convince investors that their businesses are worth as much as they say\n\nBut there has been such astronomical growth in the funding landscape that stakeholders now have conversations about extremely high startup valuations \u2014 an issue that was non-existent just a few years ago. In 2021, startups in Africa raised about $4.3 billion \u2014 2.5x the amount raised in 2020. With more money flowing into the ecosystem, startups will find it easier to raise money at high valuations.\n\nMost startups raise money to stay afloat before joining YC. However, YC acceptance has been seen as a sign of validation for startups, especially for African startups. This has made it easier for them to raise money from investors after YCs Demo Day as they receive increased visibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Simmons, \u201cThere are two ways to look at Y Combinator\u2019s deal. If you go into Y Combinator, you\u2019re setting yourself up for high expectations anyway, and it\u2019s because YC is believed to be thorough in their screening and selection of great startups. Those expectations come down to dollars and cents, which means they have to raise at higher valuations and build bigger businesses post-YC.\u201d\n\nWith the new deal, YC gets a larger piece of the startup post-YC at the same value as subsequent investors. For the founders, it means giving up a larger part of their company before they have gotten to the Series A round.\n\nSince the announcement, many investors, most of whom are from minority regions such as Latin America and Africa, have expressed concern that this could shut out local investors from the cap table \u2014 a vital move for startups that hope to tap into the local network these investors provide. However, not all investors in these regions agree.\n\nBiola Alabi, an angel investor, believes that the benefits of going through YC will outweigh any perceived disadvantages of the deal.\n\n\u201cI think that most early-stage investors will also benefit as long as they come in early. The benefit of going through YC will outweigh some of the initial trepidations around if this will affect smaller investors. The most important thing is to believe and invest with conviction. Valuations will work themselves out. The market will also dictate these in the end.\u201d\n\nDespite the increase in investment going into African startups, there is still a need for super early investors who can come in either at the pre-seed or seed stages. For the most part, African startups at this stage have raised little amounts of capital, usually under $2 million. However, YCs move could exclude most angel investors and smaller VCs who invest at this round.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave co-founders Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk (right). Wave is a Y Combinator portfolio company.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this change will affect other accelerators and investors, but Simmons believes that because of the growth witnessed in 2021, local investors will have an easier time raising capital from LPs which means they can invest higher amounts in startups.\n\nHe also points out that startups will probably think twice about joining YC just because of the brand.\n\n\u201cIf you went to YC before for the name thinking the 7% was not a big sacrifice to make, now you have to take $500k, and yes, it\u2019s not all at 7%, but it gives them more influence.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the founders either have to raise smaller amounts before getting into YC or abandon the idea entirely, as raising future rounds at low valuations would mean giving up huge parts of the company. On the flip side, this could mean that local investors bet on these startups early enough without waiting for the validation that comes with a YC acceptance.\n\nInvestors have typically shied away from using uncapped SAFEs, but YCs willingness to use them could be a game-changer.\n\n\u201cWith YC being such a big brand, will other investors be more willing to take on uncapped SAFEs? Just like the SAFE became standard practice, could we see the uncapped SAFE gain more acceptance?\u201d Simmons queried.\n\nModupe Odele, a lawyer and Founder of Vazi Legal, advises that startups that want YC onboard should ensure they get angel checks before signing YCs MFN SAFE. Furthermore, they need a lawyer to review the terms to ensure that the MFN clause is not retroactive. However, going by YCs announcement, it doesn\u2019t appear that this is the case.\n\nThere are no indications that YCs deal should keep founders up at night. Since it funded the first African startup in 2009, it has only funded 66 African startups. With over 800 deals done in Africa in 2021, that represents a tiny portion of deals that go on in Africa. Should other investors follow suit, that could become worrisome.\n\nWith Africa\u2019s startup funding landscape not yet at the level of its American and European counterparts, it could get more challenging for African startups to raise money locally if they wish to go through Y Combinator. On the other hand, it could encourage more local investors to scout and invest in companies at really early stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

I\u2019m writing this newsletter a day before, so I can\u2019t confirm if Twitter will work without a VPN.\n\nHowever, I hope it works because I have officially exited my VPN Family subscription WhatsApp group.\n\nThe federal government indefinitely blocked access to Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021. It was announced by the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture via its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nThe Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the platform was being used for \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe ban was met with outrage by Nigerians who felt it was a trample on their fundamental human rights.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to go down memory lane, here are some articles that examined the effects of the Twitter ban, reactions to it and events that took place after it.\n\nCracking YC\u2019s SAFE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, January 10, 2022, startup accelerator Y Combinator announced that it would be increasing its deal size for future investments from $125,000 to $500,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this seems like great news, as startups will get more funding, there are some concerns about what this could mean for the startup ecosystem.\n\nThe new deal has some caveats that have some people worried. It will continue to invest $125,000 as it always does, but the additional $375,000 will be something called an uncapped simple agreement for future equity (SAFE).\n\nChimgozirim will help us make sense of what this means later today.

It crawled roles from several job websites and matched job seekers via its recruitment management system.\n\nAfter several iterations, the startup morphed into what is now known as SeamlessHR in 2018. By 2020 it had an interesting list of clients \u2014 NIBSS, Providus Bank, PwC, Sterling Bank, Wema Bank \u2014 in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nThe startup has grown in the last four years, handling HR management, payroll, and recruitment management for organisations with about 10 thousand employees or more.\n\nOkeleji told TechCrunch the company has the \u201clargest aggregation of medium-to-very large companies in Africa.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, it plans to use its years of gathering payroll data to launch embedded finance products for employees.\n\nThe company is looking to expand into South Africa and East African countries.

Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed revealed after a Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting that Twitter and Nigeria were making headway in their negotiations.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe appreciate the patience of Nigerians. I want to assure you that we have made very tremendous progress. We have met with Twitter both physically and in writing. We are actually almost there.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the conditions to lift the suspension include Twitter registering as a company in Nigeria and appointing a country representative who would act as a liaison between the company and the Federal Government.\n\nHowever, in this article, we examine the repercussions of Twitter succumbing to Twitter\u2019s conditions.

          "text": "Crude oil prices have been forecasted to fall from 2021 levels on the back of a shift from global petroleum inventory declines during 2021 to inventory increases in the current year and next, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) for January.\n\nAccording to the document, the price of Brent crude oil, the international pricing benchmark which in the fourth quarter of 2021, averaged $79 per barrel is expected to see an average $75/b in 2022 and $68/b in 2023.\n\nSimilarly, EIA monthly data also showed that the U.S. benchmark, WTI Crude, is expected to average $71.32 per barrel this year and $63.50 a barrel next year.\n\n\u201cThe declining prices are driven by a shift from global petroleum inventory declines during 2021 to inventory increases in 2022 and 2023. Global petroleum inventories decline when consumption is greater than production and increase when production is greater than consumption,\u201d the monthly report states.\n\nIn 2021, global petroleum inventories were drained at a rate of 1.4 million barrels per day (b/d), contributing to higher crude oil prices, it recalled.\n\nHowever, after the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, petroleum consumption returned faster than petroleum production, resulting in this inventory draw.\n\nNoting this, the EIA has anticipated an increase in petroleum production and a slowing of consumption growth in 2022, resulting in an increase in global petroleum inventories.\n\nRead also: Oil climbs to two-month high over falling US inventory\n\nAlso, the global petroleum production will increase by 5.5 million b/d in 2022, driven by production increases in the United States, OPEC, and Russia, which together account for 84 percent, or 4.6 million b/d, of the growth, according to the report.\n\nIt was also projected that increased tight oil production in the United States and gradually increasing crude oil production from OPEC+ (which includes OPEC members and Russia) will account for most of the increased crude oil production.\n\nWhile giving a breakdown, the STEO also forecasted that global petroleum consumption will increase by 3.6 million b/d in 2022, driven by more consumption in the United States and China, which together account for 39 percent of the consumption growth.\n\nIn addition, global petroleum inventories will increase by 0.5 million b/d in 2022, which will put downward pressure on crude oil prices.\n\nFurthermore, 2023 is expected to witness continued inventory growth, averaging 0.6 million b/d while global petroleum production was projected to increase by 1.8 million b/d in 2023 from 2022, averaging 102.8 million b/d, the EIA analysis showed.",

The report quoted the mining minister as having confirmed the interest which could pivotal for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey are looking at the possibility of coming to look at opportunities in Nigeria,\u201d Olamilekan Adegbite said in an interview at a mining conference in Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital, Riyadh.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous nation is hoping investors will follow the example of Thor Explorations Ltd., which has built the country\u2019s first industrial gold project, as it seeks to cut its dependence on oil earnings.\n\nVancouver-based Thor poured first gold from its mine in southwestern Nigeria in July last year and is targeting output of 85,000 ounces a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so happy and delighted because they have succeeded and so give the right signal for investors,\u201d Adegbite said.\n\nRead also: Global oil, gas investment projected to grow by $26bn in 2022\n\nToronto-based Barrick, the world\u2019s second biggest gold miner, is among the firms \u201cinterested in coming to Nigeria,\u201d while the government \u201chas spoken with\u201d London-based Rio, the top iron ore producer, about opportunities in the country, Adegbite said without providing additional details.\n\nThe government intends to auction rights to mine gold, lithium, copper and limestone later this year, he said.\n\nBarrick and Rio didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most populous nation has sizeable reserves of metals including gold, zinc, lead and iron ore, but nearly all extraction is done informally with rudimentary equipment. Before Thor\u2019s launch, the contribution of mining to gross domestic product stood at less than 0.1%.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, mining made up 4% to 5% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, before major operations shut down and crude oil came to dominate the government\u2019s agenda.\n\nGold smuggling has also been a problem, with much of it destined for Dubai, according to Adegbite, who is seeking help from authorities in the United Arab Emirates to stem the flow.\n\n\u201cWe are in discussion with the UAE government to stop such practices,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting some traction.\u201d\n\nSuccessive Nigerian governments have pledged to significantly increase mining\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product, which currently stands at less than 0.1%.\n\nThe current government which hopes to be the first to actually accomplish this, is promoting Thor\u2019s launch to spur investment in the mining sector and boost non-oil income.",

          "title": "Nigeria stocks to watch in 2022",
          "text": "The year 2021 was a roller-coaster for equities, with eight months of positive returns and four month of bearish season. The market ended with a positive return of 6.7 percent amid a remarkable last-minute rally that helped push the value of listed stocks up by N1.23 trillion.\n\nInterestingly, market liquidity and the record rally were driven majorly by domestic institutional and retail investors, thus reinforcing the potential of Nigerian investors in stabilising and growing the market.\n\nNotwithstanding imminent risks to equity market rally in 2022, Nigerian stocks are still attractive and should remain resilient in this year.\n\nThe big question now is: what stocks should investors buy in 2022? Stocks seen reoccurring in many analysts BUY lists for 2022, which investors should actively consider in their equities portfolio this year include Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, GTCO, Nestle Nigeria, Zenith Bank, BUA Cement, BUA Foods, UBA, Fidelity Bank, Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC Holdings, and Flour Mills of Nigeria.\n\nCurrently in the Nigerian market, many of these stocks are undervalued and present attractive BUY opportunities for investors seeking both capital appreciation and for long-term returns.\n\n\u201cCompanies such as Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria, GTCO, Nestle and Zenith Bank, which are our top picks, are resilient bellwethers with the history of sustaining earnings growth through political cycles,\u201d according to Isaac Olorungbon, chief executive, Deep Trust and Investments Limited.\n\nHe remains upbeat on the prospect of the Nigerian stock market in 2022, \u201cas our cautious optimism reinforces our outlook of another positive return for Nigerian equity investors in the new year.\u201d\n\nOthers are: Unilever Nigeria, Okomu Oil Palm, Presco, Vitafoam, Berger Paints, Ardova, Seplat, and Total Energies Marketing Nigeria. Also on analysts BUY list are Dangote Sugar Refinery, Guinness Nigeria, Conoil, FCMB Group, May & Baker, Fidson Healthcare, and Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAmid increasing optimism in the market, a likely modest rise in the interest rate environment may undermine funds flow to equities in 2022, but a positive earnings outlook across most largely capitalised value stocks should reinforce the investment opportunities in these stocks.\n\nDangote Cement\n\nDangote Cement is Africa\u2019s leading cement producer with existing operations in 10 African countries with a production capacity of 48.6 million tons per year. The company\u2019s share price as of January 10, 2022, was N260 per share; year-to-date (YtD) change (+1.2%), while in year 2021 the stock rose by +4.9 percent.\n\nMeristem analysts target price (TP) for Dangote Cement is N287.81; Vetiva analysts target price for the stock is N280; while United Capital analysts target price is N270.3. Going by these analysts 2022 target price for the cement maker, the stock has upside potential and should be considered a BUY.\n\nBUY rating is given to a stock considered highly undervalued, but with strong fundamentals, and where potential return in excess of or equal to 15 percent is expected to be realised between its current price and analysts\u2019 target price (TP).\n\nAhead of its full year (FY) 2021 results, its unaudited interim financial statements for nine months ended September 30, 2021, showed revenue grew to N1.022 trillion as against N761.44 billion 2021. Pre-tax profit for the nine months period was N405.487 billion as against N271.960 billion in 9M\u20192020.\n\nEarnings per share increased to N16.23 in 9M\u201921 from N12.2 in 9M\u201920. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries is to operate plants for the preparation, manufacture, and distribution of cement and related products. Sector (Industrial Goods), Sub-Sector (Building Materials), Market Classification (Premium Board), and Shares Outstanding (17,040,507,405 units).\n\nRead also: Sanwo-Olu, MTN Nigeria, Osimhen, Ndidi among nominees for Nigeria Pitch Awards\n\nMTN Nigeria\n\nMTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN) is engaged in the business of building and operating Global System for Mobiles (GSM) cellular network systems and other related services.\n\nNigeria\u2019s largest telco did a public offer of its shares from December 1 to December 14, 2021, which allowed retail investors to purchase up to 575 million shares at N169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the secondary market.\n\nAs of January 10, 2022, its share price of N185.5 per share represented a negative return of 5.8 percent YtD. The stock rose by 16 percent in the year 2021. In November 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria gave it an approval-in-principle to operate a payment service bank (PSB).\n\n\u201cGoing into 2022, we believe that MTNN\u2019s 4G coverage will continue to be expansive, as it strives to meet the ever growing data needs of Nigeria\u2019s population. Thus data revenue is projected to come in at N647 billion, up 25 percent year-on-year (y/y).\n\n\u201cGiven that the NCC has lifted the suspension of new SIM card registrations, and with the company also hinting that it is actively ramping up new-registration centres, which will support the FG\u2019s NIN enrolment programme, we expect to see some gains in MTNN\u2019s subscriber base going forward. Thus, we expect this to somewhat provide a support system for voice revenue through 2022. However, we also bear in mind that voice services are subject to stiff competition, given the growing preference for internet-driven cheaper substitutes.\n\n\u201cWith the company now underway to getting a PSB licence, product offerings are up for a full-blown scale-up, and we might start to see considerable impact on MTN\u2019s top-line performance,\u201d according to Victoria Ejugwu, oil & gas, telecom\u2019s analyst at Lagos-based Vetiva.\n\n\u201cGoing forward into the 2022, we are guided by our recent Nigerian telecom sector report \u2018Delivering a Digital Future,\u2019 December 30, in which we recommend a BUY for MTNN with target price of N266.17/share and a Sell for Airtel Africa with a target price of N793.84/share,\u201d according to Coronation Research analysts in their January 4 note.\n\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of MTNN for the nine months period ended September 30, 2021, showed that its revenue grew to N1.206 trillion from 9M\u20192020 level of N975.764 billion, up by 23.62 percent.\n\nIts profit before tax (PBT) in 9M\u201921 went up to N321.352 billion from N211.594 billion in 9M\u20192020, up by 51.87 percent; while its basic/diluted earnings per share increased to N10.82 from N7.09 in 9M\u20192020, up by 52.74 percent.\n\nSector: (ICT); Sub Sector (Telecommunications Services); Market Classification (Premium Board) and Shares Outstanding (20,354,513,050 units).\n\nSeplat Energy\n\nSeplat Energy is a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and London Stock Exchange. The company believes that the greatest opportunity ahead of it is to supply the right mix of energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and rapidly growing population and drive Nigeria\u2019s transition to cleaner, more affordable energy that is accessible to all. Seplat closed the year 2021 at N650 per share, up by 61.6 percent in 2021.\n\nAs of January 10, the stock price at N665 represents an increase of 2.3 percent YtD. In its unaudited results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, it grew revenue to N182.7 billion from N135.6 billion in 9M\u20192020.\n\nGross profit went up to N58.1 billion in 9M\u201921 from N31.7 billion in 9M\u201920. Pre-tax profit grew to N38.6 billion from loss before tax of N45.5 billion in 9M\u20192020. For Seplat, ANOH project remains on track for first gas in H1\u2019 2022.\n\n\u201cA strong step forward will be when we bring on stream the ANOH project in 2022 delivering more transition gas to an energy poor market, over reliant on expensive, high carbon-emitting electricity generated from small-scale diesel and PMS generators,\u201d said Roger Brown, CEO of Seplat Energy.\n\nUnited Capital target price for Seplat is N770.4 with BUY rating. Meristem target price is N754.42 supported with BUY rating. Vetiva also rated the stock a BUY with 2022 target price at N796.57.\n\n\u201cRecently, Seplat announced that the company was in discussions for a possible acquisition of some shallow water assets from ExxonMobil. Given that details of the acquisition are yet to be released to the public, we have not included the potential impact on the valuation of Seplat.\n\n\u201cHowever, should the deal materialises, we expect to see an increase in crude output, while we expect cost synergies to result from the integration of administrative operations for the combined entity,\u201d said Luke Ofojebe, Vetiva\u2019s head of research.\n\nSector (Oil & Gas); Sub Sector (Exploration and Production); Market Classification (Premium Board); and Shares Outstanding (588,444,561 units).\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria, one of Nigeria\u2019s leading food and agro-allied groups, remains committed to executing its overall long-term strategy aimed at maintaining growth and sustaining profitability.\n\nRecently, Flour Mills of Nigeria and Honeywell Group Limited agreed to combine operations of FMN through its affiliates and Honeywell Flour Mills (HFMP), a portfolio company of HGL, at a total enterprise value of N80 billion, which will make Honeywell Group dispose of a 71.69 percent stake in HFMP to FMN.\n\nThe proposed transaction will combine two businesses with shared goals and create a more resilient national champion in the Nigerian foods industry, ensuring long-term job creation and preservation.\n\nA combination of FMN and HFMP will bring together two trusted and iconic brands, creating a food business that is better positioned to benefit the growing Nigerian population, further enhance national food security objectives and leverage opportunities stemming from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nFlour Mills was among best performing stocks in 2021 (+183.3%). In the trading week ended January 7, 2022, the share price of Flour Mills of Nigeria closed at N29 per share, representing an increase of 2.3 percent YtD.\n\nIn half-year (H1) (2021/2022), the Group revenue was N522.8 billion, compared to N355.1 billion in H1 2020/21, which represents 47 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth. Performance was consistent across all key business segments in the group with agro-allied and support segments in particular showing impressive growth by as much as 35 percent. In the review H1 period, the Group\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) was N15.5 billion, compared to N14.6 billion in H1 2020/21 (6% \u2013 YoY growth).\n\nThis performance was underpinned by continued strong operating performance in the food segment; continuous improvement in agro-allied and support segments. The Group\u2019s PAT was N10.5 billion, compared to N9.9 billion in H1 2020/21 (6% \u2013 YoY growth). The Group\u2019s solid operational performance was stimulated by strong organic growth, supported by product innovation, and continued momentum in retail sales.\n\nThe stock had on January 10 decreased this year by 0.9 percent. United Capital research analysts say Flour Mills is a BUY considering their target price of N46.6 for the stock. Meristem also wants investors to buy Flour Mills considering their target price of N40.63.\n\nMeristem research analysts in their January 10 stock recommendation urged investors to \u201cBUY\u201d Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc shares. Also, Vetiva\u2019s price target for Flour Mills is N44.34,\u201d said its consumer goods analyst, Chinma Ukadike.\n\n\u201cWe note that the company\u2019s volume growth strategy has been quite successful so far, across its Food and Agro-allied segments. In line with this, we remain positive on the impact of newer product roll-out expected in the coming quarters,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nSector (Consumer Goods); Sub Sector (Food Products); Market Classification (Main Board); Shares Outstanding (4,100,379,605 units).",
          "summary": "Notwithstanding imminent risks to equity market rally in 2022, Nigerian stocks are still attractive and should remain resilient in this year.\nThe big question now is: what stocks should investors buy in 2022?\nMeristem analysts target price (TP) for Dangote Cement is N287.81; Vetiva analysts target price for the stock is N280; while United Capital analysts target price is N270.3.\nGoing by these analysts 2022 target price for the cement maker, the stock has upside potential and should be considered a BUY.\nVetiva also rated the stock a BUY with 2022 target price at N796.57.",

          "text": "Governor Bello Mohammed of Zamfara State has called for more concerted efforts in fighting banditry to ensure speedy elimination of the menace in the entire North West region and beyond.\n\nMohammed made the appeal yesterday in Gusau, the state capital when a team from President Muhammad Buhari paid him a condolence visit over the loss of lives in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas. The victims were killed by fleeing bandits following intense operations by troops and aerial attacks.\n\nTo hasten the success of the ongoing operations in the state, Governor Matawalle called on the federal government to deploy more interventions in the state including more Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and specifically, the Super Tucano fighter jets in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs part of this strategy, special forces should be deployed to some blackspots, particularly identified to be more dangerous centres of activities of the bandits. These blackspots are Gando, in Bukkuyum local government area, Munhaye of Tsafe local government area, Bayan Ruwa, in Maradun local government area, Kabaro- Sangeku, of Dansadau and Magami axis. The special forces could help dislodge the bandits and block exits to the fleeing ones.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe security challenge in Zamfara State and other states in the North West is unprecedented. It has become an existential threat for the sub region. We have virtually explored and tried all workable options in our relentless effort to address this challenge. We tried the dialogue mechanism, which has worked for some time before deliberate efforts by some misguided politicians to scuttle the process.\u201d\n\nThe governor said his administration has, however, tried to surmount the challenges in many faces. \u201cMy administration has made tackling the issue of insecurity its priority. Our approach is multifaceted. We have intermarried the provision of logistics and other forms of support to our security forces with an array of social intervention programmes aimed at the economic empowerment of our youths,\u201d he said.\n\nMatawalle suggested that the idea of Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs\u2019) Camps should be de-emphasised while concerted efforts at quick resettlement should be stressed through massive provision of resources by the federal and state governments and all stakeholders such as NGOs, donor agencies and profit-making organisations and individuals\n\nGovernor Matawalle further added that his administration has been supporting the security operatives in the state to make their job easier, \u201cwe procured 200 brand new Hilux pickups and distributed them to all the security agencies in the State for operational purposes. This is in addition to payment of allowances to security personnel, provision of Silent Falcon Drones, repairs of vehicles and fighting equipment, provision of office and housing accommodation and a host of other supports to our security forces\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said, \u201cWe employed the service of hunters and provided them with motorcycles and allowances. Only recently we paid the service hunters the sum of N53 million, in addition to their full upkeep. In the aftermath of the recent attacks in Anka and Bukkuyum local government Areas, we expanded the sum of N250 million to provide vehicles, and allowances for both the Civilian JTF and the conventional security outfits\u2019 \u2018. Governor Matawalle added.\n\nEarlier, the Leader of the delegation and minister of defence, Major-General Bashir Salihi Magashi (rtd), told the governor that his team was in Gusau to extend the message of Buhari over the recent unfortunate attacks on some communities in the state.\n\nMagashi said the president is saddened with the development and promises that stronger action would be taken to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents in the future.",

          "title": "ISWAP Attacks On The Rise, Governor Zulum Cries Out",
          "text": "Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum yesterday raised fresh concerns over the increasing activities of the Islamic State of West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists in the core and northern parts of the state.\n\nRevealing that two local government areas of the state, Guzamala and Abadam, are still being controlled by the terrorists, Zulum claimed that ISWAP terrorists are better equipped, better trained and more sophisticated than the defunct Boko Haram terrorists led by the late Abubakar Shekau, hence the need for the Nigerian military to be more decisive in dealing with them.\n\nThe Borno State governor\u2019s comments are at variance with the claims by President Muhammadu Buhari during his recent interviews on local television that no part of Nigerian territory is under the control of terrorists.\n\nThe president\u2019s assertion is also in spite of recent reports that terrorists in some states in the North West were collecting levies and taxes from locals before allowing them to have access to their farms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZulum, who disclosed this when a delegation of the Senate Committee on Army led by Senator Ali Ndume and Senator Lekan Balogun paid a courtesy at his Council Chamber in Maiduguri, further said that ISWAP terrorists were having checkpoints in Damboa and Biu local government areas of the state and collecting taxes from communities.\n\nHe berated Senator Ali Ndume for criticising the surrendering terrorists despite the fact that he, Ndume, cannot go to his hometown in Gwoza without escort, adding that the senator\u2019s community of Hambagda in Gwoza local government area had been deserted by his people due to the activities of the terrorists.\n\nZulum further stated that ISWAP terrorists had been growing in stature and making things very difficult, noting that the major problem with the Army was that when peace begins to return, the troops will relax, allowing the terrorists to regroup and take the initiative.\n\nHence, the governor urged the troops to always be on the offensive and pursue the terrorists to their enclaves.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZulum said, \u201cISWAP terrorists are having checkpoints between Damboa and Biu local government areas, collecting taxes from the communities. Few days ago, I got security report that ISWAP terrorists are holding a marriage ceremony in one of the communities with the presence of over 300 motorcycles.\n\n\u201cI only have one discrepancy with Senator Ali Ndume. I heard him criticising the repentant terrorists and I felt that this should not had come from someone from Borno. We know where we were before now. Ndume cannot go to his hometown without security escort.\n\n\u201cNdume\u2019s hometown Hambagda has been deserted. Ninety-five percent of them cannot go to their farms, but the situation is different since we started witnessing the surrender of the terrorists. Areas under cultivation have increased. \u201d\n\nThe governor added that over 20,000 members of the Boko Haram terrorists had surrendered out of which 5,000 of them were fighters. No magic can be done in this war if not supported with dialogue.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that two local government areas, Guzamala and Abadam, are still under the control of the terrorists, and called for them to be retrieved from the grip of ISWAP.\n\n\u201cAnother issue is that two of our local government areas are still under the control of the terrorists. We want to see these two local government areas taken over by the owner, that is the government of Borno and the local government authorities,\u201d the governor added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nZulum, however, thanked the army for restoring peace in the state even as he urged the troops to do more to stop the activities of ISWAP terrorists so that people can go back and have their livelihood.\n\nIn his speech, the leader of the delegation, Senator Ali Ndume, said that the committee was in the state to carry out its oversight functions on the army commands.\n\nHe said despite the successes of the military, they are facing some difficulties such as poor welfare of personnel and paucity of funding, among others.\n\nAt the headquarters of the Theater Command, Operation Hadin Kai, at Maimalari Cantonment in Maiduguri, Ndume commended the successes recorded by the Nigerian military in the Northeast.\n\nThe Senator, who led members of the Senate Committee on Army, who were in Borno State on an oversight function at the Command, assured the troops of the continuous support of the National Assembly and federal government toward protecting the sovereignty and integrity of the country.\n\nLamenting the poor living conditions of the soldiers, Senator Ndume disclosed that N17 trillion had been budgeted for the Nigerian military to enhance their welfare and operations.\n\nHe, however, called on the troops to check the activities of terrorists in the Borno State and North East region.\n\nIn a related development, the Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna, Most Rev. Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso, yesterday expressed worry at the rising insecurity in the country.\n\nThe archbishop, while speaking to journalists in Kaduna, noted that the primary function of every government is to secure the life and property of its citizens.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari should sit up to ensure that Nigerians are safe in their homes and places of work. Our government needs to do something,\u201d he said, adding that Nigerians can no longer sleep with their two eyes closed, with people being killed every day.\n\nGunmen Kill 18 People In Plateau Village\n\nMeanwhile, the Special Task Force in charge of security in Plateau, Bauchi and some part of Southern Kaduna state, code-named Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) has confirmed the killing of 18 persons in a fresh attack in Ancha village of Bassa Local Government Council by unknown gunmen.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that the gunmen stormed the community early in the morning and started shooting sporadically. It was further gathered that several houses were razed down by the rampaging gunmen.\n\nThe OPSH, in a statement signed by the military information officer, Major Ishaku Takwa, said troops of OPSH received a distress call of an attack on Ancha Community in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau in the late hours of Tuesday, January 11, 2022,.\n\nAccording to him, troops responded swiftly and mobilised to the village but that on reaching the community, the attackers had fled the village.\n\nHe said houses were destroyed and some villagers lost their lives during the attack, adding that troops were on the trail of the assailants and details of the pursuit would be made available later.\n\nMajor Takwa further said the Commander OPSH, Maj Gen IS Ali, while commiserating with the families of those who lost their lives during the attack, reiterated his resolve to ensure the perpetrators of evil on the Plateau face the consequences of their dastard acts, the statement added.\n\nAlso, the leadership of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has expressed shock over the unfortunate attack that led to the alleged killings of 18 persons at Ancha village of Bassa LGA.\n\nAccording to a statement signed and issued by the chairman of MACBAN in Plateau State, Muhammad Nuru Abdullahi, while the group condemned the said attack, it, however, frowns at the allegation labelled against Fulani people \u2013 that they carried out the attack which led to the death of 18 people.\n\n\u201cWe see this allegation by the national publicity of Irigwe Development Association, Malison David, as absolute falsehood, that lacks merit and is more of hype than substance,\u201d MACBAN said.\n\nOur correspondent recalls that Irigwe People had accused the Fulani of attacking their villages and killing and burning houses in the process .\n\nThe state governor, Simon Lalong, expressed deep sadness over the attack which left many dead and properties destroyed.\n\nLalong in a statement signed by his director of press and public affairs, Simon Macham, said the attack of Tuesday night was another sad tale in the unending cycle of violent attacks in the area which had continued despite several measures taken by the government to stop them.\n\nHe ordered security agencies to ensure that they fish out the attackers at all costs, as bringing such perpetrators to justice is the only way to halt the barbaric killings.\n\nThe governor asked the GOC 3rd Armoured Division and Commander of Operation Safe Haven, the Commissioner of Police, Department of State Services, Operation Rainbow and other security organs in the state to utilise intelligence available from survivors and other sources and ensure that the perpetrators of this and other attacks are apprehended and exposed.\n\n8,372 Killed, 5,018 Abducted In 2021 \u2013 Report\n\nNon-state actors killed 8,372 Nigerians and abducted 5,018 others across the country between January 01 and December 31, 2021, according to report by Beacon Consulting Limited.\n\nThe report tagged \u2018Nigeria Security Report December 2021\u2019 and obtained by LEADERSHIP said the North suffered the most deaths with 79.2 percent in the period under review, which shows the region is bleeding.\n\nA breakdown of these fatalities, according to the geopolitical regions, shows that the North West suffered the highest with 3,051 deaths, followed by the North East with 1,895 casualties, North Central \u2013 1,684 victims, South East \u2013 853, South-South \u2013 448, and South West \u2013 441.\n\nThe breakdown further shows that 36.4 percent of the yearly fatality figures affected the North West region, 22.6 percent affected the North East and 20.1 percent, North Central, putting the total percentage of fatalities for Northern Nigeria at 79.2%\u201d\n\nThe report shows that 1,516 deaths were recorded across the country in the 4th quarter of 2021 alone.\n\nA breakdown of these deaths according to geopolitical regions shows that the North West suffered the highest with 673, followed by the North East with 413 casualties, North Central with 235 victims, South East with 114, South West with 51 and South-South, 30.\n\n\u201cIn addition, an analysis of the states most affected by the fatalities shows they spread across 31 states and the FCT, with Borno State recording the highest fatalities at 1,508 deaths. Our incident tracker did not record any confirmed fatality associated with the threat elements we monitored in Bauchi, Bayelsa, Ekiti, Jigawa and Kano states,\u201d it said.\n\nThe report indicates that in 2021, 5,018 abductions were recorded across the country.\n\nThe breakdown shows that the North West suffered the highest with 3101 incidents, followed by the North Central with 1082, North East with 276 victims, South-South with 245, South West with 223 and South East, 91.\n\n\u201cThe breakdown further shows that 61.8 percent of the yearly abduction figures affected the North West region, 21.6 percent in the North Central and 5.5 percent in the North East. This puts the total percentage of kidnapping incidents in northern Nigeria for January \u2013 December 2021, at 88.9 percent.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, government efforts led to a consecutive month-to-month reduction of security incidents and fatalities, but not kidnapping as 574 cases, representing a 58 percent month-to-month increase, was recorded in December 2021.\n\nFor the month of December, the firm recorded a diverse range of security incidents and 431 deaths in 29 states across 96 LGAs.\n\nA breakdown of these incidents shows that 26 percent occurred in the North West geopolitical region, 19 percent in North Central, 17 percent in South West, and 13 percent each in South-South and South-East and 12 percent North East.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe thematic indications of the incidents that resulted in these fatalities include mostly armed attacks and a continuation of the trend of several non-state actors successfully challenging the state\u2019s monopoly of the use of force.\u201d\n\nOn North East, the report observed continued armed conflicts between government security forces, codenamed Operation Hadin Kai, and several non-state actors including the Islamist jihadist groups, the Jamatus Ahlis Sunna lil dawatil wal Jihad (Boko Haram) and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), mostly affecting parts of northern Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.\n\nThe report for December 2021 observed attempts by ISWAP to maintain territorial control, including setting up illegal checkpoints on travel routes where they targetted commuters, and an increased interdiction attacks by the security forces with a noticeable improvement in the Nigeria Airforce support and response capabilities, leading to more effective repelling of Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters\u2019 attacks and destruction of their platforms.\n\nThe report further indicates series of clashes between Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters, the use of anti-aircraft weapons, artillery mortar fire and rocket launchers by ISWAP using improvised platforms to effect long-range attacks but with little accuracy in their targeting,\n\nBandits Kidnap More Traders On Kaduna Road\n\nAnother set of traders travelling to Kano from Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, were reportedly abducted by bandits yesterday.\n\nThe bandits were said to have blocked the highway between Birnin Gwari and Kaduna at Unguwar Yako forest where they abducted the traders, whose number is not yet known.\n\nAlthough the spokesperson to Kaduna State Police Command, ASP Muhammad Jailge could not be reached on his phone to confirm the incidence, a source who prefers anonymity said the victims were likely on a business trip and moving from Birnin Gwari axis to Kano before they were kidnapped.\n\nHe said,\u201dWe spotted four empty vehicles and they said an unspecified number of persons moving from Birnin-Gwari axis to Kano have been kidnapped,\u201d he said.\n\nFor several years now, the Birnin-Gwari road has remained a hot spot for kidnappers and bandits who terrorise travellers passing the route.\n\nRecently, bandits have twice kidnapped traders along the same route.\n\nPMB Reiterates Commitment To End Banditry\n\nMeanwhile, responding to the recent killing of scores of Zamfara residents, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday conveyed his condolences and that of his government to the people of the state on what he called the \u201cextremely unfortunate\u201d mass killings of innocent people by retreating bandits.\n\nThe president, who described the recent incident as a very sad one for the nation, reiterated his earlier commitment to tackle the monster of terrorism head-on, giving assurances that the besieged communities and other Nigerians will not be abandoned to their fate.\n\nIn an address to the governor, commissioners, Emirs, the Chief Judge and Grand Khadi, legislators, council chairmen and political leaders, President Buhari, who was represented by a delegation led by the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd), expressed the strong determination of the administration to get rid of the bandits who have now been classified as terrorists.\n\n\u201cThere will be no let-up in the ongoing campaign to rid Zamfara and other affected states of the menace of these terrorists. Since they have no regard for the sanctity of life, so shall they be dealt with.\n\n\u201cThe government is fully informed of what is going on and will do whatever it takes to end this (carnage). We are here to talk to the governor and to assure the state that the administration is determined to do more to defend the life and property of the people,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nPresident Buhari condoled with the government and the people of the state over the losses of life and directed the military and other security agencies to intensify the ongoing campaign until everyone and everywhere is safe.\n\nThe governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Bello Matawalle, who welcomed the delegation, said the visit was a testimony to the strong support of the President and the government at the centre.\n\nHe appreciated the wisdom and vision of the president in approving the ongoing military campaign in the state, the effect of which has led to the dismantling of terrorists\u2019 hideouts used as launchpads for kidnapping, rustling and terrorism. He, however, said more still needs to be done.\n\nHe called on the federal government to fortify the security of the state with additional Armored Personnel Carriers, APCs, and to roll out a special intervention fund for Zamfara and other states equally affected by the scourge of insecurity.\n\nSecurity Tops NASS 2022 Agenda\n\nThe Senate president, Ahmad Lawan, has said the National Assembly in 2022 will focus on security through oversight of funds appropriated in this year\u2019s budget to the armed forces and other security agencies.\n\nHe said doing so would guarantee transparency in the procurement process and ensure the welfare of military and security personnel tasked with restoring security across parts of the country.\n\nLawan made these comments yesterday when the Senate Press Corps paid a visit to felicitate with him on the occasion of his 63rd birthday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThat takes me to the challenge for the National Assembly, particularly the Senate in 2022. So far, we have done over ninety percent of what we set for ourselves in our legislative agenda, but because the country and people are dynamic, we have so many other things to do.\n\n\u201cToday, the security situation still begs for more attention. We will give a lot of attention to the security situation. We have appropriated about a trillion for our security agencies and armed forces, now it is for members of the National Assembly to ensure that the procurement process by the armed forces is transparent and everybody there is accountable.\n\n\u201c[And} of course, we should do oversight as much as possible on the welfare of our soldiers and security personnel. They need to continuously be motivated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate president added that the upper chamber would also, in the first-quarter of this year, focus on addressing the challenges of revenue generation, collection and remittance to shore up earnings by the federal government.\n\nHe said Nigerians will remember the Ninth Assembly under his leadership for its outstanding legislative achievements after the end of its lifespan in June 2023.",

Thereafter, the president constituted a seven-man Presidential Committee to engage Twitter Inc.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD ALSO : Twitter Suspended Over Fake News, Not Buhari Alone \u2013 Presidency\n\n\u201cSubsequently, in its wisdom, the Presidential Committee set a 20-member Technical Committee comprising all relevant government agencies. The Technical Committee engaged and worked directly with the Twitter team.\n\nAccording to the statement, the immediate and remote cause of the suspension was the unceasing use of the platform by some unscrupulous elements for subversive purposes and criminal activities, propagating fake news, and polarising Nigerians along tribal and religious lines, among others, which bordered on national security and cohesion, adding that the effects of the abuse of the Twitter platform forced the federal government to suspend the operation of Twitter to address the direct and collateral issues around its operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt added that the new global reality was that digital platforms and their operators wield enormous influence over the fabric of society, social interaction and economic choices, hence these platforms can be used as tools or weapons.\n\nThe government said further in the statement that every nation is grappling with how to balance its usage efficiently, noting that without balancing, every citizen\u2019s security, privacy, social well-being, and development are at stake.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTherefore, our action is a deliberate attempt to recalibrate our relationship with Twitter to achieve the maximum mutual benefits for our nation without jeopardising the justified interests of the company.

We are also conscious of the times\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: After Tinubu, Umahi Informs Buhari Of Presidential Ambition\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother presidential hopeful on the platform of APC, Senator Rochas Okorocha, said he was not in a rush to formally declare his intention.\n\nSpeaking through his media aide, Sam Onwuemodo, Okorocha said there is no rush to make declarations because other people have.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own programme which they are working with. There is no need to rush because some others have. Let\u2019s keep our fingers crossed and watch what happens. That is what I can say\u201d, Onwuemodo said.\n\nHe refused to give an insight into their plans, saying events will unfold.\n\nOkorocha had last week Wednesday while reacting to the failure of Governor Hope Uzodimma to name sponsors of criminality in Imo State, said he would contest the presidency of the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said Uzodimma was against him because of his presidential ambition.\n\nHowever, former presidential candidate in 2019 and business mogul, Olawepo-Hassim, will declare his ambition after the national convention.\n\nAn authoritative source within his camp said the presidential hopeful will make his ambition known after the APC national convention.\n\nThe source said, \u201cBy the Grace of God after the APC national convention.\u201d\n\nIn the PDP, the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is expected to formally declare his intention in the first quarter of this year.\n\nHowever, a top source in former Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki\u2019s camp dismissed claims that Saraki had declared for the seat last November during his visit to the governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, in Makurdi.\n\nThe source said the former Senate president is yet to make a formal declaration, explaining that what happened in Makurdi wasn\u2019t a formal declaration.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere was no declaration when Dr. Saraki met Governor Ortom. He only went to consult the governor on his ambition and the governor said he had scheduled a meeting of party leaders who were already waiting for him.\n\n\u201cHe then said Dr. Saraki should accompany him to the meeting so that he can tell the party leaders in Benue why he came to see him. That actually is not the way a man of Dr. Saraki\u2019s calibre will declare presidential ambition. When it is time to formally declare his ambition, everybody in the country will know\u201d.\n\nSo far, those who have formally declared their intention formally are Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa and former Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nMeanwhile, former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof Kingsley Moghalu, was the first to openly declare his presidential ambition.\n\nThe 2019 presidential candidate of Young Peoples Party (YPP) has since pitched his political tent with the African Democratic Congress (ADC) ahead of the 2023 contest.",

Reuters was not able to independently verify this.\n\nThe first Group F game, between Mali and Tunisia, went ahead on Wednesday with Mali winning 1-0, and the match between Gambia and Mauritania got underway as planned.\n\nMilitias from the minority English-speaking west have been fighting since 2017 in protest against what they say is their marginalisation by the French-speaking government.\n\nThe conflict has killed at least 3,000 people and forced nearly one million to flee. Separatist and government forces have both been accused of abuses against civilians.\n\nHenry Kemende, a prominent local senator, was shot dead on Tuesday by unknown assailants in Bamenda, the capital of the neighbouring North West region, his party said.",

          "text": "The declaration by Bola Ahmed Tinubu on the 2023 presidential election has halted all momentum in Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s camp, DAILY POST gathered.\n\nTinubu, the national leader of the APC and godfather of the Vice President, on Monday, declared his intention to run after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn a press briefing after the meeting, Tinubu said the ambition to be the president of Nigeria has been a lifelong ambition.\n\nSources in Osinbajo\u2019s camp told DAILY POST that the move by Tinubu has temporarily halted the underground mobilization that is ongoing.\n\n\u201cOnce baba had indicated interest, there is no need to contemplate running for the office,\u201d the source told DAILY POST.\n\nBefore the announcement by Tinubu, Osinbajo was in a strong momentum. In December, former military president, Ibrahim Babangida had given some sort of endorsement. \u201cI want you to tell him to stay on cause,\u201d IBB had said.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Dr Umar Farouk Umar, also had glowing remarks about the Vice President during the turbaning of Yusuf Buhari in Daura.\n\nThat was not the first time the Emir of Daura would be paying glowing remarks on Osinbajo. In 2018, the monarch said, \u201cI can assure you that our son has enormous trust in you, I want you to continue to justify that confidence he reposed in you.\u201d\n\nEqually, despite the romance between Tinubu and Governor Umar Guanduje of Kano State, Kawu Hafiz, a member of the House of Representatives from Kano State also openly endorsed the aspiration of Osinbajo.\n\nThe Osibanjo Grassroot Organization had been moving around the country to solicit support for the former Attorney General of Lagos State.\n\nIn one fell swoop, this momentum is under threat because of the relationship with Tinubu.\n\nLong years of loyalty to Tinubu\n\nIn 1999, Tinubu appointed Osinbajo as his Attorney General, a cabinet position that Osinbajo served in for 8years. After the administration, Osinbajo remained part of that set of politicians like Rauf Aregbasola, Babatunde Fashola, Muiz Banire, Lai Mohammed and others.\n\nFrom being commissioners, all these politicians have all been elevated to different positions and remained loyal to Tinubu. Aregbesola who was Commissioner for Works became governor of Osun State and now the Minister of Interior. Babatunde Fashola who was Chief of Staff later became Governor of Lagos State and now Minister of Works and Housing. Lai Mohammed also served as Chief of Staff and currently is the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nAfter a failed bid to join Buhari\u2019s ticket as running mate as stated in the book by Bisi Akande, \u2018My Participation\u2019, Tinubu nominated Osinbajo as running mate to Buhari.\n\nIn 2016, speaking on who nominated him, Osinbajo had said, \u201cAn APC national leader whom I had served when he was governor was interested in putting me forward as the running mate of President Muhammadu Buhari in consensus with other national leaders of the party.\u201d\n\n6 years of Loyalty to Buhari\n\nIn 2019, during the 59th Independence Day, in the \u201cThis is Nigeria\u201d magazine, Osinbajo had in a message titled \u201cUncompromised Loyalty\u201d pledged his loyalty to Buhari\n\n\u201cHe is the best boss and I find it thrilling to serve Nigeria under him. It is only responsible of me to give my unwavering loyalty to President Buhari,\u201d the VP wrote.\n\nThe level of loyalty that exists between the two was further amplified by Buhari after his death rumour\n\n\u201cPoor Professor Yemi Osinbajo, even he had to deal with the rumours. Some people reached out to him to consider them to be his vice-president because they assumed I was dead. That embarrassed him a lot; we discussed it when he visited me while I was convalescing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2018, when the President was in London for medical attention, the men of the Department of State Services (DSS) laid siege at the entrance of the National Assembly. Following the uproar, Osinbajo as the Acting President fired the once-powerful Lawal Daura.\n\nHence, when the President declared that he has a preferred candidate, but he will not mention the person, many believed it could be Osinbajo. In the aftermath of the declaration, Mr Tinubu notified Buhari of his intention to run despite claiming that he is still consulting.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi also went to Buhari to inform him that he is running.\n\nChief Segun Okunloye, a Chieftain of the APC, told DAILY POST that the campaign is all about timing and momentum. \u201cThe President\u2019s declaration of having a favourite has sped up the process.\n\n\u201cThe race to succeed Buhari is going to be about decisiveness because the APC is the biggest party currently, you can see the difficulty in even picking a date for the convention. So, politicians will have to be fast, else, you are out.\u201d",

          "title": "Zulum on insecurity: Peace has returned to 11 local government areas, 2 still under ISWAP",
          "text": "Borno state governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, has expressed concern over the increasing presence of terrorists of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) extraction in some parts of the state, and therefore called for urgent security measures to curtail the trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe governor, who acknowledged that peace had returned to 11 local government areas of the state, however, said Abadam and Guzamala local government areas were still under the control of Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThe governor spoke Wednesday when he received in audience the Senate Committee on Army, led by its Chairman, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, at the Council Chamber of the Government House Maiduguri.\n\nSpeaker of the State House of Assembly Abdulkarim Lawan had told journalists that 99% of communities in Guzamala local government area where he hails from were under the control of Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nWhile commending the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, the Nigerian Armed Forces and volunteers for major gains recorded in the state, Zulum nevertheless said he was deeply worried about the increasing presence of the ISWAP in some parts of the state, especially in southern Borno.\n\nZulum said: \u201cI am pleased to inform you that we have started witnessing gradual return of peace, but more needs to be done, because, presently, Guzamala and Abadam Local Government Areas are still under the control of Boko Haram.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough, the current Service Chiefs, the Theatre Commander, and indeed our General Officer Commanding 7 Division are up and doing. We want to commend the military and other paramilitary personnel for their gallant efforts to see to the end of terrorism in this part of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the government and people of Borno state, especially those from southern and northern parts of the state, are worried over the increasing number of ISWAP groups who have been terrorising their communities.\n\n\u201cJust few days ago, I received a security report that in some communities of Mandaragirau axis in Biu Local Government Area, there are reports that over 500 Boko Haram/ISWAP groups have been converging with over 300 motorcycles and even celebrating parties/marriages amongst themselves without confrontation.\n\n\n\n\u201cHonestly speaking, we have to do something about the operations of ISWAP in Borno State, if nothing is done to check them and chase them out, it may be bad not only for people of the North-East, but the entire nation at large.\n\n\u201cISWAP are more equipped, sophisticated, intelligent and dangerous as they grow from strength to strength. ISWAP are collecting taxes along major roads in Damboa and other axis in southern Borno. It is very unfortunate.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the good news is that about 11 local government areas of Gwoza, Bama, Marte, Monguno, Kaga, Gubio, Mafa, Dikwa, Ngala and host of others are becoming more peaceful than before, and this could be attributed to about 20,000 surrendered members of Boko Haram who are now in our custody.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to solicit for prayers from all and sundry for total restoration of peace not only in Borno state, but the country as a whole.\u201d Zulum said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Boko Haram surrender making impact\u2019\n\nGovernor Zulum also spoke about the recent surrender by hundreds of repentant Boko Haram fighters, which he said was already resulting in some stability, especially in the areas of agriculture.\n\n\n\nThe governor said since \u201cthe surrender of thousands of insurgents, farmers have increased access to farms by 70%,\u201d just as he expressed support for the \u201ccontinued combination of military warfare, and political approach towards disarmament, deradicalization and safe reintegration.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, Chairman Senate Committee on Army, Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume said they were at the Government House to commend Governor Zulum for the support rendered the Army towards restoring peace to the state and nation at large.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, this is a Senate committee on Nigerian Army, and we are here on oversight, and to thank Your Excellency for the support that you have been giving to the Army, which they themselves (Army) have acknowledged,\u201d Ndume said.\n\n\n\nOn the committee delegation were Senator Abba Moro, representing Benue South, and Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Hassan Mohammed Gusau, Senator Kola Balogun from Oyo South Senatorial district, and Senator Bulus K. Amos from Gombe South.\n\n\n\nThe committee was also accompanied on the visit by Brig. Gen. Sani Suleiman who is the Director Defense Liaison to the National Assembly, Navy Captain Shehu Mohammed Tasiu, Deputy Director Defense Liaison to the National Assembly, Lawal Sani, who is the committee\u2019s clerk, and the deputy clerk, Akikomi Babatunde Johnson.\n\nThe committee also visited the troops at the Theater Command Headquarters, Maimalari Cantonment Maiduguri to have a firsthand information on their welfare.\n\nAddressing the troops, Senator Ndume, who lauded the efforts and sacrifices of the Nigerian Army in the insurgency fight, said the military had a substantial chunk of the 2022 Budget to motivate the troops.\n\nHe urged them to further weaken the ISWAP base so the successes recorded in the insurgency fight could be properly consolidated.\n\nResponding, Theatre Commander JTF Operation Hadin Kai Theater Command Headquarters Maimalari Cantonment Maiduguri, Major Gen. Chris G. Musa appreciated the Senate committee\u2019s visit and commended Ndume for consistently making a case for the NA at both the National Assembly and Presidency.\n\nHe reassured of the theatre command\u2019s commitment and determination to bring to an end the 12-year insurgency this year 2022, noting that, no stone would be left unturned in an effort to rid the state and the region of all criminalities and insurgency.\n\nAlso at the 7 Division NA Maimalari Cantonment Maiduguri, the Acting GOC, Major-General Abdulwahab A. Eyitayo, appreciated the Senate committee members visit and appealed for more support to the Army to end the war.\n\nBandits abduct many traders\n\nMeanwhile, suspected bandits Wednesday abducted unspecified numbers of traders travelling to Kano from Birnin Gwari local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nA driver who witnessed the incident told Premium Times that the gunmen blocked the highway between Birnin Gwari and Kaduna at Unguwar Yako forest where they abducted the traders.\n\nThe source said the abducted persons were among dozens of travellers going from Birnin Gwari and neighbouring communities in Niger State to Kano on routine business trips.\n\n\u201cWe were travelling in a convoy with security escorts but they (bandits) abducted those who moved ahead of the convoy, which made them easy preys for the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe came and met about four empty vehicles, while seeing the bandits moving into the forest with the captives. The soldiers are tracing them, we are stranded at a dangerous spot in the forest (Unguwar Yako) while the security escorts are chasing to rescue the abducted traders,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe latest incident occurred less than a month after over 70 travellers were abducted along the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road in Kaduna State.\n\nThat incident on December 23, 2021 happened around Udawa village after Buruku in Chikun Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe police spokesperson in Kaduna, Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to phone calls Wednesday afternoon to comment on the incident.\n\n18 killed in fresh Plateau attack\n\nIn a related development, the national leadership of Irigwe Development Association (IDA) has said 18 people were allegedly killed in Tuesday night attack on Ancha village, Irigwe chiefdom, Bassa local government area of Plateau state.\n\nAccording to reports, the incident lasted for over two hours.\n\nGiving the statistics shortly after returning from the affected community with other officials of the association, IDA National Publicity Secretary Davidson Malison said: \u201cWhile other people celebrated the triumphant entry of the year 2022, the Rigwe people have been ushered into the year with a lot of unpleasantness and distastefulness.\n\n\u201cThis can be likened to a scenario where evil merchants have been adjured to having a field day in their attempt to achieve an agenda of Fulanization and annihilation of Rigwe ethnic nationality.\n\n\u201cThe Rigwe Nation has been visited by yet another deadly and lethal attack by Fulani Terrorists (as testified by victims that survived) in the early hours of 12 midnight of Tuesday January 11, 2022 at Ancha village of Miango District, Rigwe Chiefdom of Bassa LGA.\n\n\u201cThe attack which lasted for over 2 hours (12:00-2:30) undistracted and unchecked led to the killing of eighteen(18) people with six (6) others injured while over 24 households with over 100 residential rooms were razed down, other properties like motor vehicles, motorcycles and harvested food crops were also destroyed with many valuables stolen and carted away.\n\n\u201cSaddened to note, is that amongst those killed and roasted is a three-month old baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior to the Ancha attack, three people were ambushed on a motorcycle along Oureedam village of Kwall District on Christmas night where two people were killed instantly while one sustained gunshot injuries.\n\n\u201cOn the eve of New Year (31/12/2021) five people were attacked and ambushed at Twin Hill where one was burnt to death while four others were injured.\n\n\u201cOn the 7th of January, 2022 a 49-year-old, Timeh Evi, was ambushed and killed at his irrigation farm in Nzhwerenvi which his dead body has not been recovered till date. His motorcycle and Water pump machine were also carted away.\n\n\u201cOn the 10th of January, 2022, Ancha village was visited by another attack where a man and his wife were ambushed on their way to farm where the man died instantly while the wife was severely injured and is currently receiving treatment at a hospital.\n\n\u201cThe National Leadership of Irigwe Development Association (IDA) has lost words to convey the state of sadness, broken-heartedness and joylessness the entire nation has been confined to courtesy the act of barbarism and callousness that has been done in the land.\n\n\u201cWe have called on Security agents and Government on several occasions to devise means as well as grab the political will of ending the spate of carnage being unleashed on the Rigwe people, yet no concrete and tangible efforts have been done to corroborate our calls but, we want to reiterate that if we are part of this country and legitimate citizens, then we expect to see a proactive not reactive approach, action not condemnation, arrest not mere investigation and justice not injustice,\u201d the group further added.\n\nIDA listed the victims as \u201cGideon Goh- 30 years old, Danladi James-26 years old, Yohanna Musa- 17 years old, Achi Alhaji -16 years old, Monday Abba- 52 years old, Musa Tegwi- 80 years old, Christiana Sunday -45; years old, Laraba Bitrus- 38 years old, Andrew Bitrus \u2013 7 years old, Wiki Bitrus \u2013 5 years old, Monday Bitrus- 3months old.\u201d\n\nOthers, he said, are, \u201cDanjuma Rimbe -10 years old, Monday B Bitrus -19 years old, Moses Weyi \u2013 21 years old, Mbe Weyi \u2013 21 years old, Azumi Wreh, Danladi David Musa \u2013 28 years old and Garius Gado Sunday.\u201d\n\nThose injured include \u201cDanlami Adams Aged 21 years, Taji Bulus Daniel aged 30 years, Weyi Aged 42 years, Danladi James Aged 22 years, Ishya Danjuma Aged 36 years, Monday Amadu Aged 26 years.\u201d",
          "summary": "The governor, who acknowledged that peace had returned to 11 local government areas of the state, however, said Abadam and Guzamala local government areas were still under the control of Boko Haram terrorists.\n\u201cAlthough, the current Service Chiefs, the Theatre Commander, and indeed our General Officer Commanding 7 Division are up and doing.\nOn the committee delegation were Senator Abba Moro, representing Benue South, and Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Hassan Mohammed Gusau, Senator Kola Balogun from Oyo South Senatorial district, and Senator Bulus K.

          "text": "The Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) Wednesday denied what it described as \u2018fake news\u2019 in some quarters that the party had suspended process of its national convention till June 2022.\n\nThe national leadership declared that its immediate task for now was to address and resolve contestations within the party, litigations, fallouts of recently conducted congresses and generally reposition the party ahead of the national convention.\n\nThe Mai Mala Buni-led committee announced this in a statement by its national secretary, John James Akpanudoedehe in Abuja.\n\nWhile some members were asking for the national convention in February, others believed that reconciliation of all the crisis across all the chapters of the party should be considered first.\n\nBut the party said the dates for party activities such as meetings, primaries, congresses, national conventions were communicated through well-known official channels and not through \u2018sources\u2019.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe party notes and appreciates the continued support of well-meaning members and leaders as the APC Caretaker Committee undertakes the immediate task of addressing contestations within the Party, litigations, fallouts of recently-conducted Congresses and generally reposition the Party ahead of the National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe general public is advised to completely disregard fake news on the reported suspension of the planned National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) till June, as reported by some media outlets.\n\n\u201cThe faceless authors and sponsors of fake news on APC activities, in this case the planned National Convention are simply bent on causing confusion and fomenting crisis through misinformation. We should not enable them.\n\n\u201cAs a focus-driven, process-oriented political party, the APC Caretaker Committee under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni will not be distracted by self-serving antics of these sponsors of fake news.\n\n\u201cThe APC Caretaker Committee is already embarking on nationwide consultations with Party stakeholders to prepare the ground for a rancour-free National Convention. To this end, the sub-committee on budgeting and other substructures will be set up in due course.\u201d\n\nEkiti aspirants\n\nMeanwhile, two aspirants on the APC platform in the forthcoming governorship election in Ekiti state have warned the party leadership not to compromise free and fair process.\n\nThe aspirants spoke in separate interviews with journalists shortly after submitting their nomination forms at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja Wednesday.\n\nMaking his position known, one of the aspirants, Otunba Demola Popoola, said he would be comfortable with any mode the party decides to use, but warned against any form of manipulation.\n\nWhen asked about his preferred mode of primary, Popoola said: \u201cThe party has not communicated it to us which mode of primaries it will be using for the election. Whether direct or indirect, I am ready.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, I am the leading contestant in Ekiti state. You can go and confirm it. So we are not afraid of anything. All I am saying is the party should please allow free and fair elections protect our votes. They should not allow the thugs to come and hijack our votes. My people are ready to go out and vote their minds; they are not ready to sell their conscience. That is the true.\u201d\n\nOn whether he was considering stepping down for an \u2018anointed\u2019 aspirant, Popoola said: \u201cGovernor Kayode has not called me once to say Demola step down.\n\n\u201cNever! He never! All he tells me is, \u2018all I want is who will win the election for APC in Ekiti. I am not going to stop anybody.\u2019 So, the story of anointed, he has refuted. So, let us take it that way. So I am not anybody\u2019s anointed and I will not step down for anybody. Not for $200 billion.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, another governorship aspirant, Arole Oba Oluwatoyin Afolabi, said he had developed a document based on his experiences in the United States of America (USA) to move Ekiti state forward if given an opportunity.\n\nAfolabi who described himself as new in politics, said he was in the race to make a difference.\n\nHe also tasked the APC leadership to ensure emergence of a popular candidate like him, saying he enjoyed \u201cmassive support of both old and young in Ekiti state.\u201d",

The approval was given following a memo written to the President by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof Isa Ali Ibrahim,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cIn the Memo, the Minister updates and requests the President\u2019s approval for the lifting based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\u201d\n\nRELATED\n\nTop Diplomatic Missions \u2018Disappointed\u2019 With FG\u2019s Twitter Ban\n\nNigeria\u2019s Twitter Ban Provokes Outcry\n\n70 Civil Groups Ask FG To Reverse Twitter Ban, Withdraw Prosecution Threat\n\nTwitter Blocks Trump\u2019s Ardent Supporter\u2019s Account\n\n\u2018Endless Possibilities\u2019\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe government and Twitter have been in negotiations since over restoring the service based on a set of conditions, including Twitter registering operations in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, Twitter has agreed to demands for working in the country.\n\nIt added that the committee set up by the Federal Government engaged with the Twitter team to engage resolve the impasse, adding that the resolutions will bring \u201cendless possibilities\u201d.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our engagement will help Twitter improve and develop more business models to cover a broader area in Nigeria. Furthermore, the FGN looks forward to providing a conducive environment for Twitter and other global tech companies to achieve their potential and be sustainably profitable in Nigeria,\u201d the statement added.\n\nNigeria halted Twitter operations in June after the company deleted a comment by Buhari, provoking an international outcry over freedom of expression. But the presidency said the move had nothing to do with the social media platform\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cThere has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability,\u201d presidential aide, Garba Shehu, said in the wake of the suspension.\n\n\u201cMajor tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities.

          "text": "Boris Johnson is facing calls from senior Tories to resign after he admitted attending a drinks party during lockdown.\n\nThe prime minister apologised for the way he handled the event in the Downing Street garden in May 2020 and said he understood the public\u2019s \u201crage\u201d over it.\n\nCabinet members including deputy PM Dominic Raab rallied round Mr Johnson.\n\nBut Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross and MPs William Wragg, Caroline Nokes and Roger urged him to go.\n\nMr Ross, an MP and a Member of the Scottish Parliament, said he had had a \u201cdifficult conversation\u201d with Mr Johnson after he apologised on Wednesday in the House of Commons.\n\nHe said he would write to the 1922 Committee, which organises Conservative leadership contests, to register his lack of confidence in the prime minister.\n\n\u201cHe is the prime minister. It is his government that put these rules in place, and he has to be held to account for his actions,\u201d Mr Ross said.\n\nCommons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said those calling for Mr Johnson were \u201cpeople who are always unhappy\u201d and dismissed Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross as \u201cquite a lightweight figure\u201d.\n\nConservative MP Andrew Percy criticised Mr Rees-Mogg, saying: \u201cAs someone who apparently loves the Union, his personal attack on Douglas\u2026 is a gift to the petty nationalists in the SNP who want to break this country up.\u201d\n\nA minimum of 54 Conservative MPs must send letters to the committee in order to trigger a leadership challenge.\n\nThe drinks gathering, held on 20 May 2020 and described in the invitation as \u201csocially distanced\u201d, was attended by around 30 people, who were invited to bring their own alcohol. Food, including sausage rolls and crisps, was reportedly laid out on trestle tables,\n\nMr Johnson admitted at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions on Wednesday that he had joined colleagues at the event for around 25 minutes to \u201cthank groups of staff\u201d for their hard work during the pandemic, but had \u201cbelieved implicitly that this was a work event\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWith hindsight I should have sent everyone back inside. I should have found some other way to thank them, and I should have recognised that \u2013 even if it could have been said technically to fall within the guidance \u2013 there would be millions and millions of people who simply would not see it that way.\u201d\n\nMinisters have urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation by senior civil servant Sue Gray into alleged Covid-rule breaking at Downing Street parties, which is expected be published next week.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told BBC Breakfast: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let these investigations get to the full details and the full facts.\u201d\n\nHe said the prime minister recognised the \u201cfrustration, anger and upset\u201d about what people perceived to be happening at Downing Street, adding he \u201cabsolutely\u201d supported his leadership.\n\nBut Mr Wragg, a backbench MP who chairs an influential select committee, called the prime minister\u2019s position \u201cuntenable\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it should be left to the findings of a civil servant to determine the future of the prime minister and indeed who governs this country,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme.\n\nAnd fellow Tory Caroline Nokes, who chairs another Commons committee, said the prime minister should resign now as he was \u201cdamaging the entire Conservative brand\u201d.\n\nThe former minister, who has previously been critical of Mr Johnson\u2019s leadership, told ITV\u2019s Robert Peston: \u201cRegretfully, he looks like a liability. And I think he either goes now, or he goes in three years\u2019 time at a general election.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s admission and apology in the Commons likely bought him a little time.\n\nA pause until the official inquiry into what parties did or didn\u2019t take place in Downing Street is published, in perhaps a week or so.\n\nBut for many on his own side, Boris Johnson has already lost the benefit of the doubt.\n\nGrowing numbers of his own MPs want him out, discussing frantically how and when his exit could take place.\n\nAt Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson\u2019s explanation for his attendance at the drinks gathering was \u201cso ridiculous that it\u2019s actually offensive to the British public\u201d and he called on Mr Johnson \u201cto do the decent thing and resign\u201d.\n\nThe SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, called on Tory MPs to force the prime minister out.\n\nAnd Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who has asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate Mr Johnson\u2019s attendance at the drinks, said he had to go.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s statement was met with a mixed reaction from Conservative MPs, with Dan Poulter saying it was \u201cnot much consolation\u201d for those who had worked on the frontline in the NHS.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss and Chancellor Rishi Sunak \u2013 both tipped as potential successors to Mr Johnson as leader \u2013 tweeted their support on Wednesday evening.\n\nMs Truss said she stood behind the prime minister \u201c100%\u201d, while Mr Sunak said Mr Johnson had been \u201cright to apologise\u201d, adding that he supported the PM\u2019s call for \u201cpatience\u201d while Ms Gray completed her investigation.\n\nA poll for The Times by YouGov, carried out before Mr Johnson\u2019s apology at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, gave Labour at a 10-point lead over the Conservatives \u2013 the party\u2019s biggest lead since December 2013.\n\nThe government is facing mounting pressure over several events that are alleged to have been held during lockdowns in 2020. Here is what we know about them and the restrictions in place at the time:\n\n10 May 2020\n\nBoris Johnson announced a plan to take the \u201cfirst careful steps\u201d out of the lockdown that began in March 2020. But he said people should continue to \u201cobey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them\u201d.\n\nLegal restrictions at the time said you could not leave your house without a reasonable excuse and government guidance was that you could meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor setting while exercising.\n\n15 May 2020\n\nA photo from May 2020 showed the prime minister and his staff with bottles of wine and a cheeseboard in the Downing Street garden. When asked about it, Boris Johnson said, \u201cthose people were at work talking about work\u201d.\n\n20 May 2020\n\nAbout 100 people were invited by email to \u201csocially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden\u201d on behalf of the prime minister\u2019s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.\n\nWitnesses told the BBC the PM and his wife were among about 30 people who attended.\n\nBoris Johnson has confirmed he attended the event, saying he was there for 25 minutes and \u201cbelieved implicitly that this was a work event\u201d.\n\n17 July 2020\n\nBoris Johnson announced plans for a \u201csignificant return to normality\u201d in England by Christmas \u201cthrough targeted, local action\u201d instead of national lockdowns.\n\nBut he added that the timetable relied on \u201cevery one of us staying alert and acting responsibly\u201d.\n\n5 November 2020\n\nWith cases of coronavirus rising again, the prime minister told people in England that \u201cwe are once again asking you to stay at home\u201d as a new national lockdown began.\n\nHe said people should only leave their homes \u201cfor work if you can\u2019t work from home, for education, and for essential activities and emergencies\u201d. Indoor gatherings with other households were banned, unless they were for work purposes.\n\n13 November 2020\n\nSources told the BBC that Downing Street staff members attended a gathering with Carrie Johnson in the flat where she and the prime minister live. A spokesman for Mrs Johnson denies the party took place.\n\n27 November 2020\n\nA leaving event was held for No 10 aide, Cleo Watson, where people were drinking, and Mr Johnson made a speech, according to sources.\n\n2 December 2020\n\nThe second national lockdown ended after four weeks but Boris Johnson replaced those restrictions with \u201ctough tiers to keep this virus down\u201d.\n\nLondon was placed in tier two, which banned two or more people from different households from meeting indoors, unless \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for work purposes.\n\n10 December 2020\n\nThe Department for Education has confirmed it had an office gathering to thank staff for their work during the pandemic. It says drinks and snacks were brought by those who attended and no outside guests or support staff were invited.\n\n14 December 2020\n\nThe Conservative Party has admitted that an \u201cunauthorised gathering\u201d took place at its HQ in Westminster. It was held by the team of the party\u2019s London-mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, who has since stepped down as chair of the London Assembly police and crime committee. The Metropolitan Police is to speak to two people who attended the party.\n\n15 December 2020\n\nMultiple sources have told the BBC there was a Christmas quiz for No 10 staff last year. A photo \u2013 published by the Sunday Mirror \u2013 showed Boris Johnson taking part and sitting between two colleagues in No 10. Mr Johnson has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n16 December 2020\n\nLondon moved into the highest tier of restrictions and Matt Hancock, who was health secretary at the time, said it was important \u201ceveryone is cautious\u201d ahead of the festive period.\n\nThe Department for Transport apologised after confirming reports of a party in its offices that day, calling it \u201cinappropriate\u201d and an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d by staff.\n\n18 December 2020\n\nDowning Street originally denied a report by the Daily Mirror that a party took place in Downing Street.\n\nHowever, a video obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister\u2019s then-press secretary Allegra Stratton, joking about reports of an event, saying: \u201cThis fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.\u201d\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Novak Djokovic remained in limbo even after he was included in the draw for the Australian Open on Thursday, with the tennis star still awaiting a government decision on whether to deport him for not being vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nDespite the cloud hanging over Djokovic\u2019s ability to compete, Australian Open organizers included the top seed in the draw. He is slated to play fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, who is ranked world No. 78., in the opening round next week.\n\nNo. 1-ranked Djokovic had his visa canceled on arrival in Melbourne last week when his vaccination exemption was rejected, but he won a legal battle on procedural grounds that allowed him to stay in the country.\n\nImmigration Minister Alex Hawke has been considering the question since a judge reinstated Djokovic\u2019s visa on Monday.\n\nExpectations of a pending decision were raised when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called an afternoon news conference after a national Cabinet meeting. Speculation heightened when the tournament draw was postponed by 75 minutes to a time after Morrison\u2019s news conference.\n\nThe wait continued after both events concluded, with Morrison referring questions on Djokovic to his immigration minister.\n\n\u201cThese are personal ministerial powers able to be exercised by Minister Hawke and I don\u2019t propose to make any further comment at this time,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nAustralian Open tournament director Craig Tiley also declined comment after the draw ceremony for the tournament that starts Monday.\n\nThe 34-year-old Djokovic has been trying to focus his attention on the playing court in the four days since he was released from immigration detention. He held a practice session at Rod Laver Arena, his fourth this week, in the mid-afternoon.\n\nHe was on the practice court Wednesday when a statement posted on his social media accounts acknowledged that his Australian travel declaration form contained incorrect information.\n\nIn the statement, Djokovic blamed \u201chuman error\u201d by his support team for failing to declare that he had traveled in the two-week period before entering Australia.\n\nGiving false information on the form could be grounds for deportation. That could result in sanctions ranging up to a three-year ban from entering Australia, a daunting prospect for a player who has won almost half of his 20 Grand Slam singles titles here.\n\nDjokovic acknowledged the lapses when he sought to clarify what he called \u201ccontinuing misinformation\u201d about his movements after he became infected last month. It also raised questions about his public appearances in Serbia last month, particularly a media interview he attended despite knowing he was positive.\n\nIt was another twist in a saga over whether the athlete should be allowed stay in Australia despite not being vaccinated.\n\nThe initial news that Djokovic was granted an exemption to strict vaccination rules to enter the country provoked an outcry and the ensuing dispute has since overshadowed the lead-up to the Australian Open.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said most Australians disapproved of the nine-time and defending Australian Open champion coming to Melbourne to compete in breach of the nation\u2019s tough pandemic quarantine rules.\n\n\u201cMost of us thought because Mr. Djokovic hadn\u2019t been vaxxed twice that he would be asked to leave,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cWell, that was our view, but it wasn\u2019t the court\u2019s view.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Australians \u2026 didn\u2019t like the idea that another individual, whether they\u2019re a tennis player or \u2026 the king of Spain or the Queen of England, can come up here and have a different set of rules to what everybody else has to deal with,\u201d Joyce added.\n\nThe debate over Djokovic\u2019s presence in Australia rages against a backdrop of surging COVID-19 infections across the nation.\n\nVictoria state, which hosts the Australian Open, on Thursday eased seven-day isolation rules for close contacts of those infected in sectors including education and transport to curb the number of employees staying away from work.\n\nThe state recorded 37,169 new cases in the latest 24-hour period on Thursday, as well as 25 deaths and 953 hospitalizations. With cases surging, the Victoria state government moved to limit ticket sales to the tennis tournament in a bid to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nDjokovic\u2019s visa status has been debated since he arrived more than a week ago, after posting on social media that he had received exemption permission.\n\nAt issue is whether he has a valid exemption to strict rules requiring vaccination to enter Australia since he recently recovered from COVID-19.\n\nHis exemption to compete was approved by the Victoria state government and Tennis Australia, the tournament organizer. That apparently allowed him to receive a visa to travel.\n\nBut the Australian Border Force rejected the exemption and canceled his visa upon arrival before a federal judge overturned that decision. Lawyers for the government have said an infection was only grounds for an exemption in cases in which the coronavirus caused severe illness \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear why he was issued a visa if that\u2019s the case.\n\nIf Djokovic\u2019s visa is canceled, his lawyers could go back to court to apply for an injunction that would prevent him from being forced to leave the country.",

          "text": "Mali and Tunisia\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations game finished in chaos after the referee first signalled for full-time on 85 minutes, then ended the match when the clock showed 89 minutes and 47 seconds.\n\nTunisia coach Mondher Kebaier and his technical staff raced on to the field to confront referee Janny Sikazwe after his final whistle consigned them to a 1-0 defeat in Group F.\n\nTwenty minutes later, after Mali manager Mohamed Magassouba\u2019s post-match press conference had started, tournament organisers ordered the game to be played to a conclusion.\n\nHowever, in more farcical scenes, Tunisia\u2019s players did not return to the field and Mali were declared winners.\n\nKebaier called the referee\u2019s actions \u201cinexplicable\u201d, adding: \u201cHe blew for full time and asked us to go to the dressing room, so the players were in their ice baths and then he asked us to come back out.\n\n\u201cIn 30 years in this business, I have never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nAt the end of an action-packed second half, which saw two stoppages for video assistant referee checks as well as a drinks break and several substitutions, Sikazwe became the centre of attention.\n\nThe Zambian \u2013 who refereed two group-stage games at the 2018 World Cup in Russia \u2013 had signalled for full-time with five minutes remaining, before checking his timings and continuing the game.\n\nThen he ended the match 23 seconds before the 90th minute mark \u2013 and without adding on any additional time for stoppages.\n\nKebaier and his staff angrily confronted Sikazwe and his assistants on the pitch, pointing to their watches and remonstrating about the lack of added time.\n\nThe officials were given an escort off the pitch by stadium security as the Malians celebrated in front of their fans, but the controversy did not end there.\n\nMore than 20 minutes later, the Malian side ventured back on to the field for the game to restart, with fourth official Helder Martins Rodrigues de Carvalho set to take charge instead of Sikazwe.\n\nAfter a short time on the pitch he was told to bring the players off again by officials as the North Africans had failed to emerge, and Mali were awarded the victory.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult situation to deal with. The referee also blew with five minutes left in the first half and then he blew after 89 minutes, denying us practically seven or eight minutes of added time,\u201d added Kebaier, whose team had an extra man at the end after Mali\u2019s El Bilal Toure was sent off.\n\n\u201cHis decision is inexplicable. I can\u2019t understand how he made his decision and we will see what happens now.\u201d\n\nThe Confederation of African Football (Caf), organisers of the tournament, will have questions to answer following a farcical ending and Tunisian protests.\n\n\u201cWe were told to go back on the pitch because the game was not finished,\u201d said Magassouba, who was giving his post-match news conference when an official entered the room to announce the game would restart with three minutes left to play.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the opposition team did not want to come back out and the final whistle was blown.\u201d\n\nOn the field, Ibrahima Kone\u2019s 48th-minute penalty \u2013 awarded after a shot struck the back of the arm of Ellyes Skhiri \u2013 proved to be the winner.\n\nBut Mali keeper Ibrahim Mounkoro saved a 77th-minute spot-kick from Wahbi Khazri, diving to his right to push away a well-struck effort from the Carthage Eagles captain.\n\nSikazwe had taken time at the VAR monitor to award the foul after Khazri\u2019s cross flicked the hand of Moussa Djenepo, with more than two minutes elapsing between the incident and the ball being placed on the spot.\n\nMali substitute Toure was shown a straight red card late on for catching the ankle of Tunisia defender Dylan Bronn, another incident which required a check on the video screen.\n\nThe West Africans are considered outside contenders for the Nations Cup after an unbeaten World Cup qualifying campaign so far, but the nature of the officiating will provide more of a talking point than their display in Limbe.\n\nThe city in south-west Cameroon has seen an increased security presence because of recent conflict stoked by local militants pursuing a separatist agenda.",
