          "title": "Why men suffer erectile dysfunction, low sex drive as they age \u2013Experts",
          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nMedical experts say the inability of men to have a satisfying sex life as they age is often due to low testosterone, damage to the blood vessels and nerves in the male organs.\n\nThe experts noted that these challenges usually lead to a lack of sex drive and erectile dysfunction.\n\nAccording to them, diabetes, hypertension, obesity can also negatively affect males\u2019 sexual performance.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a Consultant Urologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Dr. Oluwaseun Akinola said erectile dysfunction is common among men from age 50 but is hardly discussed because of stigmatisation.\n\nErectile dysfunction is the inability to attain or maintain penile erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse.\n\nExplaining, he said, \u201cThere are three things that could affect a male\u2019s sexual performance and they have equal importance. Number one is the hormone. The hormone of the male is testosterone that is responsible for the desire to have sex and maintain an erection.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we have the blood vessels in the male genital organ, with arteries and veins and you have the nerves which carry the signals and all these things need to be working perfectly for a man to have a good erection. But, if anything affects them, it can affect the sexual performance of a man.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have a combination of diabetes, high blood sugar, they can affect the function of the nerves in the genital organ and it could lead to erectile problems. If you have problems with the blood vessels, it can lead to problems with sexual performance.\u201dThe Urologist also noted that obesity can affect sexual performance by damaging the blood vessels and decreasing testosterone.\n\n\u201cObesity is related to poor management of sugar in the body, something we refer to as metabolic syndrome and can lead to diabetes which can affect the nerves.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is for a man to see what can improve the functions of the hormones, nerves, veins and help reduce obesity. Things that will make you healthier are generally good for sexual health. So, weight loss, exercise, eating the right food can help. Exercise reduces obesity which can affect hormones as well.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in men that are fat is that testosterone produced by the body can be converted by the fat cells into estrogen and it can affect erectile function, even the desire to have sex.\n\n\u201cWhen a man presents with this problem, you have to find out what is causing the problem. Sometimes, you can reverse it and if addressed early enough,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, Dr. Akinola said age is a risk factor for erectile dysfunction among men; \u201cas the age increases, erectile dysfunction increases and several studies have confirmed this.\u201d\n\nA study published in the Turkish Journal of Urology shows that the severity of erectile dysfunction is directly related to vascular risk factors, such as high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, smoking, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe study noted that the median prevalence of erectile dysfunction was calculated as 33 percent among all males greater than or equal to 40 years of age.\n\nWhen subjects were stratified by age; median prevalence rates of erectile dysfunction were 17 percent for 40\u201349 years, 35.5 percent for 50\u201359 years, 68.8 percent for 60\u201369 years, and 82.9 percent for males greater than or equal to 70 years.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a greater understanding of the epidemiological surveys of the prevalence of ED and its associations will help clinicians to look outside our specialty for strategies to improve male sexual function in order to improve their quality of life.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to take a more global approach to the management of ED, one that focuses not only on chronic diseases but also men\u2019s sexual quality of life,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nDr. Akinola added that 50 per cent of men aged 50 experience some degrees of erectile problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a common thing but to prevent it, you have to target what we refer to as modifiable risk factors. These are things that target your arteries, veins, and nerves. The important takeaway message for men trying to improve their sexual performance is the importance of being in good health and exercising,\u201d Akinola said.\n\nAccording to him, some common medications can also have negative effects on male libido and erection.\n\nHe said the sexual performance of a man may be decreased by drugs that block the testosterone.\n\n\u201cAny medication that will alter the hormones in the body can affect sexual function. Any medication that lowers testosterone can do that. Some other medications that can cause erectile dysfunction are common blood pressure medications such as beta-blockers.\n\n\u201cIt is advisable to discuss with your doctor if you notice a decline in your erectile function after starting a new medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government before ECOWAS Court over \u201csecrecy in the spending of loans so far obtained, the unsustainable level of borrowing by the government and the 36 states, the crippling debt burden.\n\nIn the suit, filed before the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja, last week by SERAP lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, the organisation is seeking an order directing and compelling the Federal Government to issue an immediate moratorium on borrowing by itself and the 36 states, in conformity with the country\u2019s international human rights obligations.\n\nSERAP is also seeking an order directing and compelling the Federal Government to publish details of spending of the loans obtained by governments since 1999, including the list of projects and locations of any such projects on which these loans have been spent.\n\nIn the suit filed by SERAP and on behalf of concerned Nigerians, the organisation maintained that \u201cPersistent and unsustainable borrowing by the federal and state governments and the crippling debt burden undermine the rights of Nigerians to economic and social development, and are antithetical to the public interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP: \u201cThere is lack of transparency and accountability in the spending of the loans so far obtained, and opacity around the terms and conditions in loan agreements, including repayment details for these loans. The details of the projects on which the loans are spent are shrouded in secrecy.\n\n\u201cIf not addressed, the escalating borrowing and looming debt crisis would cripple the ability of both the Federal Government and the 36 states to deliver, ensure basic socio-economic rights, such as quality healthcare, education, and clean water of the most vulnerable and marginalized sectors of the population.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and many of the 36 states would seem to be in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress.\u201d\n\nSERAP, quoting reports, stated: \u201cThe Senate and House of Representatives recently approved the loans of $5,803,364,553.50 and a grant component of $10 million under the 2018-2020 External Borrowing (Rolling) Plan of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis followed previous approvals by the National Assembly of $16.2 (16,230,077,718) billion loan; \u20ac1 (1,020,000,000) million and a grant component of $125 million loan; $36.8 billion, \u20ac910 million loans, and a grant component of $10 million; $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans; $6.1 billion, $1.5 billion and 995 million loans; and $4(4,054,476,863), \u20ac710 million and grant component of $125 million.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

I deliberately waited to be part of the service because we need to thank God for the kind of life our father lived and all that he left behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt over 95 years of age, what else does anyone expect? Also, for all the developments we have witnessed through Baba\u2019s efforts in Oyo State and Ogbomosoland as well as this country at large, are we not supposed to thank God for all that?\n\n\u201cWhen I was campaigning, I went to the palace in Ogbomoso, and baba looked at me and said \u2018Seyi, you look calm and gentle now because you are looking for votes to become the governor. By the time your aspiration is fulfilled, you would start doing something different from what you have promised.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I replied saying I would do exactly what the people want but that he should support me to get to the office first.\n\n\u201cWhen we went inside, Baba asked me for just one thing, and he never requested for any other for himself. He prophesied that God will make me get to that position and that when I get there, I should do just one thing for him and for Ogbomosoland \u2013 secure the sole ownership of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, LAUTECH.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promised him that when I get into the office, by the grace of God, within 18 months of being in that office, the request will be achieved. And I am happy that during Baba\u2019s lifetime, we were able to achieve it.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Vice-President of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, stated that Soun\u2019s reign was 48 years of progress for Ogbomosoland.\n\nOsinbajo, who on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, expressed heartfelt condolences to the people of Ogbomoso and the government of Oyo State, said: \u201cThe late Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, had an exceptionally long, peaceful, and progressive reign, for which we must just continue to give thanks to God Almighty.\u201d\n\nIn his sermon, the presiding Pastor of the First Baptist Church, Oke\u2019lerin, Revd.

          "text": "By Adeola Badru \u2013 Ibadan\n\nSome members of the National Assembly have disclosed that they have not stopped work on the process of amending the 1999 Constitution, assuring Nigerians that the amended document would be ready before the end of the Ninth National Assembly.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Ibadan, on Sunday, at a town hall meeting with their constituents, the lawmakers, Senator Olubunmi Adetumbi from Ekiti North, Senator Tolu Odebiyi from Ogun West, Senator Kola Balogun from Oyo South, Mr. Bamidele Salam, who represented Ede North/Ede South/Egbedore /Ejigbo Federal Constituency of Osun State; Isiaka Ibrahim, who represented Ifo/Ewekoro Federal Constituency of Ogun State, and Babajide Obanikoro, who represents Eti-Osa Federal Constituency of Lagos State, said there is no going back on the amendment of the constitution.\n\nSalami said: \u201cThe constitution will be amended before the end of this Ninth National Assembly. I want to assure you that the amendment will be done. But let me tell you that amending a document such as a constitution of a country is a very serious business. It is an assignment that requires wide-ranging engagements of critical stakeholders, opinion moulders, and institutions.\n\n\u201cEven though we may not have cameras being beamed on what is being done presently, that does not mean that nothing is being done. People sent in memoranda from everywhere and there were submissions made by members of the National Assembly themselves to amend certain aspects of the constitution.\n\n\u201cAll these will be aggregated into a sizable portion so that we don\u2019t have an unwieldy set of clauses being pushed forward for amendment. Very soon, we will start seeing more activities in that regard. Before the end of this year, we would have been able to see some things.\n\n\u201cSome of those provisions will be sent to the houses of assembly very soon, especially the ones that we have formed consensus on, they will be passed and sent and others will follow suit in the last part of this Ninth National Assembly.\u201d\n\nGiving an insight into the aspects Nigerians want to be amended, he said the South-West wanted devolution of powers and true federalism more than anything; and the creation of more states was more dominant from the South-East. He added that the issue of moving derivation funds from 13 per cent to 50 per cent is very important to the people of the South-South.\n\nThe lawmaker also said the policing system would be touched by the amendment, saying it was out of place for the police to draw resources from the states and local government while those who they benefit from have no say in their operations.\n\n\u201cIt is my desire and that of my people that we should unbundle the policing system in Nigeria. It is actually in our own interest and I get baffled at times when I see those who are afraid of that. I don\u2019t know what anybody is afraid of in unbundling the Police to have a decentralised control system, a more decentralised funding system.\n\n\u201cI was a local government chairman and we were buying tyres and batteries for police vehicles and paying them allowance even though we did not have control over them. As a member of the National Assembly today, the police in my constituency still write letters to me to come and repair their vehicles.\n\n\u201cIf we have a system that wants to derive resources from local and state governments, and they have no say in the recruitments and their operations, how does that work?\u201d\n\nI am very hopeful that the amended constitution will take good care of this area,\u201d he added.\n\nA member of the House of Representatives from Ifo/ Ewekoro Federal Constituency of Ogun State, Isiaka Ibrahim, said Nigerians would see the progress made so far by the lawmakers concerning the amendment of the constitution as from January 27.\n\nIbrahim said: \u201cBased on the work plan that has just been rolled out, the constitution will be passed on to the President for his assent. The amended constitution would be transmitted to the President before the end of February.\u201d\n\nThe town hall meeting was organised by Daria Media and supported by MacArthur Foundation\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It is surprising to hear such a statement from the chief security officer of the state.\n\n\u201cThough he later denied the statement, saying that he was misquoted, he has forgotten that his statement was recorded by the journalists. Then, who is fooling who? Is it the fool that is fooling the fools?\u201d he queried.\n\nSpeaking further, the analysts noted, \u201cBut the common masses are ignorant of the political antics being played by these so-called greedy politicians who are the public enemies but luckily found themselves in the corridors of power.\u201d\n\nAhmad stated that a responsible government can not fold its hands and watch people being killed by bandits on a daily basis, saying that all the government top officials have well-equipped security personnel both in their houses and offices but left the common masses helpless.\n\n\u201cThey are treating the security of lives and property of common masses with a mere wave of hand because they have provided adequate security for themselves.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle does not even want newsmen in his state to report the everyday killings in Zamfara. But if the journalists do not report what is actually happening in the state, how would the state get national and international assistance?\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the analyst, every politician in Nigeria is now warming up for 2023 general elections to come back and devour the remnant they have left, stressing that when the time comes, they will be giving out their looted money for the poor masses who are terribly hungry to come out en mass and vote for them again.\n\n\u201cThe truth remains that these politicians do not want to end poverty in the country because if they battle poverty, they would not see the youths to be used as political thugs again,\u201d Ahmad observed.\n\nAccording to him, these politicians would always like to recover the money they spent during the campaign period before thinking of doing anything for the poor masses that brought them to power.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nNigerians seem to be at crossroads over the move by the Federal Government to suspend payment of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in August 2021 signed the Petroleum Industry Bill into law, signaling an end to petrol subsidy.\n\nBut in what looks like a dramatic twist, the Senate President, Mr. Ahmed Lawan, had last week during a meeting with Buhari, said the President has not authorised the removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nNigerians and stakeholders alike were still dissecting the comments of Lawan when they were confronted with another position of the National Executive Council (NEC) which suggests that the Federal Government may not be in a position to continue with petrol subsidy.\n\nIf the recommendation of the ad-hoc committee of NEC was implemented by the Federal Government, it might increase the price of petrol to N302 per litre in February.\n\nThis position, however contradicts the stance of the Federal Government as put forward by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, that funding of petrol subsidy will continue till June because it has made provisions for it in the budget.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State said the Federal Government was spending about N2 trillion on petroleum subsidy annually.\n\nThe governor said the amount could have been used for other purposes, adding that petrol, which sells for N162-165 per litre in Nigeria, is 100 per cent higher in other countries.\n\nAccording to him, the NEC wondered whether that should be allowed to continue in a situation where, he pointed out, only two-thirds of the states of the federation consume the subsidy.\n\nNasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, said: \u201cAs you are aware, the issue of subsidy has been one matter that NEC has deliberated on for more than a year now.\n\n\u201cThere was an ad-hoc committee, which was set up by NEC headed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State that included members of the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cThe committee worked on recommendations as to what we should do about the cost of PMS locally because as you realise, as has been told us, the cost of PMS in Nigeria today is about N162 per litre, whereas every other country surrounding Nigeria is selling the same product at more than 100 per cent of the cost in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd the country as at last year spent in excess of N2 trillion subsidising petroleum products. That is money that could have gone into building roads, money that could have gone into healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cSo, for NEC, the arguments have been put out: should we continue this regime of spending money we do not have to subsidise the living standards of only mostly those who have vehicles?\n\n\u201cAnd when NEC looked at some of the analysis last year, we then realised that less than 1/3 of the states of this country consume two-thirds of the subsidy.\n\nOn his part, former Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar, has warned against removing fuel subsidy, saying the decision will push more Nigerians into poverty.\n\nAbubakar stated this at the 19th Daily Trust Dialogue in Abuja, last week.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe recommendations were put forward by the NEC ad-hoc committee interfacing with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) on the appropriate pricing of petrol in Nigeria.\n\nCommenting on the development, Abubakar said: \u201cThe expected fuel price increment will push more Nigerians into poverty.\n\nOver 80 million Nigerians are still cut off by poverty. Nigeria faces a food crisis worsened by the global COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Labour Congress(NLC), which has consistently warned against subsidy removal, also last week reiterated its earlier position against the move.\n\nNLC Chairman in Ebonyi State, Mr. Ikechikwu Nwafor, warned that the planned removal of fuel subsidy and subsequent increase in fuel price would affect every facet of life, including transportation, cost of food items, clothing, housing and others.\n\nNwafor stated that it was high time Nigeria fixed its own refineries, adding that Nigeria can end the importation of fuel in the country if it can have the refineries working.\n\n\u201cWe should understand that this is not the right time to increase the pump price when the cost of living is already difficult. Prices of food commodities are already beyond the capacity of civil servants.\n\n\u201cHow will the civil servants, who are the engine of the economy, cope?\n\n\u201cWhat we are telling the Federal Government is to consider the consequences of the increase on the masses and the current economy,\u201d Nwafor said.\n\nHe warned that the increase is going to affect every facet of life, including transportation, high cost of food items, clothing, housing, among others.\n\nHe also stated that the NLC Chapter in Ebonyi State plans to embark on a protest on January 27, urging all Nigerians and Ebonyi state to rise against the removal of oil subsidy and hike on fuel price.\n\n\u201cOf course, the increase is going to affect all citizens and we are saying no to it,\u201d he said.\n\nMeawhile, the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) recently presented three prerequisites that will ensure a rancour-free removal of the fuel subsidy and prevent economic disruption and industrial disharmony in the country. The OPSN comprises Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN); Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA); Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA); Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industries(NASSI) and Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME).\n\nProffering ways to ensure a rancor-free subsidy removal, its Chairman, Taiwo Adeniyi, said: \u201cThe controversy being generated by fuel subsidy is getting to a crescendo and it will be important to guide government and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWhile there are proponents and opponents of the fuel subsidy regime, three things are indisputable: the fuel-subsidy regime seems fraught with corruption, with few petroleum importers benefiting. The subsidy payment is a huge leakage from the revenue portfolio of the nation and there is a need to address it urgently to free up needed funds for development. The resuscitation of the four refineries that millions of dollars had been invested in their Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) or outright sale of the refineries to private investors to enhance their sustainability.\n\n\u201cSpecific relieves to address the anticipated drastic reduction in the citizen\u2019s disposable income and standard of living. It is expected that an increase in fuel price will have a direct and immediate consequence on transportation and costs of foodstuff, amongst others.\n\nThe touted N5,000 monthly stipend to 40 million poorest of the poor will most likely aggravate tempers. A more sustainable, well-thought-out relief should be proposed.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nAs Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in the banking sector ballooned to N1.3 trillion as of last November, lenders are raising the red flag that the humongous debts are crippling their operations , putting them under the risk of regulatory forbearance or systemic failure as recovery efforts are hampered by inefficiencies of the system.\n\nLamenting this scenario recently, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Deputy Governor in charge of Financial System Stability, Mrs. Aisha Ahmad, decried some bank customers penchant for defaulting on their loans, blaming the trend for poor credit growth in the country\n\n\u201cNow we are not unaware of some of the challenges or reasons why credit have not been growing. Part of that is the appetite of banks to lend especially when you have customers that wilfully refuse to repay their loans\u201d She said.\n\nAlso voicing his concern for this ugly development, Managing Director of Bank of Industry (BoI), Mr Olukayode Pitan, recently blamed some local entrepreneurs\u2019 habit of not wanting to repay loans taken form lenders, stressing that his bank\u2019s non-performing loan portfolio awarded to entrepreneurs ranges between 80 and 100 per cent.\n\nFor his part, Special Adviser to Ekiti State Governor on Micro-credit and Enterprise Development Agency, Kayode Fasawe, stated recently that \u201cthe attitude of the people on loan repayment has deprived the state the opportunity of accessing further funds from CBN. This has been counterproductive to the economic development of the state.\u201d\n\nOn the Ekiti state issue, the Director of Small and Medium Enterprise in the Ministry of Investment, Mr Ayo Ilesanmi, speaking in the same vein, said it was quite disheartening that loans beneficiaries in the state considered the money as free gift or their own share of the national cake.\n\nAnd out of N1.23 trillion NPLs recorded by banks at the end of 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recently disclosed that the NPLs in the power sector stood at N33.22 billion. The CBN had also reported that the combined indebtedness of power firms to the banking sector stands at about N820 billion. While the unpaid UBA loans had led to the take-over of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) last Thursday also took over Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) Limited over its inability to clear its acquisition loan from Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, analysis of the results of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI) Nigeria Plc, Wema Bank Plc, FBN Holdings, Sterling Bank Plc and FCMB released to the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) showed that, while some of the lenders have reduced their NPLs, others only recorded marginal increase. For instance, Union Bank recorded marginal increase in its NPLs ratio during the period, while Wema recorded significant drop in its NPL ratio.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHowever, ETI Nigeria and FBN Holdings are the only two banks with NPL ratios above the regulatory threshold in first half (H1) of 2021.\n\nAs reported in the first six months of the year\u2019s unaudited results, Ecobank Nigeria\u2019s NPLs dropped to 17per cent from 19.9 per cent recorded in H1 2020, while FBN Holdings reported 7.2 per cent NPL/Gross Loans from 8.80 per cent recorded in H1 2020. FBN Holdings\u2019 Group Managing Director, Urum Kalu Eke, had, while commenting on the bank\u2019s H1 results, said the macro and socio-economic conditions remain challenging, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the low-interest rates environment.\n\nHe added that the bank remains committed to its strategic objective of driving further stability in performance, as well as delivering sustainable growth over the years to come.\n\nWema\u2019s NPLs closed H1 2021 at 3.5 per cent from 5.6 per cent in H1 2020 just as Sterling Bank\u2019s NPLs declined from 1.9 per cent in H1 2020 to 1.79 per cent in H1 2021.\n\nIn addition, FCMB Group\u2019S NPLs declined from 3.5 per cent in H1 2020 to 3.3 per cent in H1 2021, while Union Bank of Nigeria\u2019s NPL ratio increased to 4.30 per cent in H1 2021 from 4.00 per cent recorded in H1 2020.\n\nFurther analysis showed a 13.4 per cent increase in FCMB Group NPLs to N3.78 billion in H1 2021 from N2.55 billion, dragging the financial institution NPLs by value to N32.21 billion in H1 2021 from N29.77 billion recorded in H1 2020.\n\nAnalysts attributed banks decline in some bank\u2019s NPLs to ease of COVID-19 lockdown, effective management of credit risk and reduction of risk to some sectors. FBN Holdings in its H1 2021 reported 20 per cent drop in Impairment charge for losses to N24.5 billion in H1 2021 from N30.7 billion reported in H1 2020, while FCMB Group Impairment losses on financial instruments dropped by 48 per cent to N4 billion in H1 2021 from N7.74 billion reported in H1 2020.",

          "text": "*Dangote Cement, BUA Foods buoy performance\n\n*Increased liquidity responsible for massive gains, experts say\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nGlobal equities suffered their biggest decline in more than a year last week, as heavy losses in Netflix shares accentuated a sell-off in tech stocks that spilled into other sectors. But in Nigeria, it was the opposite, as the market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) appreciated remarkably by 11.05 per cent or N2.46 trillion in the first three weeks of trading in 2022.\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation of the NGX opened in 2022 at N22.297 trillion, and closed last Friday at N24.761 trillion, while the NGX All-Share Index (NGX ASI) grew by 7.6 per cent or 3,240.91 basis points to 45,957.35 basis points, from the 42,716.44 basis points it opened this year.\n\nThe NGX ASI last week reached highest level since January 19, 2018, when it hit 45,092.83 basis points.\n\nThe stock market in the first trading week kicked off on a strong note, gaining N1.33 trillion in market capitalisation. In the second trading week, market capitalisation gained N323 billion week-on-week to close at N23.951 trillion from the N23.628 trillion it had opened for trading.\n\nMarket analysts attributed the strong rally in the market to improvement in the economy, boost in liquidity, as well as investors\u2019 renewed interest in the stock market.\n\nNotably, price appreciation in BUA Foods, BUA Cement Plc, Seplat Energy Plc, Airtel Africa Plc, Dangote Cement Plc, among others, sustained gains recorded in the first three weeks of trading on the NGX, as investors took position on companies with strong fundamentals in anticipation of the release of their 2021 audited financial results and dividend pay-out.\n\nBUA Foods was the most appreciated stock on the Exchange, gaining 61 per cent to close at N64.4 per share, from N40 per share it was when it was listed this year. This was followed by Airtel Africa that has so far gained 21 per cent to close at N1, 155.50 per share, higher that the N955 per share it opened for trading.\n\nSimilarly, the stock price of Dangote Cement added nearly 11 per cent to close last week at N284.9 per share, up from the N257 per share it opened in 2022, while Lafarge Africa Plc rose by 6.1 per cent to close at N25.4 per share, up from N23.9 per share.\n\nSeplat was one of leading stocks on the Exchange, gaining 16.2 per cent to N755.1 last week, from N650 per share it opened for trading, just as BUA Cement gained 6.5 per cent to close at N71.4 per share, from N67.05 the market opened this year.\n\nIn the same vein, Zenith Bank\u2019s stock rose by 2.59 per cent to N25.80, up from N25.15, and FBN Holdings gained 5.3 per cent to N12, from N11.40, both lifting the NGX banking index by 3.22 per cent to close last week at 419.14 basis points.\n\nThe NGX Oil & Gas and Industrial Good indices led others, gaining 9.90 per cent and 8.45 per cent, respectively, in year-to-date (YTD) performance, as Consumer Good recorded a decline of 4.21 per cent YTD growth.\n\nIt was investors bargain hunting in BUA Foods, Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, and International Breweries, which drove the weekly gains.\n\nIn early January 2022, BUA Foods was approved by the management of the NGX to list on the Main Board a total of 18 billion units at N40.00 per share and Dangote Cement announced the commencement of the second tranche of its share buyback programme. The cement manufacturing company said it would be repurchasing 170 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each, representing one per cent of the company\u2019s issued shares.\n\nAccording to the company, this includes 40.2 million shares held as treasury shares, following the conclusion of Tranche I of the share buyback programme. It said the transaction would take place at the open market on the NGX, subject to prevailing market conditions and under the current daily trading rules of the Bourse.\n\nHowever, Vice President, Highcap Securities, Mr. David Adnori, noted that increase in macroeconomic activities as well as liquidity following a successful bid in bond market in December boosted the stock market lately.\n\nAccording to Adnori, \u201cTowards the end of 2021, a lot of investors subscribed to the debt market and it was oversubscribed. Some of those funds are now being invested in the stock market, a major reason we are witnessing appreciation in market performance.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have seen activities that have attracted investors into the stock market. The BUA Foods listing, the transactions by Airtel in East Africa, and Dangote Cement share buyback have impacted on the market in the last three weeks.\n\n\u201cOverall, the market is driven by information regarding anticipation towards 2021 full year results and accounts. Investors are investing in stocks with good fundamentals and dividend paying stock on NGX.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer, APT securities & Funds Limited, Mallam Garba Kurfi, attributed the growth to various activities by listed companies on the NGX.\n\nKurfi said, \u201cWe have seen the issue of Dangote Cement share buyback, the BUA Foods listing. We have also seen many investors trying to balance their portfolio and it has contributed to the volume of transactions recorded in the last three months.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Capital, however stated, \u201cIn the week ahead, we believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting to gain further clarity on the movement of yields in the fixed income market.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we expect a \u2018choppy theme\u2019, as cautious trading will likely dominate the market. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks, as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, investors have raced out of speculative corners of the US market, as the Federal Reserve moves to tighten financial conditions. It reported that share decline had been particularly extreme in the US, where many of last year\u2019s high-flying tech companies were listed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 7.6 per cent this week, its biggest slide since the coronavirus pandemic rocked US financial markets in March 2020.\n\nThe blue-chip S&P 500 index, the closely followed barometer of the $50 trillion US stock market, shed 5.7 per cent over the past week. More than two-thirds of the companies within the index are now in a technical correction \u2014 or down at least 10 per cent from their record high \u2014 including 149 stocks that declined 20 per cent or more.\n\nThe FTSE All-World index of developed and emerging market shares has fallen 4.2 per cent since last Friday, recording its steepest weekly decline since October 2020.\n\nAmong the hardest hit US stocks was Netflix, which tumbled 22 per cent on Friday after the streaming group warned subscriber growth would slow substantially. The decline shaved about $49bn from its valuation, or roughly the market capitalisation of foods group Kraft Heinz.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Exporters also guilty of under-invoicing\n\n*Action will preserve Nigeria\u2019s scarce forex\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has taken a major step to arrest the age-long practice of over-invoicing which dodgy importers and exporters have over the years used to cart away the nation\u2019s forex with its directive that effective February 1, 2022, all import and export operations would require the submission of an electronic invoice (e-invoice) authenticated by Authorised Dealer Banks (ADBs) on the Nigeria Single Window Price Portal \u2013 Trade Monitoring System (TRMS).\n\nA top central bank official who pleaded to remain anonymous, disclosed this in a chat with THISDAY yesterday, saying it would also help the country preserve forex.\n\nThe source reiterated that the new portal is a globally acceptable price monitoring platform where before a bank would open \u2018Form M\u2019 for a customer who wants to import, the price of the item being imported would be keyed into the portal.\n\nThe apex bank had explained in a circular at the weekend that the introduction of the e-valuator and e-Invoice would replace hard copy final invoice as part of the documentation required for all import and export transactions going forward.\n\nThe circular titled: \u201cGuidelines on the Introduction of E-Evaluator, E-Invoicing for Import and Export in Nigeria,\u201d signed by CBN Director, Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. Ozoemena Nnaji was directed to all authorised dealers and the price. The apex bank pointed out that the new regulation aims to achieve accurate value from import and export items in and out of the country.\n\nBut shedding more light on the new policy, the central bank insider explained: \u201cOver the last several years, the Nigerian economy has suffered from the challenge of over-invoicing by importers and under-invoicing by exporters. Through over-invoicing, unscrupulous importers are able to illegally wire monies out of the country and ship them abroad.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, exporters, because they under-invoice their exports, are also able to take some monies abroad and when this happens, what would come back home would be lower than the actual exports.\n\n\u201cSo, this portal is a globally acceptable price monitoring platform where before a bank can open \u2018Form M\u2019 for a customer who wants to import, the price of the item being imported is keyed into the portal. If that price that is being keyed into the portal is not more than 2.5 per cent above the globally acceptable price, the Form M is approved.\n\n\u201cBut, if the price quoted by the importer is higher than two per cent above the globally acceptable price, the Form M is rejected automatically. It is to save massive forex for the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the source alleged that most importers, whether Nigerians, Indians, Lebanese are involved in the illegal practice, \u201cand so this is a fantastic idea to stop all that nonsense.\u201d\n\nThe CBN circular had stated that the new system would operate on a Global Price Verification Mechanism guided by a benchmark price.\n\nThe benchmark price is the actual spot market price obtainable at the time of consummation of invoicing in that market where the goods are traded. The guideline however, provided exemptions from compliance with the new regulation for all individual invoices with a value of less than $10, 000 (or its equivalent in another currency), except where suppliers have an annual cumulative invoicing value equal to or above $500, 000 (or its equivalent in another currency).\n\nSuch would be required to submit their invoices regardless of the individual value of an invoice.\n\nExemptions were also granted to import and export transactions made by all security agencies in the country.\n\nAccording to the CBN, supplies to diplomatic and consular missions as well as international agencies dependent on the United Nations are further exempted from the regulation, including donations made to foreign governments or international organisations to foundations, charities and recognised humanitarian organisations \u2013 and goods directly supplied by a foreign government.\n\nThe circular added that fees, where relevant, shall be advised from time to time as the system progresses.\n\nEssentially, the guidelines stipulated that an importer/exporter of goods into Nigeria shall ensure that the purchase/sales contract with a foreign supplier/buyer stipulates compliance with the obligations set out in the regulation and that the supplier\u2019s/seller\u2019s invoice must be submitted in electronic format and authenticated by ADB as part of the documentation for payment.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Dangote Oil Refinery to Begin Production before Q3, 2022",
          "text": "*Business mogul\u2019s fortune up $1.3bn this year on cement firm gains\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Ugo Aliogo in Lagos with agency report\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest man, Aliko Dangote, said mechanical work on his much-awaited crude oil refinery located at the Lekki Free Zone, in Lagos State, had been completed and the facility would begin to run between August and September this year. Dangote disclosed this at the weekend in Lagos during a facility tour of the oil refinery, the fertiliser plant, and the Dangote Jetty, in the company of President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina.\n\nDangote said full production at the refinery could commence by the end of the year or the beginning of 2023. He lauded the AfDB president, and hinted that its polypropylene plant would yield about a million tonnes, which would bring $1.6 billion in terms of export revenue to the country. He assured his visitor that Dangote Group would continue to do more towards strengthening investment in the country, stating that the company has been meeting its tax obligations.\n\nDangote added that the Dangote Group had revitalised road infrastructure within Apapa and Isolo in Lagos, and also in Ogun and Kaduna, stressing that the group is equally involved in the development of deep seaports and other infrastructural projects across the country.\n\n\u201cHopefully, before the end of the third quarter we should be in the market,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe plant will start with a processing capacity of 540, 000 barrels per day, Dangote said, with full-fledged activities expected by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cFull production can start, maybe, by the end of the year or beginning of 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nThe facility, which will cost an estimated $19 billion to build, has an installed capacity of 650, 000 barrels per day and was earlier scheduled to begin operation by the first half of this year. Its output would be more than enough to meet Nigeria\u2019s fuel demand and turn Africa\u2019s largest crude producer into an exporter of refined crude.\n\nRecently, the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) estimated that beyond Nigeria, the refinery could reduce importation of petroleum products into the continent by as much as 36 per cent, according to Bloomberg.\n\nBesides, APPO stated that the success of the project could incentivise the rise of similar projects across Africa, despite the current focus on energy transition.\n\nSecretary General of the continental body, Dr Omar Farouk Ibrahim, had said the refinery would be supplying over 12 per cent of Africa\u2019s demand when operational.\n\nGroup Executive Director, Strategy, Portfolio Development and Capital Projects, Dangote Industries Limited, Devakumar Edwin, said the refinery complex, which includes a refinery, petrochemical plant, a fertiliser plant, and a subsea pipeline project, was the largest single-train refinery in the world. Edwin stated that the 650,000 barrels per day refinery would stimulate economic development in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Edwin, Dangote Petroleum Refinery can meet 100 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s requirement of all liquid products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and aviation jet), and also have surplus of each of these products for export.\n\nHe stated that this would create a market for $11 billion per annum of Nigerian crude and foreign exchange savings/earnings of $9.9 billion.\n\nEdwin stated, \u201cWe have impacted on job creation with 3,580 Nigerian personnel on site, excluding employment by the various contractors and subcontractors at the site.\u201d\n\nHe called on the federal government to harness the potential in the private sector as part of efforts to drive economic growth in the country.\n\nEdwin also explained that continued investment in infrastructure would lower the cost of doing business, noting that consistency and stability of power would drive more growth for business, \u201cand when investors put in a lot of money, that shows that there should be a lot for us to do.\n\n\u201cI think we also have to promote our own successes. We should celebrate our own business successes; we should support them and give them the chances to grow. We should provide them access to build a successful business environment in the country. Not just Dangote alone, but also the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), too, to grow and thrive more in agriculture, agribusiness, digital economy, creative industries, and others that require a lot of support.\u201d\n\nHe said strong support from government would go a long way in boosting business growth in the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the AfDB president described Dangote Refinery and Fertiliser projects as the best industrialised project to happen to Africa. He said the projects would not only positively affect Nigeria\u2019s economic growth and development, but Africa\u2019s as well.\n\nAdesina described Dangote as an enigma, who should be honoured in Africa and even beyond for his passion, vision, and determination to develop and ensure that Africa was transformed.\n\nHe added, \u201cOne of the things I admire the most about Alhaji Dangote is that, he actually believes in Nigeria, and he invests his money in Nigeria. He believes in Africa and invests in Africa.\n\n\u201cNobody could invest the type of billions of dollars that is here, unless the person not only has the vision but also the commitment and passion for his country. We are extremely proud of you and of your commitment to the continent.\n\n\u201cAliko is quite an inspirational and visionary business leader and for anybody to have done what I have seen here, I think that person deserves world class kudos for that. I see a company that I will proudly call Africa\u2019s growth accelerator company. With this project, we see an acceleration of how to reduce imports. We see an acceleration on how to have an outbound on export; a value chain development and how to compete regionally and globally.\n\n\u201cI am completely blown away with what I saw here today. I can\u2019t believe what I saw. This project will reverse the huge sum the nation spends on foreign exchange. When you look at how much we import, it is about $57 billion worth of different products and we export only about $50.4 billion.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to balance that with about $7 billion and talking to them here, they showed us that they can have a domestic market of about $11 billion and that is an incredible market and that will save Nigeria about $9 billion dollars a year from importing petroleum products. This is huge for Nigeria and even for Africa as a continent.\u201d\n\nOn the fertiliser complex, Adesina said, \u201cBeing a man passionate about agriculture, this is a company that is producing three million metric tonnes of urea, which will make Nigeria totally self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cNigeria will become net exporter of fertilisers. It will drive productivity growth in Nigeria, prices will come down and the quality will also improve.\u201d\n\nIn October 2021, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, stated that Nigeria\u2019s import of petroleum products using 30 per cent of its forex could be reversed by the successful commencement of operations by the Dangote refinery. Emefiele was speaking during a foreign investors\u2019 meeting held in New York while answering questions raised by foreign investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Dangote, originally a cement tycoon, is worth $20.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bloomberg reported that Dangote saw his fortune grow by $1.3 billion this month alone on the back of steep gains in the share price of his cement company.\n\nDangote Cement Plc, which accounts for about half the entrepreneur\u2019s net worth of $20.4 billion, closed at the highest since 2010 on Friday, having gained 11 per cent in 2022 compared with 7.4 per cent on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), stressed the report.\n\nThe Lagos-based company recently completed a share buyback to boost value.\n\nDangote is one of only 35 billionaires among the richest 100 ranked on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index that have seen their fortunes grow in January. India\u2019s richest person, Gautam Adani, is up the most, up $13 billion to $89.5 billion.\n\nThe Nigerian cement tycoon is set to boost his wealth by completing a $19 billion refinery project scheduled to start operations later this year. The crude processor has enough capacity to meet all the domestic fuel needs of Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, while also boosting exports.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Buhari\u2019s administration clueless, piling eternal debts, says Ayu\n\nJames Sowole\n\n\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday restated his vow not to return to partisan politics.\n\nObasanjo, 84, made this known when a delegation of the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, visited him at his residence in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nThis is coming as Ayu has described the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration as a clueless government that is piling eternal debts for future generations.\n\nThe PDP delegation during the meeting, held behind closed doors, dwelt extensively on the party\u2019s search for a suitable presidential candidate, who will wrestle power from the APC.\n\nThe National Secretary of the party, Senator Sam Anyanwu; the Deputy National Chairman, South and former Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Mr Taofeek Arapaja; other members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and the PDP vice presidential candidate in 2019 elections, Mr, Peter Obi, were part of the delegation.\n\nThe delegation also include a former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; a former governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and two former governors of Cross River State, Mr. Donald Duke, Senator Liyel Imoke; former Police Affairs Minister, Adamu Waziri, and former Minister of Special Duties, Tanimu Kabiru Turaki (SAN), were also among the PDP chieftains in attendance.\n\nA source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that the PDP leaders sought Obasanjo\u2019s contribution to the issue of zoning and the search for a formidable presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe visit was part of the wider consultations embarked upon by the PDP to strategise for the 2023 general election, especially the presidential election. They had fruitful discussions on the issue of zoning and the need to search for a suitable and credible presidential candidate,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, after the closed-door meeting, Obasanjo publicly told his guests to bear in mind that he was no longer in partisan politics.\n\nRecall that the former president had some years ago publicly announced that he was quitting politics, and tearing his PDP membership card in his house in Abeokuta.\n\nBut speaking yesterday, Obasanjo said: \u201cI have been with the party right from inception. Whatever I do in my own life, because I became president on the platform of PDP, PDP will continue to be part of the history of my life.\n\n\u201cBut having said that, the day that in my ward I decided to tear my PDP card was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP and that day I vowed that I will not be a member of any political party again, but I will remain a statesman in Nigeria, in West Africa, in Africa and indeed in the world.\u201d\n\nThe former president, who said the responsibilities on the shoulder of Ayu, were enormous, prayed that he would be able to carry them.\n\n\u201cYour case is like the case of Idi Amin of Uganda. Idi Amin came to me and he said \u2018my brother, you have Africa load and it is on your shoulder, I pray God will help you carry Africa load\u2019.\n\n\u201cIyorchia, you have PDP load with Nigeria load and it is only God that can help you to carry this load, which of course, I believe if God gives you a responsibility, He will also give you the wherewithal to be able to carry that responsibility.\n\n\u201cIn my hope, which is also some people\u2019s disappointment is that some of you who knew how things were done 21 years ago are still there but then some people will say here if you knew how it was done 21 years ago why have you not consistently be doing it? I think you can answer that, I will not answer for you, but if you ask me, I retired 14 years ago and I remain retired and I will remain retired by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cBut if I retired from partisan politics if politics is the welfare of the people, I must not retire from the welfare and well-being of people whether in my community, in my state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world and that is why I have the type of responsibility that I now have in the horn of Africa, which is not an easy responsibility, but it has to be done. But I will say that your responsibility is not an easy one either, but it has to be done.\n\n\u201cBut bear in mind and I want to emphasise that I\u2019m no longer in partisan politics and there is nothing that will bring me back to partisan politics, but I will always be interested in what is good for Nigeria and anybody who wants to have my advice, I will give it in the best interest of Nigeria and the best interest of Africa,\u201d Obasanjo explained.\n\nResponding, Ayu commended Obasanjo for what he did when he was Nigeria\u2019s president.\n\nHe described the President Muhammadu Buhari administration as clueless and piling eternal debts for this and future generations.\n\nAyu also described the present administration as wicked, pointing out that only a wicked regime would subject generations unborn to the servitude of slavery.\n\nNot done, the National Chairman blamed Buhari for the low in Nigeria\u2019s international reputation as an insecure country and the poverty capital of the world, a reversal of fortunes which he measured, were the direct opposite of the achievements of Obasanjo of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for the service you rendered and the great work you have done in the PDP as the first president.\n\n\u201cYour period as president under the platform of PDP was seen as the golden era of the PDP because not only did you grow the economy to be the biggest economy in Africa, you were able to eradicate Nigeria from slavery by negotiating and cancelling so much of our foreign debts that would have made it very difficult to run the country.\n\n\u201cBy the time you left office, Nigeria was set free, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was on the increase daily; we were respected in the international community, everywhere we went.\n\n\u201cI remember I accompanied you as your minister to some countries \u2013 Germany, Indian \u2013 I saw the respect they accorded you in India and I was very proud to be a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cToday, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the same recognition because what we have has fallen short of the leadership that Nigeria deserves.\n\n\u201cApart from the infrastructural intervention, which you did, most of the institutions, some of them are today useful\u2026 like EFCC, the ICPC and so on you- put it in place.\n\n\u201cI remember when you took some of us to Germany to the offices or the Transparency International and we had a very useful discussion there. So, you are very passionate about this country and you did a lot and we thought we should come and thank you for what you have done not to just Nigerians but our party and Africa.\n\n\u201cOver these years that you were in power, you saw every Nigerian as one family, you didn\u2019t discriminate against the South, the East, the West or the North. Even though in your first tenure, the South-west didn\u2019t actually support you, but you brought them back on board and they supported you in your second tenure,\u201d Ayu explained.\n\n\u201cIn Africa today, I think today, in all modesty, after the departure of President Mandela, there is only one person of such stature on the African continent and we are proud that that person is a Nigerian and that Nigerian is no other than President Olusegun Obasanjo and you have continued to display the leadership because it is wrong to address you as Nigerian leader or Yoruba leader or an Owu chief.\n\n\u201cEven though you retired from partisan politics, partisan politics will never retire from your blood, because you want the right thing done and since you want the right thing done, for the life you will remain the emeritus member of the PDP. You cannot build a house and leave it to collapse,\u201d Ayu told Obasanjo.\n\nHe promised the former president that the PDP would restore Nigeria\u2019s lost glory.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says campaigns start 90 days to elections\n\n*Vows to sanction violators of extant rules\n\nChuks Okocha\n\nWorried by the proliferation of billboards and campaign posters of some political parties and aspirants across the country, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned the parties and their various aspirants to wait for the official commencement of campaigns as provided by the law.\n\nThe electoral body noted that the law provides that campaigns in public shall commence 90 days before the polling day and end 24 hours before the election.\n\nThe commission has also warned of consequences awaiting the violators of campaign guidelines.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Information and Voter Education, Mr. Festus Okoye, told THISDAY yesterday that it was not yet time for campaigns and warned political parties, aspirants and their supporters to remain within the confines and ambit of the law and the 1999 Constitution, as well as the rules and regulations of the commission in carrying out their activities.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties, aspirants and their supporters are advised to wait for the release of the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election for proper guidance and assurance of conformity with the law and the constitution.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are aware that based on the existing law, the period for campaigning in public has not matured and has not come into force.\n\n\u201cAll the registered political parties must ensure that their supporters and aspirants on their various platforms do not carry out any form of campaign in public in violation of the law and the Constitution,\u201d Okoye warned.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, section 86(1) of the Electoral Act makes it mandatory that the commission shall keep records of the activities of all registered political parties and may seek information or clarification from any registered political party in connection with any activities of the political party which may be contrary to the provisions of the Constitution or any other law, guidelines, rules or regulations made pursuant to the Act,\u201d he added.\n\nThe INEC commissioner reminded the political parties that the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election have not been released by the commission.\n\nAccording to him, it is the duty of the commission to issue regulations, guidelines and manuals to give effect to the intendment of the law and the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBy Section 221 of the Constitution, no association, other than a political party shall canvass for votes for any candidate at any election or contribute to the funds of any political party or the election expenses of any candidate at an election.\n\n\u201cPart 1 of the Third Schedule to the Constitution gives the commission the power to monitor the organisation and operation of political parties, including their finances, conventions, congresses and party primaries.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Section 99 of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) prescribes and circumscribes the period of campaigning in public by political parties. Based on the existing law, campaigns in public shall commence 90 days before polling day and end 24 hours before that date. \u201cHowever, section 99 of the Act recognises that political parties are not the only operators in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, section 100 of the Act provides that a candidate and his party shall campaign in accordance with such rules and regulations as may be determined by the commission,\u201d the INEC commissioner further clarified.\n\nOkoye recalled that in the exercise of the powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the commission had issued regulations and guidelines for rallies and campaigns by political parties, aspirants, candidates and their supporters, adding that the document was signed by the Chairman of the commission, Professor Mahmood Yakubu on May 31, 2018.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A lawsuit demanding Kanu's fundamental human rights had been instituted at the court.\n\nJustice Benson Anya of the Abia court had said in the last court proceedings on December 10 that the parties will receive notice on the date the court will render its judgment.\n\nKanu is facing charges of treasonable felony levelled against him by the Nigerian government, but Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had adjourned his case till next year, January 18.\n\nEjimakor said, \"It is my hope as his lawyer that he will not spend Christmas in detention, but we don't have any court case this year again.\n\n\"The Abuja case is next year January 18, while the Umuahia has been concluded but we have to wait for when they will call us for judgment.\"\n\nSimilarly, Igboho, who was arrested by the Republic of Benin authorities at the Cotonou Airport on July 19, 2021, has since been in a detention facility in the neighbouring country.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters on Thursday, Pelumi Olajengbesi, one of the activist's counsel said the chances of getting Igboho out of prison in 2021 is very slim.\n\nHe, however, does not rule out the possibility of Igboho's release as he added that efforts were being made to secure his release.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the hope of getting him released this year is still very slim. There are diplomatic consultations going on in respect of that because as you know, Igboho in the eyes of the law is a very free person, he has committed no crime.\n\n\u201cWe know he's being held against his will. He's a prisoner of conscience and so we believe that he will be out soon but I can't guarantee he will be out before the end of this year. There are lots of diplomatic discussions going on in that regard.\u201d\n\nConcerning the health of the agitator which had sometime ago been reportedly failing, Olanengbesi stated, \u201cI can tell you right now that Chief Sunday Igboho is hale and hearty, very motivated, a very strong person. If you know him very closely, you will know he is a very courageous person. We continue to pray that God gives him more strength to remain focused.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported efforts made by some major pro-Yoruba bodies to get Igboho out of jail, including holding protests to register their displeasure at his continued detention.\n\nIn November, Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua announced that it had begun the movement to secure the release of Igboho.\n\nThe group disclosed this during the inauguration of its Elders Advisory Council in Ibadan.\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Agbekoya Solidarity Movement of Nigeria, representing the interest of farmers in Ibadan, Oyo State, took to the streets to call for the immediate release of the activist.\n\nThe protesters started the protest from Mapo Hall in Ibadan, carrying placards boldly demanding the release of Igboho who they claimed was fighting for their rights.\n\nThe group had approached the palace of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, with a letter stating their demands.\n\n\n\nThey requested that the king present the letter to President Muhammadu Buhari on their behalf.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian-American philanthropist, Toyin Dawodu urged the Benin Republic government to immediately release Igboho from detention.\n\nDawodu, in a statement, warned that the Beninese government must ensure the adequate release of the activist within seven days or \u201cface serious consequences of the nature of an economic embargo that as a country, it may never recover from, in a very long time.\u201d",

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about four years, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. While still running his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\nChari\u2019s warehouse\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nThis Saturday was Techpoint Build 2021, and it was the thing!!!!! From the Speaker line-up, which in our Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 words, was \u201cmad!!!\u201d to the different sessions on the next frontier in healthtech, fintech, edtech, and fintech to the massive turnout. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen that many people at an event \u2014 granted, I\u2019m a homebody, but still.\n\nIn this newsletter, I will be doing a quick recap for those who \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 missed it. I\u2019m nice that way.\n\nSome Techpoint Build 2021 nuggets for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the keynote speaker: This year\u2019s keynote speaker for Techpoint Build was Adia Sowho, MTN Nigeria\u2019s CMO. The theme for this event was \u201cThe next frontier\u201d, and while she touched on several things, she said something that caused my data privacy-o-meter to hit the roof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe tend to import philosophies into the products we build in Africa even though we\u2019re behind in many things. For instance, data privacy. Create data that not only supports your decision making but also of those around you.\u201d Something to chew on, I\u2019ll say.\n\nWhat COVID-19 can do does not exist: It\u2019s not what you are thinking; this is a good thing. During Emmanuel Paul\u2019s session with Ifeanyi Duru, VP at Monnify, the evolution of the digital payment sector was on the front burner and how almost every startup has payments integrated now. All thanks to the coronavirus, of course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeanyi Duru, Monnify VP, speaking at Techpoint Build 2021\n\nNot just digital payments, though: In Oluwanifemi\u2019s session with Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, CEO Healthtracka; Ikpeme Neto, CEO Wellahealth; and Abimbola Adebakin, CEO Advantage Health Africa, COVID-19\u2019s role in people\u2019s perception of public health was discussed. Some emphasis was also laid on the importance of private-public collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthetech panel at Techpoint Build 2021. L-R: Oluwanifemi Kolawole, Senior Reporter, Techpoint Africa; Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, CEO, Healthtracka; Ikpeme Neto, CEO, Wellahealth; and Abimbola Adebakin, CEO, Advantage Health Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s still a bit to unpack, but Precious will be doing a more rounded job in the coming week. From Bolu\u2019s talk with Ruth Iselema, CEO Bitmama, to Tayo Aina\u2019s session with Akinnuga Abayomi COO, Tramango to Faiz Bashir, CEO Flexisaf\u2019s overview on edtech, there were a lot of insights and take-homes.\n\nPitchstorm\u2026 and the winner is: Another exciting part of the event was the Pitchstorm competition, showcasing a host of amazing startups riding the next frontier wave. With seven semi-finalists pitching at Techpoint Build 2021, Ghanaian company, WorldTech Consult emerged the winner, carting home $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldTech Consult, Pitchstorm 3.0 winner\n\nBut they weren\u2019t the only winners. To crown Techpoint Build 2021 activities, Techpoint Awards 2021 was held on Sunday, January 23, 2022, recognising some of the startups pushing boundaries in the ecosystem.\n\nNomination-only: Judged by an independent panel, this category saw startups like Paga win the Financial Inclusion Startup of the year, Patricia win Crypto exchange of the year, Thepeer win Newbie of the year, God is Good Logistics win Mobility and Logistics startup of the year, among others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThepeer wins Newbie of the year\n\nEditorial choice: This category was judged by Techpoint\u2019s Editorial team based on nominations from our audience. We saw Piggyevst win Startup of the year and Ingressive Capital judged as the most outstanding VC in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAudience choice: Winners in this category were chosen by our readers and saw Fisayo Fosudo named Tech Influencer of the year and Abeg named App of the year. Here\u2019s a complete list of all the winners and, if you\u2019re interested, a breakdown of how we chose them.\n\nIt\u2019s a wrap: I thoroughly enjoyed Techpoint Build 2021 \u2014 first time at a Build event \u2014 and if you attended the event, I\u2019m sure you did too.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s small businesses in unending battle against dollar shortages",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s small businesses are locked in a survival battle against a foreign exchange crisis that is forcing them to adapt or die trying.\n\nMicro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) are regarded as the core of the economy, seeing that they provide platforms with which the economy can grow and develop.\n\nThis group of businesses has significantly contributed to economic growth through job creation, revenue generation, economic diversification, etc.\n\nNigeria has 39.6 million Nano, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (NMSMEs), who currently account for 96.9 percent of businesses in the country, provide 87.9 percent of employment and contribute 46.31 percent of the national GDP, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nHowever, their huge number and significant contribution to economic growth do not exempt them from challenges that make them vulnerable to closure and frustration, especially those primarily involved in wholesale and retail trade.\n\nFor the 23.23 million businesses (58.6%) involved in wholesale and retail trade, 33.3 percent of which are micro-enterprises, buying products abroad, receiving them, and eventually selling the products are different stages of business that has their own peculiar and stressful challenge.\n\nMost of them deal in the sale of clothes, household kits, shoes, electronics, among other things, primarily sourcing the products from China, Dubai, the United States, and Europe. Many of these businesses have not been privileged to travel to these places to carry out transactions, however, the use of technology has enabled the almost seamless buying and selling activity.\n\nOne major problem that stresses transactions for these businesses is the payment system which stacks the odds against them. To start with, the Nigerian naira is quite weak against the dollar which predominantly serves as a mutually accepted currency between these countries.\n\nCurrently, it costs N415 to get one dollar from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), while it costs no less than N550 in the parallel market, this unfavourable exchange rate affects them as they are forced to pay more for fewer products. In addition to this, sourcing the dollar currency is another major problem they face as it is not readily available in banks.\n\nBefore the pandemic, small businesses sourced dollars through agents who got the sought-after currency after aggregating different orders as one request tangible enough to receive attention.\n\nIn August 2020, the CBN issued a directive that restricted third parties or middlemen from accessing the FX window through the form M, this further tightened access to FX for SMEs because they do not have the capacity to, and many of them can not connect with the original producers of these things neither do they have the financial ability to purchase thousands of dollars at once.\n\nFollowing a directive from the financial regulator, Nigeria banks pegged the monthly dollar limit between $100 and $200 on the naira MasterCard, which limits the amount business owners can use on their debit cards. Even with the use of a dollar card, there is a limit of about $3000 per month.\n\nHow businesses managed payments\n\nFacing different policies that threatened to stifle business operations, MSMEs devised means to solve the payment system challenges. Most MSMEs when shopping from China, prefer to use the Yuan because it is relatively cheaper and allows a diverse option of suppliers howbeit with different rates.\n\nOguntoyinbo Olayinka, founder, WOW Superstores who deals in clothes and accessories, says she has a currency supplier in China and the USA that helps her pay in their own currency and she refunds them in their naira wallet, a plan she says has served her well since 2019.\n\n\u201cI do not rely on one source of payment to avoid disappointments and I sometimes use Alipay when buying from China, also due to the $100 limit, I have to spread the payment across many accounts or use different cards when other options are not available the naira equivalent is then deducted from my account,\u201d she explains.\n\nAkhuewu Jennifer, who owns Bliss & Bloom Nigeria, states that she buys goods from Turkey, Dubai, and China, depending on the item and type of product, and makes payment however the supplier prefers to be paid.\n\n\u201cI make payments using the Naira debit card, WeChat, and other mobile applications where you can reach agents and suppliers directly, due to the exchange rate before making payment I compare the available rates of different suppliers and go with the most suitable one,\u201d she says.\n\nAsking if she tried using banks to pay directly, she says, \u201cIn 2021, I tried getting $2500 from my bank directly so I can travel with it and sort out payments, it took them almost 10days to even process it and I still did not get it despite presenting different documents, I had to go back to my agents to buy even though it was much more expensive.\u201d\n\nAkhuewu notes that the unfavorable exchange rate is a major problem especially as it changes without prior notice and consequently erodes their profit. Tracking and confirming payment also poses problems as Nigerians are always suspected to be fraudulent which permanently makes suppliers distrust them.\n\n\u201cAfter payment has been made, you have to hope that it is confirmed quickly and that the network does not tamper with the flow of activities especially when you are using an online platform, you may be debited while the other person may not be credited,\u201d she states.\n\nFintech start-ups have also created buffers that help mitigate the stress of paying through its products offerings.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s small businesses are locked in a survival battle against a foreign exchange crisis that is forcing them to adapt or die trying.\n\nMicro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) are regarded as the core of the economy, seeing that they provide platforms with which the economy can grow and develop.\n\nThis group of businesses has significantly contributed to economic growth through job creation, revenue generation, economic diversification, etc.\n\nNigeria has 39.6 million Nano, Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (NMSMEs), who currently account for 96.9 percent of businesses in the country, provide 87.9 percent of employment and contribute 46.31 percent of the national GDP, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nHowever, their huge number and significant contribution to economic growth do not exempt them from challenges that make them vulnerable to closure and frustration, especially those primarily involved in wholesale and retail trade.\n\nFor the 23.23 million businesses (58.6%) involved in wholesale and retail trade, 33.3 percent of which are micro-enterprises, buying products abroad, receiving them, and eventually selling the products are different stages of business that has their own peculiar and stressful challenge.\n\nMost of them deal in the sale of clothes, household kits, shoes, electronics, among other things, primarily sourcing the products from China, Dubai, the United States, and Europe. Many of these businesses have not been privileged to travel to these places to carry out transactions, however, the use of technology has enabled the almost seamless buying and selling activity.\n\nOne major problem that stresses transactions for these businesses is the payment system which stacks the odds against them. To start with, the Nigerian naira is quite weak against the dollar which predominantly serves as a mutually accepted currency between these countries.\n\nCurrently, it costs N415 to get one dollar from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), while it costs no less than N550 in the parallel market, this unfavourable exchange rate affects them as they are forced to pay more for fewer products. In addition to this, sourcing the dollar currency is another major problem they face as it is not readily available in banks.\n\nBefore the pandemic, small businesses sourced dollars through agents who got the sought-after currency after aggregating different orders as one request tangible enough to receive attention.\n\nIn August 2020, the CBN issued a directive that restricted third parties or middlemen from accessing the FX window through the form M, this further tightened access to FX for SMEs because they do not have the capacity to, and many of them can not connect with the original producers of these things neither do they have the financial ability to purchase thousands of dollars at once.\n\nFollowing a directive from the financial regulator, Nigeria banks pegged the monthly dollar limit between $100 and $200 on the naira MasterCard, which limits the amount business owners can use on their debit cards. Even with the use of a dollar card, there is a limit of about $3000 per month.\n\nHow businesses managed payments\n\nFacing different policies that threatened to stifle business operations, MSMEs devised means to solve the payment system challenges. Most MSMEs when shopping from China, prefer to use the Yuan because it is relatively cheaper and allows a diverse option of suppliers howbeit with different rates.\n\nOguntoyinbo Olayinka, founder, WOW Superstores who deals in clothes and accessories, says she has a currency supplier in China and the USA that helps her pay in their own currency and she refunds them in their naira wallet, a plan she says has served her well since 2019.\n\n\u201cI do not rely on one source of payment to avoid disappointments and I sometimes use Alipay when buying from China, also due to the $100 limit, I have to spread the payment across many accounts or use different cards when other options are not available the naira equivalent is then deducted from my account,\u201d she explains.\n\nAkhuewu Jennifer, who owns Bliss & Bloom Nigeria, states that she buys goods from Turkey, Dubai, and China, depending on the item and type of product, and makes payment however the supplier prefers to be paid.\n\n\u201cI make payments using the Naira debit card, WeChat, and other mobile applications where you can reach agents and suppliers directly, due to the exchange rate before making payment I compare the available rates of different suppliers and go with the most suitable one,\u201d she says.\n\nAsking if she tried using banks to pay directly, she says, \u201cIn 2021, I tried getting $2500 from my bank directly so I can travel with it and sort out payments, it took them almost 10days to even process it and I still did not get it despite presenting different documents, I had to go back to my agents to buy even though it was much more expensive.\u201d\n\nAkhuewu notes that the unfavorable exchange rate is a major problem especially as it changes without prior notice and consequently erodes their profit. Tracking and confirming payment also poses problems as Nigerians are always suspected to be fraudulent which permanently makes suppliers distrust them.\n\n\u201cAfter payment has been made, you have to hope that it is confirmed quickly and that the network does not tamper with the flow of activities especially when you are using an online platform, you may be debited while the other person may not be credited,\u201d she states.\n\nFintech start-ups have also created buffers that help mitigate the stress of paying through its products offerings. For example, Flutterwave\u2019s Barter is a web and mobile app that allows individuals to send and receive money abroad, it also allows users to create unlimited virtual dollar cards for transactions that can be funded with a naira wallet. It can be used on most global payment sites.\n\nDespite finding a way around the payment issues, MSMEs also face other problems confirming payments to suppliers and also tracking the movement of their goods.\n\nShipping cost\n\nAfter successfully paying for products, businesses also have to work around shipping costs, shipping delays, and tracking items.\n\n\u201cSometimes the cost of sending your products is more than the price of items ordered because each item has its own shipping cost calculated in dollars,\u201d Oguntoyinbo says.\n\nShe adds that when the items are sent, receiving them has additional cost except there is a private shipper between both parties which still does not totally eliminate the cost.

          "text": "The failure of the government to formalise the operations of over 34 million informal Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria has continued to minimise the potential of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that, of 39,654,385 total MSMEs in Nigeria, 34,413,420 operate informally, which makes it impossible for the government to regulate and harness full benefits from them, particularly in terms of taxes.\n\nAs contained in the report of the 2020 MSMEs survey jointly conducted by the NBS and Small and MEDIUM Enterprise Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), the total assets of the MSMEs were valued at N8.41 trillion in 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic induced challenges that affected global business earnings.\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done to formalise this sector, we cannot fully optimise the potential of our economy, and the growth expected cannot be actualised because the informal space is still very huge,\u201d Johnson Chukwu, MD/CEO of Cowry Asset Management Limited, told BusinessDay over the phone.\n\nChukwu is particularly worried that Nigerians, over the years, have become accustomed to a cultural structure of a business, which makes it difficult for businesses to get formalised.\n\nAccording to him, most business structures in Nigeria are patterned based on family lineage, and mentorship, making it almost impossible for them to attract investors.\n\nThe contribution of MSMEs to the Nigerian economy cannot be over-emphasized and therefore regarded as the bedrock of the economy.\n\nIn Nigeria, MSMEs contributed 46.31 percent of the national GDP and also accounted for 6.21 percent of gross exports. Micro Enterprises (MEs) accounted for 96.9 percent of businesses and 87.9 percent of employment.\n\nDespite the epochal contribution of MSMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges that impede the growth and development of the sector abound.\n\n\u201cThere is no concerted effort in place to incorporate the activities of these businesses as well as train people in business. Hence, undermining the potential of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cFor example, most operations in the retail sector are informal, hence lack of adequate financing and skills,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MSMEs survey was undertaken to understand their characteristics and activities and the government hopes to incorporate findings into its programmes, policies, and intervention within the sector.\n\nChukwu believes that offering incentives to small business owners could go a long way in encouraging formalisation of their operations.\n\nHe further harped on the need for the government to intervene in the activities of the small businesses as many are faced with challenges including poor access to finance, poor infrastructure, and technical know-how, among others.\n\nIbrahim Isah, an Abuja-based economic analyst, notes that the informal sector is economically efficient and possesses comparative advantages in relation to similar activities developed in the formal sector.\n\nThe sector also has the capacity to produce positive economic effects as they provide sources of livelihood and economic opportunities that may be unavailable in the formal sector.\n\nHe, therefore, stresses the need for the government to scale down regulatory barriers, and remove unnecessary bureaucracies for the informal workforce.\n\n\u201cAn increasing tax burden and rising state regulatory activities are the major driving forces determining the size and growth of the informal economy.\n\n\u201cEconomic institutions exercise an important influence on whether or not one registers a business because they influence the costs of entry, of doing business, and of exit,\u201d he says.\n\nRead also: FG implements O.5% GDP allocation to promote tech, innovation\n\nThe results of the survey also indicate that despite the marginal increase of 3.7 percent in the sector\u2019s employment when 2017 is compared to 2020, there was a decrease of 3.5 percent in the contribution to GDP.\n\nAlso, the number of business enterprises in 2020 was 39,654,385 as against 41,543,028 reported in 2017, indicating a decrease of 4.5 percent. The report notes the reduction could be a result of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, Chijioke Ekechukwu, former director-general of Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, raised the concerns that most MSMEs may close down if formalised.\n\nAccording to him, most of them thrive because their operations are free from the control of the government.\n\n\u201cEvery economy in the world has both the formal and informal sectors, but what is important is for us to have a credible database, which will enable the government to tax them accordingly.\n\n\u201cIf we want to talk about formalizing these businesses, many will be forced to shut down. They raise capital by themselves, struggle to sustain the business by themselves, formalizing their activities will mean the government will have control over them, which may not be to their advantage.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Blessing Asu, owner of \u2018Lady B boutique,\u2019 states that for over five years that she has operated her business, she is yet to see the need to register the business.\n\nShe explains that her initial capital was below N100,000, which was raised through savings and support from families.\n\nShe says, \u201cI like the way I am quietly running my business here without the government coming to disturb me or ask for tax.\n\n\u201cI have been in this business since 2017, I travel to Onitsha and sometimes Lagos to purchase my wares and sell. If I register this business now, I may have to start paying tax from the small money I\u2019m making here. At least, I\u2019m able to pay three staff and generate income for myself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not getting anything from the government, why should I submit my business to them.\u201d",

          "title": "Climate activist, Obasi rallies African youths to demand more commitment in effort against climate change",
          "text": "Prince Emeka Obasi Jnr., a climate activist and founder of \u2018Our Tomorrow Foundation,\u2019 a non governmental organisation leading an African focused campaign against climate chance, has emphasized the need for the youths of the continent to wake up to the reality of the danger climate change poses to their future and begin to demand action from policy makers.\n\nObasi, a Nigerian born British undergraduate who spoke in this interview, regretted that despite the huge threat climate change poses to the survival of the African continent, there is still little awareness among the people of the continent, particularly the youths. This, he said, has to change, and according to him, it\u2019s part of the reason he thought it necessary to come up with an NGO to drive the change.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nRecently, you launched a climate NGO, \u2018Our Tomorrow.\u2019 Tell us about the initiative and what prompted you to set it up?\n\nBasically, I decided to set up the NGO because I was alarmed by the lack of awareness about the dangers of climate change on the continent, and the lack of urgency in tackling the crisis in Nigeria and the rest of Africa. Particularly, I noticed that there is this lack of awareness among the youths about the dangers of climate change. I often use my experience as an example to highlight this lack of awareness. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria in 2001 and would spend the first 15 years of my life in the country. But it\u2019s strange that despite being interested in current affairs, especially given that my father is a Journalist, I never became aware of the environmental crisis which had begun to endanger Lagos until I came to England for my college education in 2017. As I wrote in my letter to African youths some days ago, it was while here in England that I became increasingly aware of the problems of the environment and the challenges they pose, particularly to African countries. So my idea is to create this awareness and to galvanize the youths to begin to demand action from policy makers with regard to tackling the issues that lead to climate change and its effects.\n\nBut specifically, what can we expect from the NGO? What will it be doing in this regard?\n\nSpecifically, Our Tomorrow has three broad agenda: the first is to wake African youths up to the reality of climate change and the threat it poses to their future. The second is to sensitize African leaders, both those in government and those in the corporate environment, to begin to heed the clarion call for sustained action against climate change. Thirdly, to mobilize resources, both material and human resources, to create sustained awareness of Africans, particularly the youths on the need to be actively involved in this battle to save our environment for future generations.\n\nWhat activities do you have, or pan to drive these objectives?\n\nYes, we will be holding a press conference on Tuesday, January 25th at the University of Lagos to formally announce the NGO. Our website is also live and we will be laying out some of our activities there. We intend to launch the NGO formerly in London in the coming months. But between the time of the press conference and the formal launch in London, I\u2019ll be traveling to different African countries and different states across Nigeria such as Kebbi, Rivers Anambra and so on, to observe the impact of climate change in these environments. Subsequently, I will travel across Africa, to places like Rwanda, Kenya and some other countries to continue to create this awareness about climate crisis. I believe it is important for people to begin to visualise the threat of climate change. I believe that\u2019s the way it will be easier to highlight its seriousness to be able to mobilize action.\n\nBut do you think that in a continent where majority of the people are still concerned about what to eat, many will consider climate change such a big issue to bother about? I mean, why should they care?\n\nWell, I agree with you that the socioeconomic realities of our continent is an issue. But I also think that there is a general misunderstanding about the climate change crisis. It is not a zero-sum game. I mean, people tend to think that they would rather be addressing the problem of hunger and poverty than be concerned about climate change. But in reality, there is a link and I will explain to you how. Climate change is already a huge problem and a big threat to food security and security in general in Africa, and it is likely going to get worse if it is not urgently tackled. Obviously, it is already contributing to food insecurity, population displacement, and it is going to put a lot of stress on water resources. Studies have shown that coastal degradation and erosion are going to be major challenge in West Africa. About 56% of the coastlines in Benin Republic, Ivory Coast, and Senegal are already eroding. You have erosion in many parts of Nigeria, such as the south-east. You can see the encroaching desertification in the north, which has hugely contributed to the security crisis we are witnessing in the region and the food crisis in Nigeria. The farmers versus herders crisis is largely driven by climate change. We are seeing the impact. Farmers are not able to go to the farms, which means that food supply is affected. Prices of food are going up as a result.\n\nSo, climate crisis is going to affect agriculture significantly and when you consider the fact that agriculture is the backbone of the African economy, employing millions of people, you will begin to appreciate the enormity of the problem that presently confront us. So, yes climate change should be the concern of the average African, whether rich or poor because at the end of the day, it is a problem that affects everybody. First of all, food has become more expensive. So, I think everybody should be concerned about what is happening to our climate and indeed it is everybody\u2019s problem and demands that everybody begins to talk about it and begins to demand action from those that have the capacity to make changes.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you have highlighted the threats of climate change here. But it doesn\u2019t seem to matter so much to policy makers on the continent. Have you seen significant action on their part in this regard?\n\nUnfortunately, No. I don\u2019t think policy makers on the continent have done enough, quite frankly. However, increasingly, I think more people are beginning to realise the threat that climate change poses. For example, I saw the president of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari speaking at the recently concluded conference on climate change at Glasgow, Scotland, COP26. He did a good job of highlighting the need for developed countries to step up the effort in tackling climate change. But at the same time, I think African leaders need to increasingly vocalise the danger climate change poses to everyday lives of people on the continent; the dangers it poses to farming and to the stability of the continent in general.\n\nI also think it\u2019s important to also have collaboration among the countries on the continent, because at the end of the day it is a continental problem; it is indeed a global problem. But we can begin to tackle it at the continental level, particularly in sub-saharan Africa. There needs to be collaboration, for instance, among ECOWAS countries, the southern African countries, the Central African states, the East African countries and so on. What is important is that there should be collaborative effort across the board. Individual states taking action on their own may not achieve much results. Better results will be achieved when states come together to take serious steps against, for instance, desertification, by pooling resources together, to consider for instance afforestation. There should also be preventive actions which could be led by the United Nations or the African Union. That\u2019s some of the things that we should be looking at. Africa should work together and collaboratively with other parts of the world to achieve better results.\n\nYou pointed out that Buhari demanded more action from the developed world at COP26. I mean, that\u2019s a sentiment many people share given that these developed countries are mostly responsible for the climate crisis we face?\n\nOf course, this is a sentiment that I also share. The developed world must take the lead in the fight against climate change, simply because they are responsible for most of the global emissions. The developed world must help fund the fight against climate change in the developing world also because we do not have the resources in this part of the world to effectively deal with effects of climate change. And then, when you consider that the issues of climate we face on the continent were brought about by mostly the activities of the advanced economies \u2013 Africa contributes only 5% of global emissions \u2013 it becomes important that the developed world begin to take the lead in terms of funding initiative aimed at tackling climate change.\n\nIndeed, during the recently concluded climate change events held in Glasgow, the climate pact to deliver $100 billion dollars a year to African countries most affected by climate change was finalized. So, to that extent, I think there are gradual steps towards helping developing countries contain the effect of climate change. But I think a lot still needs to be done because of the enormity of the challenge. But as I said earlier, African countries cannot fold their arms and wait for the advanced economics to do everything. There should also be action from the leaders of the continent.\n\nYou are in the UK, and as you pointed out, you became aware about issues of climate there. But I also know that in UK and the rest of the Western world, there is climate denialism. How much of a challenge is it to the quest of tackling climate change?\n\nOf course, climate change denialism is a very serious problem, especially in the West. You know, it is ironic that even though the West is largely responsible for the climate catastrophe that now confront us, they are going to be the least impacted by it, compared to countries in Africa and other developing regions of the world. So, it is easy for some individuals there to deny the impact of climate change, or to deny the existence of climate change, like the past president of the United States. So, what you see is that these people have promoted resentment against some of the initiatives that are being developed to tackle climate change, and even resentment against the idea that developing countries should be helped to fund climate initiatives. It is a very big problem, but thankfully it is also changing gradually. Some of the public figures who were at the forefront of climate change denialism have been voted out of power. In the United States for example, since Joe Biden became president, the country has rejoined the Climate Accord that was first signed in 2015. We have seen encouraging signs that the international community is back on track as a united front against climate change.The denialists are being denied some of the voice that they used to have.\n\nThe quest you have embarked upon is a noble one, but you are a student. This sort of campaign requires resources. Have you thought about that?\n\nYes, but that\u2019s not an issue we are dwelling on. I mean, this is not about the traditional fundraising. I am more interested in developing more innovative approach to the issue of funding. But it\u2019s too early to talk about these things now. We would rather pursue our objectives now. Our concern is to ensure that we get our message across to youths of Africa and to influence policies aimed at tackling the impact of climate change. And of course, in finance once you create a good product, there will always be market for it. So, the issue of funding is secondary. The primary thing is building a critical mass to push the agenda of tackling climate change.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to note that while most of the discussions about climate change have centered on the cost of action against it, experts have continued to warn that cost of inaction is much higher. And we are talking hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the decade, probably much worse. Consider for instance, what Africa would lose if the Sahel region is allowed to cave in to desertification. It would destroy wildlife and the livelihoods of millions. Certainly, the cost of planting trees, etc, to ensure that the region continues to support lives will be little in comparison. These are some of the the things we need to make people, especially policy makers, understand. It wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea if a fraction of that cost is dedicated to awareness campaigns.\n\nWhat is your message to the youths of Africa who are the focus of your NGO?\n\nFor me, the message is for them; the youths of Africa, to wake up to the reality of climate, change knowing that we are the leaders of tomorrow. We are the inheritors of this continent and must begin to fight to ensure that the continent we inherit from our parents is not one that will be riddled in crisis; one where food insecurity and famine will become the order of the day. We must also remember that we have an obligation to leave this continent a better place for those coming after us. So, we must begin to do something today.\n\nI will say to us that the future of the continent is in their hands and is it is up to us to ensure that today\u2019s leaders take action to ensure that tomorrow we are not left with a landscape that is beset by draught, desertification, erosion, food insecurity, among others. So we should all wake up and take charge of our future and demand action from our present leaders. It is a duty we owe to ourselves and to the generations coming after us and we cannot fail. We cannot afford to betray that duty. For me, it is a struggle of a lifetime; one that I feel very honoured to answer and one that I hope every youth of the continent should be honoured to answer.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s vice president, Yemi Osinbajo has appealed to the global community to fulfill the $100b pledged to African countries for mitigation of climate change activities\n\nOsinbajo who made the plea in his presentation at the virtual edition of the 2022 World Economic Forum featuring leaders from across the world, urged the international community to \u201cmeet its pledge recently re-affirmed at COP-26 of providing $100 billion annually in climate finance to support climate change efforts in developing countries.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian vice president noted that although Africans are working towards the globally accepted net-zero future, they are also conscious that \u201cour energy needs are increasing with the growth in our economies.\u201d\n\nAccording to him to him, \u201cWe need to ramp up energy access in response to this situation which is why the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies must be just and fair.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that despite the giant strides recorded across Africa, the Continent still has challenges to overcome.\n\nHe stated that we need partnerships that help to tackle climate change, address security concerns, promote economic prosperity, combat disease, and improve governance.\n\nThe 2022 virtual edition of the forum features a mix of visionary \u201cstate of the world\u201d special addresses and ambitious high-level leadership panels focusing on critical collective challenges, among others.\n\nOsinbajo listed some of the progress on the African continent, including the recovery from the global pandemic, economic growth by 3.7 percent last year, and a projected 3.8 percent growth in 2022. He also noted that there is now in place an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to fast-track economic transformation just as the continent is making giant strides in agriculture, manufacturing, and digital technology. He added that in Nigeria for instance, 6 unicorns have emerged in the past six years.\n\nOn the issue of peace and security, the Vice President said \u201cAfrican countries face a serious threat of terrorism arising from the encroachment of global terror groups and their franchises into Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative for the international community to make more robust interventions to clear terrorists from Africa just as it did in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The United Nations Security Council must find unanimity in working with and assisting African countries to eradicate the menace of terrorism in the continent once and for all.\u201d\n\nOn the climate change challenge, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cit is now common knowledge that Africa contributes least to climate change but has been most negatively affected by it. We must not allow this worrying situation to be compounded further by global inaction, processes, and rules that make it difficult for Africa to adapt to climate change or indeed to develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are emphatic in our view that natural gas which Africa has in abundance must be accepted as a transition fuel. Moves in the international community especially by development finance institutions to defund gas projects will have severe implications in the medium to long-term for African economies and will slow down the process of phasing out more polluting fuels such as coal, diesel, and heavy fuel oil (HFO),\u201d he added.\n\nIn addition to climate finance, the Vice President called for a partnership to tackle poverty, access vaccinations, and achieve debt sustainability.\n\n\u201cEconomic recovery in Africa is contingent on the containment of the pandemic including through wide-spread vaccinations. Right now, less than 10% of African countries have vaccinated 40% of their population.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that due to resource constraints, there will be a relatively slow rollout of vaccinations in Africa and that full national rollouts may take several years.\n\n\u201cThe international community must accordingly support Africa with the resources including vaccine doses that will assist in making vaccinations available to all,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo emphasized.\n\nAnother point made by the VP in his special address is the call on the international community to support African countries overcome fiscal challenges arising from their limited revenues.\n\nAccording to Prof. Osinbajo, \u201cthe creation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights last year was a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to enable African and other developing countries access the SDRs that are not needed or being used by developed or emerging economies.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also urged multilateral organizations to consider the huge obligations placed on African countries and adopt debt relief initiatives such as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments in a manner that will not further constrain the resumption of growth to the continent.\n\nHe called on the international community to support the efforts of West African leaders under the auspices of ECOWAS particularly, their condemnation of the incidences of coup d\u2019etats and unconstitutional changes in government.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

He said he decided to shop at Toga Fashion House, Awka, because he believed that it will give a great mileage to the business which he said currently creates job for a lot of people and provides quality fashion products for the society.\n\nRecall that as Governor and thereafter, Obi has continued to patronize local industries. Speaking recently, the Managing Director of Innoson Motors, Chief Innocent Chukwuma, said that the support Obi gave him was what is still sustaining him, because it opened doors for the company\u2019s advancement.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Security sources have told AFP that mutinous troops in restive Burkina Faso arrested President Christian Kabore on Monday and kept him in army barracks a day after sparking an uprising.\n\nSoldiers at various army camps around the West African country rose up on Sunday, demanding the dismissal of the military\u2019s top brass as well as additional resources to combat a brutal jihadist insurgency.\n\nLater in the day gunshots were heard near Kabore\u2019s private residence in the capital Ouagadougou, and witnesses reported seeing a helicopter above it.\n\n\u201cPresident Kabore, the head of parliament and the ministers are effectively in the hands of the soldiers\u201d at the Sangoule Lamizana barracks in the capital Ouagadougou, a security source said, with another source confirming the arrest.\n\nThe situation was tense and confused in the capital, where mobile internet had been cut on Sunday, making it difficult to verify rumours of a coup in progress.\n\nAn AFP journalist said around 10 hooded troops had posted themselves in front of the national broadcaster RTB on Monday, but it was not immediately clear if they were from the mutineers or had been sent in by the government.\n\nKabore, first elected in 2015 before winning re-election five years later on campaign vows he would prioritise the fight against the jihadist insurgency, has faced rising public anger about the failure to stop the bloodshed.\n\nA group of protesters supporting the soldiers set up makeshift roadblocks on several main streets in the capital before being dispersed by police, AFP journalists said.\n\nThere have been several coups or attempted coups in Burkina Faso. In neighbouring Mali \u2014 where the insurgency began before crossing the border \u2014 the military toppled the civilian government in 2020.\n\n\u2013 Soldier demands \u2013\n\nThe latest volatility in Burkina Faso began on Sunday morning when gunfire was heard at numerous military bases, including two in Ouagadougou.\n\nThe rebellious troops presented a list of demands, which emphasised the need for a better anti-jihadist strategy, but did not mention trying to oust Kabore.\n\n\u201cWe want adequate resources for the battle\u201d against Islamist extremists, a soldier from the Sangoule Lamizana base in Ouagadougou said in a voice recording received by AFP.\n\nThe disaffected soldiers also wanted top generals to be \u201creplaced\u201d, better care for wounded troops and more support for the families of soldiers killed in battle, the spokesman for the mutinous troops added in the anonymous recording.\n\nTalks between representatives of the soldiers and Defence Minister General Barthelemy Simpore failed to make headway, a government source said.\n\nOn Saturday before signs of soldier mutinies, police used tear gas to disperse banned protests against the government\u2019s anti-jihadist strategies, arresting dozens.\n\nThen on Sunday, demonstrators set fire to the headquarters of the ruling party.\n\nBefore reports of the president\u2019s arrest, the government had denied an \u201carmy takeover\u201d.\n\nIn response to the unrest, authorities declared an overnight curfew from 8:00 pm (2000 GMT) Sunday \u201cuntil further notice\u201d and the education ministry said schools would be closed Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe Sangoule Lamizana camp where Kabore is being held also houses a military prison where General Gilbert Diendere \u2014 a former right-hand man to deposed president Blaise Compaore \u2014 is serving a 20-year term for an attempted coup in 2015.\n\nDiendere is also on trial for his alleged part in the 1987 assassination of the country\u2019s revolutionary leader, Thomas Sankara, during a putsch that brought Compaore to power.\n\nCompaore, overthrown by a popular uprising in 2014, fled to Ivory Coast, and is being tried in absentia for the assassination.\n\nThe latest turbulence coincides with a jihadist insurgency that swept in from Mali in 2015, overwhelming Burkina\u2019s poorly trained and badly equipped armed forces.\n\nAround 2,000 people have died, according to an AFP tally, while around 1.5 million people are internally displaced, according to the national emergency agency CONASUR.",

          "text": "With 37 days to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a Federal High Court sitting in Port-Harcourt, Rivers state has struck out the suit challenging the legitimacy of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CCEPC).\n\nThe ruling, which is about the third in four months and coming from different courts, came at the height of the multiple crises resulting from power play among various stakeholders within the APC to halt the Buni-led committee ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nDelivering the ruling in the Suit No: FHC/ABJ/857/2021brought before it by Odjebobo Desire Onayefeme and others, Justice Phoebe Msuen Ayua said the APC National Chairman, the National Working Committee of the party as well as the CCEPC National Secretary sued as 2nd, 3rd and 4th defendants respectively were non-juristic persons.\n\nHe therefore struck out all the defendants on that ground.\n\nPrior to this time, a Delta State High Court had, on October 15, 2021, similarly struck out an action filed by Elvis Ayomanor and others, challenging the APC Ward, LGA and State Congresses.\n\nIn the same vein, Justice G.B Briki-Okolosi of the Delta State High Court, on December 22, 2021, struck out Suit No: A/139/ 2021 between Chukwusa Edafe Matthew & 14 others Versus APC & others, seeking to set aside APC Ward, LGA and State Congresses in Delta state.\n\nIn the latest judgement, the Court ruled that the action was \u201cnon-justifiable and incurably incompetent because the substratum of the matter borders on the internal affairs of the All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nThe latest ruling has put to rest the furore surrounding the legality of the Buni-led CCEPC.\n\n\u2018Party not in crisis\u2019\n\nCommenting on the development, an APC chieftain in Kogi state, Kingsley Fanwo, dismissed the crisis tag often attached to the party.\n\nFanwo, who is the state commissioner for information and communications, said the current happening within the party is politics and not unexpected.\n\nThe party chieftain made the clarifications on People, Politics and Power, a political programme on the African Independent Television weekend and monitored in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe party is not in any form of crisis. What we have is an attrition of interests which is normal in a ruling party that many believe will continue to lead Nigeria beyond 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Mai Mala Buni leadership of the party has done very well in stabilizing the party and attracting political heavyweights into the party. PDP is saying there is problem in APC, and their governors, senators and other heavyweights are dumping their party for the ruling APC. Who is in crisis here?\n\n\u201cCrisis ridden parties are not naturally attractive. So, Nigerians know which party is struggling and lamenting. If they think Nigerians have forgotten how they destroyed this country, they will know better in 2023.\u201d\n\nFanwo further lauded the Buni-led committee for ensuring very successful congresses from the ward to the state level, describing the CECPC as trusted to \u201cdeliver a National Convention to remember.\u201d\n\nParty members urge Buhari on chair\n\nMeanwhile, the South-south Emerging Leaders\u2019 Forum (SELF) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to sustain his anti-corruption policy by supporting a corruption-free aspirant among all contenders for the APC national chairmanship.\n\nThe forum said President Buhari\u2019s major legacies after 2023 should include his successor and those that would emerge leaders of the party were not indicted by any anti-corruption agency.\n\nSELF National Coordinator Barrister Preye Wilson said this in a statement Sunday in Abuja.\n\nWilson said his forum had taken it upon itself to help the president identify credible national chairmanship aspirant among the eleven aspirants jostling to lead the ruling party.\n\nHe said a challenge had been thrown to the North to also ensure only a credible and corruption-free presidential aspirant from the South is supported.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cAs a forum we are mindful of what becomes the anti-corruption fight of Buhari\u2019s administration after the President might have left in 2023. We are also mindful of legacies our amiable President will leave behind in terms of a successor and those who lead the ruling party.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that corruption is contagious and it spreads like a virus that must be avoided. Its spread faster than cancer, if a corrupt or any indicted person is allowed to lead the ruling party one wonder how it will be easy to lead anti-corruption campaign henceforth.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that all the contenders are qualified to be APC national chairman in terms of their political experiences but integrity should be the yardstick and not how long one has been in politics or positions such individuals have held in the past.\n\n\u201cWe have, however, painstakingly studied the records of all the prominent eleven aspirants that are jostling for the position of APC national chairman and we can only beat our chests for the Senator representing Niger East at the Red Chamber, Muhammed Sani Musa, aka 313.\n\n\u201cWe therefore challenge other reputable organisations like ours to cross-check this fact and also do their separate due-diligence in terms of corruption records of all those currently seeking endorsement to lead the APC.\u201d",

          "text": "Former Head of State General Abdulsalami(retd) Abubakar has clarified that the controversial winner of June 12, 1993 presidential election, Bashorun Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, was not killed but died after taking ill in detention.\n\nAbiola was incarcerated in government custody by the then head of state, General Sani Abacha for declaring himself as president of Nigeria after the 1993 polls, which he was adjudged to have won.\n\nHe later died in detention in 1998.\n\nSpeaking 24 years after, General Abdulsalami said there was no truth in the insinuations that Abiola allegedly took poisoned tea before he passed on.\n\nThe military leader spoke in an interview with Trust TV monitored by our correspondent.\n\nAsked how it all went, the former Nigerian leader said: \u201cWell, I smile because there were lots of allegations here and there that we killed Abiola. As always, when I am talking about late Abiola, I still thank God for directing me on things to do when He gave me the leadership of this country.\n\n\u201cOn the day Moshood Abiola passed away, may he rest in peace, two to three things make me always say I thank my God for the guidance He gave me. One was I received a delegation from America headed by Pickering who was then, I think, the secretary of state or so. In his team, I remember very well, was Susan Rice. I remember her very well because of the role she played later.\n\n\u201cSo, after the normal courtesy and discussion we had, when they were leaving my office, Pickering said \u201cYour Excellency, we made a request to see Moshood Abiola but we were denied\u201d, so I said \u201cwhy were you denied? who denied you?\u201d There and then, I made a decision, I said \u201cyou will see Moshood definitely; I overruled whoever said you cannot see him\u201d. So I now called my chief security officer, I said \u201cplease make arrangement for this team to see Abiola,\u201d that is one point.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the incarceration of Moshood Abiola, except his personal doctor, to my knowledge, no member of his family saw him. So, when I became head of state, based on consultation and interaction together with Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, I gave the family a date that they could come and see him. So a day before he died, his family came to Abuja to see him.\n\n\u201cFor one reason or the other, the whole family could not see him at the same time, so it was agreed that when this group of his family see him today, tomorrow the next team will see him. So, they saw him like yesterday, now this team from US came to see me and I said they could see him. Normally it was in the evenings the family go and see him. So because I had authorised the American team to see him, the other parts of the family were waiting to see him.\n\n\u201cSo, it was at this meeting when the American team was meeting Abiola, he fell sick and suddenly the security officers called the medical team to come and attend to him, and when they saw the situation they said it was severe and they needed to take him to the medical centre. So it was the medical team plus the American team that took him to the medical centre, unfortunately at the medical centre he gave up.\n\n\u201cThen my security chief called and said \u201cI have bad news for you\u201d, I asked what it was, he said \u201cAbiola is dead\u201d. I was shocked. He told me he was there with the American team, at that time I was staying in the barracks, I had not moved to the Villa. So, I said okay, let him take the American team to my house, I will meet them at the house; so I closed from the office, and went there.\n\n\u201cThe issue now was how do I break the news to Abiola\u2019s family and how do we tell the world Abiola had passed on. I must be thankful to God and again to Ambassador Kingibe because we called on him and asked him to bring the family of Abiola. So when they came, I broke the news, that unfortunately, this is what has happened.\n\n\u201cAs you would expect, the family broke down and they started crying, I can\u2019t remember which of the ladies, I held her, she was crying, sobbing, it was then Susan Rice, that is why I always remember her, said \u201cMr President that is not your job, let me do it\u201d, so she now held this lady until she settled down and she calmed down a little bit. Then we had to summon my second in command and other people and then strategized on how to break the news.\n\n\u201cThat is why I always say I thank my God for guiding me. If I hadn\u2019t said the American team should go and meet Abiola, certainly I don\u2019t know how I would explain to the world that Abiola had died, and the American team will they believe me that we had not killed Abiola at that time when they were requesting to see him?\u201d",

          "text": "Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Idah Peterside, says Nigeria crashed out of the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) as a result of many irregularities.\n\nPeterside, who spoke on Monday during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s breakfast programme Sunrise Daily, listed some of such irregularities to include lack of planning, failure to switch tactics, and unnecessary promises for the players, among others.\n\n\u201cWe should have won that game,\u201d he said in reaction to Nigeria\u2019s defeat to Tunisia on Sunday night at the Stade Roumde Adjia in Garoua, Cameroon. \u201cWe were on the better side. We didn\u2019t do what we should have done at the beginning of the game.\n\n\u201cThey gave us so much rest and we should have utilised that opportunity. The game was a little bit slow. Tunisia players tried to slow it down; they knew we were quicker and better. We should have gotten that first goal and things would have changed.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Crash Out Of 2021 AFCON After Loss To Tunisia\n\n\u201cTactically, they were superior. They knew what they wanted to do. They slowed down the game and frustrated us. They knew our strength was from the left.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Promise\u2019\n\nThe Television pundit said the Eagles coach, Augustine Eguavoen, also should have changed tactics at a point in the match and the assistant coach could have helped out, even if the coach didn\u2019t see that.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cThis is where the assistant comes in. When you watch the English Premier League, you will see the assistant coach once in a while come to whisper something to the coach. We didn\u2019t see that happen too many times yesterday. You need to change tactics,\u201d Peterside added.\n\nHe said the mind of the players should have been focused on the match, but they were probably distracted by some officials who went to the dressing room to promise them cash rewards.\n\n\u201cIn our mind, we all felt this was a foregone conclusion. We were already calling ourselves champions when we had not qualified. News filtered that some officials \u2013 not football coaches \u2013 were going to the dressing room to address the players.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a psychology of football. A footballer has to think about the match 100%. This is football, don\u2019t promise them,\u201d Peterside stated.\n\nTunisia shocked the Super Eagles to set up an AFCON last-eight showdown after Youssef Msakni scored two minutes into the second half to give the previously unimpressive North Africans a second-round triumph over 10-man Nigeria.\n\nNigerians\u2019 hopes of equalising were dealt a huge blow midway through the second half when Alex Iwobi, initially yellow-carded for a stamp on Msakni, was sent off after the referee checked the VAR monitor.",
