According to information, the school is owned by Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Dominion Sanctuary, Acme Road, Ikeja.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo, who confirmed the development, announced this, saying, the closure became necessary to pave the way for more discreet and proper administrative investigations into the school\u2019s operations, procedures as well as the conduct of its officials during and after learning hours.\n\nAccording to Adefisayo, the investigations would also ascertain how the Redeemers had conducted its operations in accordance with the schools\u2019 safety standards and guidelines set for education institutions across Lagos.\n\nShe expressed government\u2019s concerned about the safety of all students across the state.\n\nAdefisayo, in a statement, stated that investigation by the Office of Education Quality Assurance of the Ministry revealed that the Redeemers school was yet to conclude its registration \u201cand is, therefore, not yet an approved school.\u201d\n\nAdefisayo said that the school would remain closed, pending an administrative investigation of its operations and procedures as well as the conduct of its officials \u2013 in line with schools\u2019 safety standards and guidelines.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe investigation is a sequel to the death of a five-year-old pupil, who is suspected to have drowned during a swimming lesson while in the custody of the school. The police are investigating the matter.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry is concerned about the safety of the pupils, hence the need for intervention. The school will remain closed until all the required approval processes are concluded. Parents are advised to note the closure and wait for the conclusion of the administrative investigation\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the father of the deceased boy, Anthony Eze, narrated that the young Chidera reportedly drowned at the swimming pool of Ivory Health and Wellness Club, located on Ogundana Street, off Allen Avenue, Ikeja.\n\nIt was gathered that the apparently shocked and confused father had dropped his child in school on Monday, May 16, 2022, only for him to be called hours later to come and pick his son\u2019s lifeless body.\n\nEze however, blamed the school caregivers for negligence of duties which he believed led to his son\u2019s death as his corpse was allegedly left in the pool for more than 30 minutes before it was discovered and removed subsequently.\n\nWhile grieving over death, Eze also, accused the school management of cover-up attempt.\n\nHow I received the sad news, father narrates\n\n\u201cI dropped my children: Chidera Andre Eze and his younger brother, at their school, Redeemers Nursery and Primary School Dominion Sanctuary ACME Road, \u1eccgba, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cAt about 10:52 I received a call from the Head Teacher, Mrs. Adeola Oladipo, that my son Chidera had an accident and was rushed to Ikeja Medical Center Off Allen Avenue. I got to the hospital only to meet my son\u2019s lifeless body.\n\n\u201cI asked what happened but no one was forthcoming. The doctor said he was brought in dead. I was confused; I called my sister later joined me.\n\n\u201cWe were still trying to figure out what happened amid tears and wailing when my wife arrived. I was later told that the same Head Teacher called her. It was a beehive of confusion,\u201d Eze narrated.",

          "text": "By Steve Oko\n\nTen days after defecting from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to Young Progressives Party, YPP, the Chairman of Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State, Hon. Ibe Nwoke, was Monday, replaced by his Deputy, Mrs Uloma Nwogu.\n\nMrs Nwogu was sworn in by Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu at the Executive Council chamber of Government House Umuahia.\n\nObingwa LGA is Gov. Ikpeazu\u2019s home LGA, and political watchers see the Council boss\u2019 defection to YPP as a blow too hot for the Governor to absorb.\n\nNwoke is also the candidate of YPP for Obingwa/Osisioma/Ugwunagbo federal consituency seat.\n\nThe two-year tenure of the replaced Chairman, Nwoke will be due in December 2022.\n\nSpeaking after swearing in the new Council Chairman, Ikpeazu who just returned from a vacation in Turkey with Gov. Nyesom Wike, said he was in receipt of a letter dated May 23, 2022, written by Hon. Nwoke where he resigned his membership of the PDP.\n\nThe Governor, therefore, explained that his replacement was in tandem with the Laws guiding the Abia State Local Government system.\n\nIkpeazu accused the replaced Council boss of breaching the provisions of Section 23, Sub-section 1(f) of the Abia State local Government Law No. 2 of 2006.\n\nAccording to the Governor, such a breach of the law will not go without consequences.\n\nHe said the law made it imperative for a new Chairman to be sworn in to take over the reigns of power at the Obingwa Local Government.\n\nAccording to him, the event marked a milestone in the development of the Local Government system, noting that his administration is the only one that deemed it wise to conduct council elections for two consecutive times within his tenure.\n\nMeanwhile, Gov.

          "text": "The Federal Government has reiterated its resolve to check the increase in incidents of vesicovaginal fistula among Nigerian women and proffer ways to alleviate the pains of sufferers.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire gave the assurance in Abuja, during the rollout of a \u2018Rehabilitation and Reintegration Project for women and girls themed: \u2018Momentum Safe Surgery in Family Planning and Obstetrics 2022\u2019.\n\nObstetric Fistula, a prevalent public health challenge occurs when a woman suffers trauma to the vagina, leading to rupture or tear and is unable to control her urine and subsequently suffers incontinence.\n\nThe healthcare challenge, which is often seen in underage mothers poses devastating maternal and child morbidities.\n\nIt is estimated that over 13,000 new cases occur annually among young girls and women, raising the urgent need to end the menace, the Minister of Health said.\n\nEmphasising the need for adequate care for victims of fistula, stakeholders said all hope is not lost for women suffering from this medical disorder as there are opportunities for repair, rehabilitation and reintegration.\n\nThe Minister who was represented by the Director and Head of the Family Health Department, Dr. Salma Ibrahim expressed grave concern over the plight of affected women.\n\nHe frowned at the activities of quack doctors leading to the surge of the Fistula crisis in the country.\n\n\u201cSometimes, what we call the hydrogen fistula, happens during a cesarian section where medical doctors that are unqualified, some are even quack doctors, attempt to do cesarian section they end up creating a hole in the bladder and leads to leakage of urine or leakage of stool on the rectum.\n\n\u201cSo this is far devastating to women and girls because you can imagine smelling urine and stool. So the first devastating thing is that they are abandoned by their partners or by their husbands.\n\n\u201cThey are also abandoned by their immediate family members and most of these women are young girls and uneducated, they are not empowered because they are not working. They don\u2019t have any source of income.\n\n\u201cWhat we aim to do is to work together with all our partners to ensure zero tolerance to Fistula in Nigeria.\n\nMedical Coordinator, TEEN Ambassadors Foundation, Samuel Munza, observed that \u201csome girls get married too early, 12, 13 years, we even have issues of nine years old getting married.\n\n\u201dEarlier you heard the opening address by the representative of the Minister for Health, where she mentioned the story of the 16-year-old woman who got married between the age of 9 to 13, and then the first time she had sexual intercourse was when she took in and ended up with fistula.\n\n\u201cThat means she has lived up to 50 years with that fistula. Of course, what happened was that she was thrown on the street of Kano and at the end of the day, she couldn\u2019t seek help, imagine how long, this period of 50 years plus and she is only getting to find help just recently. So the problem is quite enormous,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile pledging the Foundation\u2019s resolve to help alleviate the suffering of the victims of Fistula, Munza said, \u201cOur role here as TEEN Ambassador Foundation is that of providing educational services because we provide prevention services through educating the masses and as we told you, the teenage population is very important here, not just the teenage population but the women and girls generally.\n\nIn his remarks, Professor James Ayangunna from the University of Ibadan stressed the need for adequate provision for the rehabilitation and reintegration of the affected women into society after their surgeries.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe want to look at it from another perspective not necessarily from the surgery side. When doctors have done their own work, the surgeons, they\u2019ve corrected it, they\u2019ve done it, there must be ways of rehabilitating these women and there must be ways of integrating them back into society. So that is what we are here for.\n\n\u201cWe know the doctors would have done a good job, they\u2019ve corrected the fistula case but the woman would have to go back into the society, the society that has rejected her. How do we now do it?\n\n\u201cFirst, you rehabilitate and the second aspect is the reintegrating\u2019 you reintegrate the women back to the society for proper social functioning so that they will be able to continue with their lives, that\u2019s why we are here,\u201d Professor Ayangunna said.",

          "text": "The National Industrial Court of Nigeria, Port Harcourt Division has held that the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners in Nigeria (RPC) 2007, regulates individual lawyer\u2019s conduct, not the law firm.\n\nJustice Nelson Ogbuanya held that by virtue of the combined effect of Sections 2(1) and 24 of the Legal Practitioners Act, a law firm not being a legal practitioner, cannot come within the purview of the RPC for the purposes of regulating lawyer\u2019s conduct in legal practice.\n\nThe judge gave the ruling on June 15, 2022 in Suit NICN /PHC/120/2021, (Mr. Wilson Udo Essien v. Unitech Drilling Company Ltd).\n\nHe handed down the decision while delivering ruling on Preliminary Objection filed by Wilcox Abereton SAN.\n\nAbereton was challenging appearance of lawyers from the Zenith Law Firm, on the ground that the firm\u2019s lawyers could not be allowed to appear in court to represent the firm whereas the two partners in the firm, (Christopher and Bassey), were salaried directors of the Defendant Company sued by its erstwhile Managing Director.\n\nHe anchored his objection on Rule 8 of the RPC, which restricts appearance of lawyers in salaried employment and company directors on behalf of their employer/company.\n\nAbereton argued that even if the affected partners do not physically appear as counsel in court or sign the court processes, the entire lawyers are affected as the law firm has been tainted by breach of the rules by the partners of the law firm who have been confirmed to be salaried directors of the Defendant Company.\n\nHe further submitted that since the Directors are the same persons running the law firm, \u201cwhatever taints them by the RPC applies to their law firm, including whoever they would appoint to represent them in court for the company where they are paid Directors\u201d.\n\nOpposing him, Defence counsel G.Agi, Esq, contended that the provisions of Rule 8 of the RPC was not breached, as long as the said partners of the law firm, who were salaried directors of the Defendant company, neither franked the court processes filed in court nor appeared physically in court for the Defendant company.\n\nAnd as such, the lawyers who filed the defence processes and appeared in court from the law firm should not be prevented from carrying out their legal practice in the law firm.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Ogbuanya, while agreeing that both partners of the law firm could not appear in court or frank court processes, rather held that the act of the law firm\u2019s partners being salaried directors would not prevent the other lawyers in their law firm from plying their trade and representing the Defendant company in court.\n\nDismissing the objection, the court held that: \u201cAlthough individual legal practitioners can aggregate as a law firm, yet they are imbued with individual responsibility under the RPC, which is never collective within the legal regime of law practice in Nigeria. I so hold.",

          "text": "The Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has dropped a charge of defilement filed against a former driver of Beehive Nursery and Primary School, Agidingbi in Ikeja, Lagos, Kingsley Okwumbu.\n\nThe DPP dropped the charge, which was before Magistrate Ejiro Kubeinje of an Ikeja Magistrates\u2019 Court, due to insufficient evidence.\n\nOkwumbu, 37, was accused by the police of defiling a three-year-old pupil of the school.\n\nBut the June 7 legal advice signed by the DPP, Dr. Babajide Martins, with reference number LIP/MISC/2022/76/12, stated that there were insufficient facts to establish a prima facie case against Okwumbu.\n\nIt was issued in response to a June 4 letter from the Divisional Police Headquarters, Isokoko Division, Agege, Lagos, with reference number CR:3100/LS/ISK/VOL.TI/22.\n\nAccording to the case, said the DPP, Okwumbu was no longer the driver of the school bus as of March 23, when the alleged incident occurred, having been relieved of his job as of March 14, for non- maintenance of the bus.\n\nThe DPP report stated in part: \u201cThis office is of the view that there are insufficient facts to establish a prima facie offence of defilement of a child contrary to Section 37 of the Criminal Laws State, 2015 against Kingsley Okwumbu.\n\n\u201cFacts reveal that PageB1 (Okwumbu) was no longer the driver of the school bus as of March 23, when the alleged incident occurred as PageB1 had been relieved of the duty of driving the school bus on March 14, for non-maintenance of the bus.\n\n\u201cThe statement of PageB3 \u2013 Osem Aba Matthew (a new driver) who took over from PageB1 also revealed that each day pupils are picked from their respective houses.\n\n\u201cThere is an entry book and same is completed by bus attendant when pupils are returned. There was never a time when the bus driver was alone with any of the pupils in the bus.\n\n\u201cThe above casts a material doubt as to who in fact sexually defiled or molested Page A5 (the child).\n\n\u201cThe law is settled that where there is material doubt as to whether the defendant commits the alleged offence, such doubt shall be resolved in favour of the defendant\u201d.\n\nIt was noted that the child\u2019s mother suspected defilement when the child would cry whenever she washed her private parts. On enquiry, the child allegedly said it was Okwumbu that touched her \u201cwee wee and bum bum\u201d.\n\nThe medical report indicated blunt force penetration of the child\u2019s genital\u201d.\n\nBut, following Okwumbu\u2019s denial of the allegation and the lack of other facts against him, the charge was dropped.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, a person cannot be convicted of rape of a girl under 14-years of age upon the uncorroborated testimony of one witness,\u201d the DPP explained, adding that this was in accordance with Section 179 (5) of the Evidence Act, Cap.112 of the Laws of the Federation, 1990 and Section 218 of the Criminal Code Act, Cap. 77 of the Laws of the Federation, 1990.\n\nMagistrate Kubeinje had on April 19 remanded Okwumbu at the Kirikiri Correctional Centre after directing the police to send the case file to the Lagos DPP for legal advice.",

The National Working Committee (NWC) is divided now.\n\n\u201cSome governors, ex-governors, ex-ministers and founding fathers of the party like a former National Security Adviser Gen. Aliyu Gusau, ex-President of the Senate Bukola Saraki, Governors Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Douye Diri and Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, ex-Governors Henry Seriake Dickson, Sule Lamido, Babangida Aliyu, Boni Haruna and others are with Atiku.\n\n\u201cBut from Wike\u2019s camp, a new set of power brokers is emerging.

Wike is a committed and loyal party leader. He has been there for PDP when some leaders abandoned it.\n\n\u201cWike was recommended by a committee as vice presidential candidate of the party, but some forces in the party abandoned the report without mutual consultations.\n\n\u201cThey came up with ridiculous excuses of temperament, ambition and overzealousness. When it comes to certain challenges, Wike is useful.\n\n\u201cYet, it has pleased some leaders of the party to wish him away as nobody. They came up with ridiculous excuses.\n\n\u201cAlso, what is hurting the Rivers State governor and his strategists is that all mutual decisions agreed with Atiku were not honoured, including the one at their meeting after the presidential primaries. Atiku paid a visit to Wike in Abuja and some issues came up.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that happened in the party was that the likes of ex-Governor Babangida Aliyu started attacking Wike. The hand was Esau\u2019s, the voice was Jacob\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cWike is ready to draw the battle lines any moment from now because Atiku\u2019s camp has not been forthcoming, especially on a minimum demand.\n\n\u201cIt was agreed that once a presidential candidate comes from the North, the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, will step down.\n\n\u201cIf PDP leaders cannot comply with a minimum threshold, you can imagine what will happen after the party wins the 2023 poll.\u201d\n\nA source in Atiku\u2019s camp said: \u201cIt is strategically unwise to ask Ayu to step down because Atiku is yet to win the election.

          "title": "VP slot: Islamic cleric, MBF, Afenifere, others reject Muslim-Muslim ticket",
          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nProminent Nigerians, including frontline Islamic cleric have cautioned against same religion presidential ticket, saying it would exacerbate the religious tension in the country.\n\nSince Bola Tinubu emerged the presidential candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC), there have been arguments and counter-arguments as to whether he would pick a Muslim or a Christian as running mate.\n\nKaduna-based Islamic cleric, Sheik Haliru Maraya, said it was wrong for any Muslim to support a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe former special adviser to the late Kaduna State Governor, Ibrahim Yakowa on Islamic Matters and Hajj, said a one faith joint ticket was at variance with the spirit of justice entrenched in Islam.\n\nThe cleric, in a statement, yesterday, said those promoting the Muslim-Muslim ticket do not wish the country well.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a Muslim who will support a Christian-Christian presidential ticket. Undoubtedly, the Muslims would cry out for the perpetration of injustice against them. Hence, it is wrong for a Muslim to support a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as it is at variance with the spirit of justice which the religion of Islam promotes and defends at all times.\n\n\u201cThose promoting the idea of a Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian presidential ticket, in today\u2019s Nigeria, do not wish the country well, especially now that it is divided along religious fault lines. I wonder what the country would be should the various agitations in the land assume\n\n\u201cFor a political party to have Muslims as its national chairman, presidential candidate and vice-presidential candidate, such a party is indeed not in a position to say it promotes and defends the spirit of justice, fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a multi-religious country of more than 200 million people who are Muslims and non-Muslims. Hence, one can say that the country is owned by more than 200 million citizens who are of diverse religious background. In order to be just to all the citizens of the country, and also to balance the apparent religious sentiments prevalent in the country, Nigeria\u2019s politicians and its major political parties have avoided fielding same-faith presidential candidates since the present political dispensation from 1999.\n\n\u201cIn any event, the combination of people of different religious background, on a presidential ticket, appears to give vent to the constitutional requirement that the composition of the Federal Government and its agencies should reflect the federal character of the country, and the need to promote national unity, thereby ensuring that there is no predominance of sectional groups in the government, as enshrined in Section 14(3) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended.\u201d\n\nMaraya said the combination of a Muslim and non-Muslim, in a presidential ticket, in Nigeria of today, also gives vent to the spirit of justice, fairness and equity as enshrined in the religion of Islam.\n\nIn its reaction, the Nigeria Democracy Defence Watch, also warned that a Muslim/Muslim ticket would adversely affect its fortune.\n\nIts National Coordinator and National Secretary, Ahmed Adamu and Adeniji Adegoke, in a letter addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the plan would portray Nigeria as an Islamic and sectarian nation.\n\nThe group said millions of Christians, moderate and progressive Muslims, civic groups, ethno-cultural associations and enlightened members of the international community, would rise against the ticket.\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said anybody contemplating that alternative was not thinking about the sensitivity of Nigerians and the situation at hand. He noted that Nigeria is currently polarised so much that such a move is capable of inflaming the country beyond anybody\u2019s control.\n\nThough President of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima, agreed that Muslim-Muslim ticket is not ideal, he said it was inevitable for the APC under the current circumstance.\n\n\u201cAs it is today, considering the numerical strength of Muslim North, it will amount to a big risk and gamble for Tinubu to pick a non-Muslim from the North as his running mate. It is not because it is what I want but nobody can afford to gamble with a non-Muslim and expect a typical Northern Muslim to support that. It will be difficult, not because some of us want it that way, but that is the reality. I am sure if the APC had their way, they could have put a Christian from the North but considering the fact that there is mutual suspicion between Muslims and Christians in the North, it will be difficult for that to happen.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that APC has no choice, even as he noted that the journey with be rough with such arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe journey will still be rough for Muslim-Muslim ticket but it is a lesser risk for the party. So, I am sure they took the lesser risk above the major risk. An average Muslim in the North does not see Tinubu as his candidate; that is the sentiment.\n\n\u201cTinubu knows the game and the Muslims in the North also know the game and understand the consequences and that is why they are picking Muslim-Muslim. It is unfortunate because ordinarily, we would want to see a situation where we can all be equal in this project; a situation where it does not matter your religion as long as you can give us the result. That\u2019s my personal opinion but the reality on ground is different,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON) and chieftain of the ruling party, Osita Okechukwu, there is nothing wrong in the arrangement.\n\nHe said it would not be politically wise for the APC to go with a Northern Christian, who is a minority in the North, since Tinubu is a also minority in the South by the virtue of his faith as a Muslim in the South.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge difference between when a Northern Muslim runs a Southern Muslim presidential ticket, and when a Southern Muslim runs a Northern Muslim presidential ticket. A Southern Muslim is a minority in the South, therefore, may be compelled to choose a Northern Muslim who belongs to the majority in the North. Bear in mind that we are talking of real politicking, where victory is determined by numbers.\u201d\n\nBut for a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Adetokunbo Pearse and the National Publicity Secretary of pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, it would be the height of insensitivity for the APC to run with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nPearse noted that the APC would be sending a clear message to Nigerians that it does not care about the unity of the country if it goes ahead with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cThe APC will be telling Nigerians that their purpose is to win for the sake of winning, not for the sake of bringing unity or peace, if they go with a Muslim vice presidential candidate. A Muslim-Muslim ticket will further reduce the electability of Tinubu whose chances are quite narrow even now. Keeping in mind that the Vice President is selected and not elected, a Muslim- Muslim ticket, or a South-South ticket will represent a clear demonstration of insensitivity and political recklessness,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Ajayi said religion is not a measure of performance, he noted that agitation for religious balance has become a big issue in Nigeria\u2019s politics due to lack of equity, fairness and justice in the way the country is being governed.\n\n\u201cThe issue of religion, like the issue of ethnicity, becomes topical in Nigeria today because those governing the country, especially in the recent time, have shown deleterious and unbiased bias against those who are not of their faith or the same ethnic group like them. Because of the polarisation in the country today, the ideal thing is to have people of the two faiths combining \u2013 Muslim/Christian or Christian/Muslim. What I think we should stress more is good governance; the type that would ensure that equity, fairness and justice are the operational norms,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nOndo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has said that members of the South West security outfit, Amotekun, would no longer wait for herdsmen and bandits terrorising the state to attack the people, but take the battle to them in the forest.\n\nHe also noted that since the criminals acquired prohibited and sophisticated arms to carry out their nefarious activities without check, the governors may be compelled to acquire their own weapons to confront them headlong.\n\nSpeaking during the Politics Today programme on Channels Television, yesterday, Akeredolu decried a situation where criminals are left to acquire illegal weapons, while Nigerians are disposed of their legally acquired weapons. \u201cWe cannot continue like this any longer. The governors will adopt their own ways to get arms to defend their people,\u201d he added.\n\nHe equally said that if the worsening security situation is to be controlled, Nigeria must begin to seriously consider the issue of state police, because that is the only way out of this insecurity mess in Nigeria: \u201cWe know the limitations of our security agencies, which is caused by our perverted federalism. We cannot secure Nigeria with a central police command. We need to have state police. A situation where one command sits in Abuja to give orders to the rest of the country is no longer factional now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor also charged the people of Ondo State to, henceforth, confront the criminals when they attack them, instead of running into their homes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t run away from them. We must be prepared to confront the challenge. Our people cannot afford to lay back as if we are lazy. We are not lazy; we are indomitable. How we are going to confront the criminals is not what we shall discuss in public, but how we are going to do it is nobody\u2019s business,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the lessons learnt from the Owo Catholic Church attack, he said: \u201cWe should be more careful and very alert at all times to identify strangers in our midst at all times. And when incidents like that happen, we should not run into our houses, but confront it, and that way, the attackers will not be able to escape.\u201d\n\nIF YOU ARE CONFRONTED BY A LION, WH...

The man said they only recovered their vehicle and a handset which they handed over the DSS for analysis and further investigation.\n\nHe also disagreed with the Federal Government\u2019s position that Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) was responsible for the attack, saying the government was too quick to make such a claim. He noted that ISWAP always takes responsibility when they carry out an attack and up till now it has not taken responsibility. How do we determine those behind the attack when herdsmen, bandits and terrorists are all in the bushes.\n\nHe said the government, as a matter of urgency, should strengthen the police and other sister agencies.",

          "text": "As a prominent president of an African nation once explained to then US President Barack Obama, there are lines that Africans should never cross regardless of what the international community thinks. One of such lines is sexuality. While the rest of the world considers the pairing of a man and a woman to be conventional and can be flipped in the name of homosexuality, most of us are not having it. Even so, not everybody has been brave enough, like that African President, to speak out against the rising tide of this behaviour. But the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Segun Runsewe, is leading the conversation.\n\nNot long ago, there was a viral video that almost turned social media on its head: the video of Bobrisky (real name Idris Okeneye) in his female fa\u00e7ade during his alleged housewarming ceremony. In the beginning, Bobrisky received knocks because he claimed that he bought the house for N400 million.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Bobrisky was not the main attraction, rather the Islamic clerics who attended the housewarming ceremony took the spotlight.\n\nThe clerics were not at Bobrisky\u2019s party to renounce his cross-dressing lifestyle. They were there to pray for him, which is the norm on this side of the world whenever one accomplishes something worthwhile. Even though Bobrisky was dressed, spoke, and acted as a female, the clerics had nothing to say except to smile and bob their heads in the face of his aberrant behaviour.\n\nWhat Runsewe predicted not long ago is gradually taking root. According to him, if the Nigerian government does not take a firm stand on the matter of homosexuality and its associated lifestyles (including cross-dressing), it is only a matter of time before it becomes accepted. And if clerics can ignore it, who will have the courage to fight against it?\n\nAnd so Runsewe is vindicated. His vision, needless to say, is on point, as is his counsel on the matter.",

There are even additional challenges today \u2013 economic challenges, especially with the Russian-Ukraine crisis, and economic problems. Other issues are the coups that have taken place in the region in the past couple of years and we are still trying to resolve some of those issues.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that the new leadership under President Sissoco Embal\u00f3 must step up efforts and address those very many responsibilities that the region faces today.\n\nOsinbajo however added that besides the challenges, the region is witnessing appreciable progress in the ECOWAS common currency policy, saying there are things \u201cwe should be happy about\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that there is progress being made on the Lagos-Abidjan Corridor, pertaining to some of the issues around the movement of goods and services on that corridor.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the very important decisions that were taken and I think progress is being made,\u201d the vice-president submitted.\n\nEarlier in his address at the opening session of the summit chaired by President Akufo-Addo, Osinbajo said the efforts and commitment of Nigeria under President Muhammadu Buhari in containing the COVID-19 pandemic and in addressing other challenges across the region were appreciated by the Authority of the Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS.\n\nAcknowledging Nigeria\u2019s contributions, President Akufo-Addo said: \u201cLet me address on behalf of all of us, our thanks to our esteemed colleague, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who in his capacity as champion in the coordination of the fight against the COVID-19, has spared no effort in this endeavour.\u201d\n\nPresident Akufo-Addo then recognized Nigeria\u2019s leadership role in addressing other challenges across the region, especially the menace of coups, terrorism and deteriorating humanitarian situations.\n\nHe said: \u201cIndeed, following the failed coup d\u2019etat of 1st February 2022 in Guinea Bissau and our emergency summit of 3rd February 2022, we decided to deploy an ECOWAS Standby Force to support the stability of the country and President Sissoco Embalo\u2019s elected government.\n\n\u201cThat deployment of 609 security personnel, composed of 150 Nigerian troops and 140 Nigerian police personnel, 150 Senegalese troops, 100 Ghanaian troops and 59 troops from Cote d\u2019Ivoire, with a force headquarters of 80 officers drawn from across the region, under the overall command of a Nigerian general and force commander has now been completed.\u201d\n\nWhile condemning the menace of terrorism in parts of the region, the Ghanaian President said: \u201cThese terrorist attacks are now not only focusing on the Sahel, but also expanding to the coastal states in our region.\u201d\n\nHe also affirmed that ECOWAS remains committed to the restoration of democratic order in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nAmong decisions reached at the end of the meeting was the lifting of financial and economic sanctions against Mali with the expectations for improved progress in the country\u2019s transition to democratic rule.\n\nA newly composed ECOWAS Commission is also in place with the emergence of Gambia\u2019s Omar Alieu Touray, who was introduced Monday to the meeting of The Authority of Heads of State & Government of ECOWAS.\n\nHe replaced Mr. Jean-Claude Kassi Brou of Cote d\u2019Ivoire.",

          "text": "Some personnel of the Nigerian Army have again threatened to stage a protest against what they described as ill-treatment, negligence of their welfare and terrible working conditions as families of their fallen colleagues have been allegedly forgotten by the military and the Nigerian authorities.\n\nThis is coming barely 48 hours to this year\u2019s July 6th Army Day Celebration, in which the aggrieved soldiers have insisted that there is nothing to celebrate.\n\nSome of the soldiers who spoke with SaharaReporters on the condition of anonymity said that there was no need holding a luxurious celebration while officers are dying and family members of their colleagues killed while fighting terrorists are languishing in penury.\n\nAccording to them, the major problem is that some of the top Army officers are involved in massive corruption and feeding large on the entitlements of personnel.\n\nOne of the soldiers said, \u201cWe are not happy. Nothing is worth celebrating. I don\u2019t know what they are celebrating when they supposed to use that Army Day Celebration to think about their lives and think about how to make this army a better army, and to think about how to improve the welfare of soldiers and give them what belongs to them. See Also Military EXCLUSIVE: Disquiet In Nigerian Army As Officers, Soldiers Plan One-day Protest Over Poor Equipment, Welfare, Corruption Under General Yahaya\n\n\u201cThe authorities tried to curb this through the IPPIS (Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System) but till today, they (the army officers) know how to block it because they are corrupt from the bottom. Instead of IPPS, POS (Point Of Sale) is what is paying soldiers today.\n\n\u201cThey are celebrating Army Day while some soldiers are using their money to pay for the houses they are living in while they are serving in the army because there is no accommodation in barracks. There is no equipment, no uniform. Soldiers use their money to buy uniforms and they are talking about Army Day celebration. What are we celebrating? We are not celebrating anything. Nobody is happy to celebrate anything.\n\n\u201cA pair of Army uniforms in Nigeria is N30,000 and above. Some people in Maiduguri for the past 6 or 7 years are still in the battlefield but nobody is talking about their rotation. Some of them; their wives have divorced them because they couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. Their children have turned to another thing.\n\n\u201cThose that sustained injuries because of this country are in hospitals using their money to treat themselves. Yet, the army would say that they are taking care of soldiers and the families of soldiers that lost their lives. How many times has the army\u2019s spokesperson, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, come to the bush to ask soldiers what is going on? Or how many times have they gone to barracks to know how soldiers\u2019 wives are faring?\n\n\u201cThey are celebrating Army Day when former Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, took all the money that was made for weapons for this country for his own selfish interests and nothing has been done because they are protecting him. Over 30 soldiers lost their lives a few days ago in Niger State and they are celebrating Army Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to release money for operation allowance. How will the commanding officers feed the soldiers on the battlefield? Where will they get money to feed them? It has been like that since last month up till now and nothing has been paid. We are all tired and we still wonder what they are celebrating,\u201d another officer said.",

          "text": "Some personnel of the Nigerian Army have again threatened to stage a protest against what they described as ill-treatment, negligence of their welfare and terrible working conditions as families of their fallen colleagues have been allegedly forgotten by the military and the Nigerian authorities.\n\nThis is coming barely 48 hours to this year\u2019s July 6th Army Day Celebration, in which the aggrieved soldiers have insisted that there is nothing to celebrate.\n\nSome of the soldiers who spoke with SaharaReporters on the condition of anonymity said that there was no need holding a luxurious celebration while officers are dying and family members of their colleagues killed while fighting terrorists are languishing in penury.\n\nAccording to them, the major problem is that some of the top Army officers are involved in massive corruption and feeding large on the entitlements of personnel.\n\nOne of the soldiers said, \u201cWe are not happy. Nothing is worth celebrating. I don\u2019t know what they are celebrating when they supposed to use that Army Day Celebration to think about their lives and think about how to make this army a better army, and to think about how to improve the welfare of soldiers and give them what belongs to them. See Also Military EXCLUSIVE: Disquiet In Nigerian Army As Officers, Soldiers Plan One-day Protest Over Poor Equipment, Welfare, Corruption Under General Yahaya\n\n\u201cThe authorities tried to curb this through the IPPIS (Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System) but till today, they (the army officers) know how to block it because they are corrupt from the bottom. Instead of IPPS, POS (Point Of Sale) is what is paying soldiers today.\n\n\u201cThey are celebrating Army Day while some soldiers are using their money to pay for the houses they are living in while they are serving in the army because there is no accommodation in barracks. There is no equipment, no uniform. Soldiers use their money to buy uniforms and they are talking about Army Day celebration. What are we celebrating? We are not celebrating anything. Nobody is happy to celebrate anything.\n\n\u201cA pair of Army uniforms in Nigeria is N30,000 and above. Some people in Maiduguri for the past 6 or 7 years are still in the battlefield but nobody is talking about their rotation. Some of them; their wives have divorced them because they couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. Their children have turned to another thing.\n\n\u201cThose that sustained injuries because of this country are in hospitals using their money to treat themselves. Yet, the army would say that they are taking care of soldiers and the families of soldiers that lost their lives. How many times has the army\u2019s spokesperson, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, come to the bush to ask soldiers what is going on? Or how many times have they gone to barracks to know how soldiers\u2019 wives are faring?\n\n\u201cThey are celebrating Army Day when former Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai, took all the money that was made for weapons for this country for his own selfish interests and nothing has been done because they are protecting him. Over 30 soldiers lost their lives a few days ago in Niger State and they are celebrating Army Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to release money for operation allowance. How will the commanding officers feed the soldiers on the battlefield? Where will they get money to feed them? It has been like that since last month up till now and nothing has been paid. We are all tired and we still wonder what they are celebrating,\u201d another officer said.",

As we rushed out to see what was happening, the hoodlums rushed in holding guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cAll of us scampered for safety and in the process; many of us including me were injured as you can see on my face; just below my eyes. They really turned everything upside down. By the time we came out, they had smashed all our cars and the windows of the house.\u201d\n\nAnother lawmaker, Kawuwa Shehu Damina, described the incident as condemnable and suspected to be related to politics.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn a situation like this, violence cannot solve the problem, it will only aggravate it. All that is required is for us to sit down and dialogue in order to have a solution to the problem. It is simply a misunderstanding among members of the House.\u201d\n\nThe security guard of the guest house also told newsmen that the hoodlums attacked the house with different dangerous weapons.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all had to run for our dear lives. That was how they gained entrance into the building and did the damage.\u201d",

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "10 lessons Emeka Ajene learned while building Gozem",
          "text": "This insightful op-ed was contributed to TechCabal by Emeka Ajene. Emeka Ajene co-founded Gozem alongside Raphael Dana in 2018.\n\nAmong the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria, there\u2019s a proverb that says: \u201cWhat was secret is revealed in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThanks to a variety of experiences across African markets over the last decade, I\u2019ve become privy to a number of earned insights regarding innovation-led businesses across the continent.\n\nBuilding a super app for Francophone Africa\n\nIn 2018, I moved to Lom\u00e9, Togo to bring my various experiences to bear in service of a singular opportunity: building a super app for Africa, starting in Francophone Africa.\n\nAfter four years of advancing this vision alongside an exceptional team, I am pleased to share that I have transitioned from day-to-day management & operational role to a strategic advisor role at Gozem.\n\nFrom the earliest days of traversing the streets of Lom\u00e9 in search of informal sector motorcycle taxi drivers amenable to a quick sales pitch, to our series A fundraise and our recently announced partnership with the International Finance Corporation, to bringing to market what\u2019s now truly Africa\u2019s super app \u2013 one which operates a variety of verticals across Togo, Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon, generates multi-million USD GMV, employs hundreds of team members across West & Central Africa, and positively affects the lives of many thousands of drivers, vendors, & other partners on a daily basis \u2014 the journey has certainly been personally and professionally fulfilling.\n\nSo rather than recount past successes or detail the varied contributions of Raph, Greg, Jean-Martial, Gr\u00e2ce, C\u00e9cilia, Lionel, Manfreed, Pierrick, and many others over the years, here are some useful lessons, peppered with Igbo proverbs, I learned along the way.\n\n\u201cProverbs are the oil with which words are eaten.\u201d \u2013 Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart (1994)\n\nGozem Team. Image source: Emeka Ajene\n\n1. Culture is a function of leadership\n\n\u201cWhen the mother goat chews her cud, her child watches her mouth.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOrganizational culture is a funny thing. Everyone generally agrees upon its importance, at least in theory \u2014 \u2018culture eats strategy for breakfast\u2019 and so on \u2014 but in practice, at the earliest stages of company building, there are many other pressing (and more tangible) issues that steal attention.\n\nAcross African markets where the innovation economy is still nascent and some positive aspects of Silicon Valley-style management aren\u2019t widely-adopted (yet?); it is easy for startups to fall into locally familiar paternalistic, hierarchy-driven cultures where most \u2013 or all \u2013 decision-making comes from authority.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s not uncommon to find that managers are put (or put themselves) on an unwarranted pedestal. (See, for example, the recent conversation around hostile work cultures across the Nigerian tech ecosystem spurred by Damilare\u2019s expos\u00e9 in TechCabal.)\n\nBut often, the highest and best use of authority by company leaders isn\u2019t to simply show power, but to create and empower internal leaders.\n\n2. Talent development is a differentiator\n\n\u201cKnowing but not telling is what kills old men. Hearing but not heeding is what kills young men.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAttracting talent is a challenge for all organizations, and doubly so for early-stage companies. Newer organizations often lack the prestige, ability to pay, and perception of job security (/\u2018deriskification\u2019) that more established businesses enjoy. And for startups operating in African markets, the talent challenge is compounded by the relative lack of depth within local talent pools.\n\nStartups across the African continent must intentionally and aggressively build their talent development muscle. There needs to be a real answer to this question: \u201cHow do we rapidly upskill junior staff and systematically prepare them to grow in the company and take on new challenges?\u201d\n\nOne specific and unorthodox initiative that we undertook at Gozem was to identify promising drivers on the platform and offer them salaried roles within our operational teams. While in some sense this may be cannibalistic as it often takes the best drivers off the roads, these driver ambassadors have a unique understanding of the Gozem platform and are often able to speak and lead certain driver-facing functions in more credible ways.\n\n3. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it, and it\u2019s what gets understood\n\n\u201cThe voice that\u2019s used in quarreling is not the same voice that\u2019s used in making peace.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOftentimes, when I disclose that I moved to Togo to launch Gozem despite not speaking any French, people are shocked. But it\u2019s true, and the experience taught me valuable lessons about communicating effectively.\n\nThere is great difficulty involved in leading a team of people who speak a different language\u2013 a humbling experience to say the least. For me, among other things, it served as a forcing function for trust & deferential leadership \u2013 letting junior team members make contributions in important discussions with external counterparties.\n\nIn Gozem\u2019s early days, after a few miscommunication-linked mishaps, I began sending a daily morning narrative email in French (translated via DeepL) that highlighted priorities of the day and key recent wins & opportunities for improvement.\n\nWhile oral communication certainly has its place, well-thought-out written business communication can improve comprehension, eliminate misunderstandings, and provide organization-wide clarity \u2013 it\u2019s one reason to take Amazon\u2019s business writing culture seriously.\n\nParaphrasing Jeff Bezos, \u201c[written communication] forces better thought and better understanding of what\u2019s more important than what, and how things are related.\u201c\n\n4. When you have leverage, use it\n\n\u201cIf a snake fails to show its venom, children will use it to tie firewood.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nLeverage is a dynamic thing. You have it at one moment under certain conditions, but the next moment, conditions change and you lose it.\n\nIn negotiations, potential \u2018adversaries\u2019 \u2014 employers/employees, founders/investors, business partners, etc \u2014 are often driven primarily by self-interest, so the ability to recognize where the leverage lies at a given point in time can be very valuable.\n\nTo win, one must develop a long-term and non-zero-sum viewpoint. Nonetheless, it\u2019s advisable to exploit identified leverage. While there\u2019ll likely be future consequences if a hand is overplayed, more often than not, unused leverage becomes a source of regret.\n\n5. Systems lead to success\n\n\u201cWhen a group of people expects things to be done by others, nothing is done.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBest-selling author James Clear wrote, \u201cWe don\u2019t rise to the level of our goals; we fall to the level of our systems.\u201d By this, he means that achieving successful outcomes requires consistent faithfulness to enabling processes. And while his book primarily focuses on individuals, I find the same is true for organizations.\n\nIt\u2019s why many of the world\u2019s leading innovation-led organizations use operating/management systems \u2014 the most popular tend to be EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), Scaling Up, and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)\n\nAt Gozem (thanks largely to the influence of Kevin Colas), we began implementing the Scaling Up method two and a half years or so into our journey. Since then, we\u2019ve seen significant gains in terms of accountability, clarity of expectations, and cross-functional visibility.\n\n6. Become a big fish by dominating smaller ponds\n\n\u201cDrop by drop is how the palm wine fills the container.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\n\u201cWould you rather be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?\u201d\n\nFor businesses with venture-scale ambitions, markets matter. So the only answer is to play in a big pond \u2014 one with a clear path to becoming a big fish.\n\nAt Gozem, while we\u2019ve always maintained a big fish-big pond vision since day one, our initial geographic market was Togo, a country with a population of just 8 million, and our initial focus was on the ride-hailing vertical. It\u2019s no surprise that many viewed us quizzically, with many questions about the strategy of playing small initially.\n\nA relevant French expression that I learned during my time in Togo is \u2018Petit \u00e0 petit, l\u2019oiseau fait son nid\u2018 \u2014 little by little the bird builds its nest.\n\n7. Embrace constraints & learn quickly\n\n\u201cHot soup should be sipped carefully.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAccording to Howard Stevenson, an entrepreneurship professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, \u201centrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled.\u201d And, as alluded to in point 6 above, at the early stages of new ventures, it seems there are never enough resources: not enough time, not enough talent, not enough capital, and so on.\n\nConstraints often inspire better thinking, compel creativity, and force focus and (ruthless) prioritization. In many cases, this leads to quick iteration and rapid learning of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and what truly moves the needle. And when a winning formula is found, constraints push you to fully exploit the opportunity and develop a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n\nRead: Marissa Mayer\u2019s \u201cCreativity loves constraints,\u201d \u2014 a book she penned while at Google.\n\n\u201cit is often easier to direct your energy when you start with constrained challenges\u2026or constrained possibilities. \u2026 Limited investment makes it easier to move on to something else that has a better chance of success.\u201d \u2013 Marissa Mayer.\n\n8. Resilience should be a core organizational trait\n\n\u201cA palm nut that wants to become palm oil must pass through fire.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAll businesses have to be resilient of course, but when comparing my experiences in the West to those across sub-Saharan Africa, I\u2019d say that resilience \u2014 the ability to recover quickly from sudden disturbances and adapt easily to misfortune \u2014 is much more necessary in African markets where extraneous shocks are much more common.\n\nDuring my time in Togo, Gozem experienced its share of unforeseen external bad luck, from office flooding to power outages to regular connectivity disruptions and more. Still, the exercise of planning is essential and robust processes to respond to the unplanned are recommended.\n\nWhile I love the Mike Tyson quote, \u201ceveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,\u201d getting punched in the mouth is far from uncommon in a boxing match and one should certainly be prepared to respond.\n\n9. Character, reputation, and integrity are everything\n\n\u201cNot everyone who answers to the title Chief is a legitimate chief.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOne of the most famous scenes in the critically acclaimed TV series The Wire involves ruthless crime lord Marlo Stanfield (played by Jaime Hector) exclaiming, \u201cMy name is my name!\u201d\n\nFor founders and managers of young ventures, your name is your name. Said simply, reputation matters.\n\nAs much as we\u2019d all like the freedom to be individuals, startup leaders (and business leaders in general) represent more than themselves; they represent employees, investors, and other significant stakeholders. How they\u2019re perceived among different groups \u2014 potential customers, partners, investors, etc. \u2014 can often have a real business impact, like it or not. Call it the penalty of leadership in today\u2019s connected age: \u201c[Leaders] must perpetually live in the white light of publicity.\u201d\n\nAnd in low-trust environments such as African markets, my view is that this is doubly important. Both on the individual and institutional levels, it\u2019s important to always act with integrity, deliver on promises, and avoid doubt-inducing controversies.\n\n10. As you build a business, the business builds you\n\n\u201cThe right hand washes the left hand, the left hand washes the right hand.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBuilding a business is a process of discovery. You discover who your customers are and what they need and will pay for. You discover the products and services that best meet those needs. And you discover how to sustainably and profitably meet those needs.\n\nSo there\u2019s customer and market discovery, product discovery, and business model discovery, but one thing not talked about enough is self-discovery \u2014 throughout the entire process one learns and discovers things about her/himself.\n\nIn early-stage ventures, founders and early employees, at the least, tend to be unusually invested in a company\u2019s ups and downs, its peaks and valleys, its daily mishaps and milestones, and they learn things \u2014 about markets, management, and more \u2014 that ultimately shape their worldview. The intensity of the experience often brings with it earned insights that can last well beyond the lifetime of one\u2019s involvement with the business.\n\nHere, I\u2019m reminded of two quotes that I\u2019ll let speak for themselves.\n\nThe American Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, \u201cThe mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\u201d\n\nAnd Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with the quote, \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\u2019s not the same river and he\u2019s not the same man.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd) started its weekly activities with a resolve to quickly end the incessant queues at various filling stations in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nBy this resolution, the company in collaboration with the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) stepped up the supply of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) to the FCT from 70 to 140 trucks to combat the lingering fuel queues.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen during an inspection tour of filling stations in Abuja, NNPC\u2019s Group Executive Director, Downstream, Mr Yemi Adetunji, explained that there were enough petrol in the nation\u2019s strategic reserve to last 32 days.\n\n\u201cWe have 1.9billion litres of PMS that can last for 32 day. NNPC is making every effort to ensure energy security for the country.\n\n\u201cWe have sorted out Lagos. We are working with all relevant stakeholders to bring the situation in Abuja under control; normalcy will be restored in the next few days.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the CEO of the NMDPRA, Mr Farouk Ahmed, said that the improvement in the supply of products from an average of 70 to 140 trucks was made possible by the Presidential approval of a \u20a610 freight rate discount increase to petroleum products transporters as part of solutions to the fuel supply challenge.\n\nHe charged marketers to play by the rules as NMDPRA would not hesitate to sanction anyone found to be involved in underhand practices.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything to bring the situation to normal. We also want to state that there is no increase in the pump price of PMS, and any such sharp practice will be sanctioned accordingly by the Authority,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tour of the filling stations was to monitor developments and ensure compliance.\n\nNMDPRA and NNPC officials inspecting filling stations in Abuja following incessant scarcity of PMS in the FCT\n\nNMDPRA and NNPC officials inspecting filling stations in Abuja following incessant scarcity of PMS in the FCT\n\nIn another development, Major stakeholders in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry have suggested ways to mitigate the continuous rise in prices of diesel and cooking gas in Nigeria.\n\nAmong the stakeholders who spoke at a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Joint Committees on Downstream and Gas Resources in Abuja were the Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, Mr Farouk Ahmed and the Group Managing Director/CEO of NNPC Ltd, Malam Mele Kyari.\n\nLeaders of Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPMAN), Independent Petroleum Marketers Association Of Nigeria (IPMAN), Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Gas Marketers Association, among others, were also in attendance.\n\nFielding questions from members of the committee, Ahmed said that the current geopolitical crisis in Ukraine and Russia had affected the global crude oil supply resulting in the increase of petroleum products prices across the globe.\n\nAhmed said that the rise in the prices of petroleum products was a global phenomenon and not a local problem peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the landing cost of petroleum product was also a major factor affecting the price of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWe need to see what can be done to alleviate the suffering of the people.\n\n\u201cIf our refineries come back on stream and make foreign exchange available at the official rate of N400 per dollar, things will definitely improve.\n\n\u201cWe also need to address the issue of vandalism,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the GMD/CEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, said the only way to tackle the rising price of diesel and cooking gas was to increase the production of crude oil.\n\nNNPC GMD Malam Mele Kyari\n\nNNPC GMD Malam Mele Kyari\n\nKyari said that acts of vandalism of oil facilities have been responsible for the decline in production which in turn was responsible for the unavailability of foreign exchange.\n\nHe disclosed that 27,000 barrels were lost in a recent attack on one of the company\u2019s facilities.\n\nAccording to him, besides the Russia-Ukraine war which is affecting the supply of products across the world, most major oil companies are also shutting down in keeping with global emphasis on the shift from fossil fuels over environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cNo one can guarantee stability of petroleum products supply; the world has never seen this kind of uncertainty. Today, countries are stockpiling products.\n\n\u201cShortly before COVID-19, the world was already facing shortfall of 3 million barrel of supply of oil but with the ongoing intervention, by the end of July we will restore production to a level that is reasonable.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, House Committee on Downstream, Rep. Abdullahi Gaya, said that there was need to find solution to the high cost of diesel and cooking gas in order to alleviate the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nSome of the lawmakers said that although Kyari and Ahmed candidly presented the worrisome situation the industry was faced with, they, nevertheless unanimously expressed confidence in their ability to bring the situation under control.\n\nThe stakeholders present at the hearing include the Independent marketers, suggested a short, medium and long term solutions to combat the challenges.\n\nThey also pledged to work with the NNPC and the regulatory agency to redress the situation.\n\nNMDPRA NNPC Proffer solution to Rise AGO LPG Prices.mp4\n\nMeanwhile, the Management of NNPC Ltd. sensitised members of staff to the challenges and opportunities inherent in the transition from a corporation to a limited liability company.\n\nThis was in continuation of its stakeholders\u2019 engagement to achieve a smooth transition.\n\nThe NNPC GMD/CEO, Kyari, said at a town hall meeting which held at the NNPC Towers, that it was imperative for all staff to embrace the change with courage and look beyond the temporary discomfort to the huge opportunities that lie ahead of the new NNPC.\n\nHe commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the courage to have signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) into law, pointing out that the lack of effective regulatory framework and unbridled government interference were responsible for NNPC\u2019s losses in the past.\n\n\u201cNNPC is now free of burden.\n\n\u201cNigerians are looking up to us, they expect NNPC to lead the way in making profit and adding value for the benefit of the over 200 million stakeholders.\u201d\n\nKyari said that given the volume of the Company\u2019s assets that was signed and transferred officially on July 1, 2022, by the Ministers of Petroleum Resources and Finance respectively, the new NNPC would be the most capitalised company in Africa and would be poised to announce its first Initial Public Offer (IPO) in the next three years.\n\nHe also informed that the company\u2019s financial statement for the year 2021 would be better than that of year 2020 when NNPC reported a profit after tax of 287 billion naira.\n\nIn her remarks, the Chairman of the NNPC Ltd., Sen. Margery Chuba-Okadigbo, assured of the Board\u2019s continuous support towards the realisation of the goals of the new NNPC Ltd., while encouraging members of staff to imbibe the concepts of dynamism and creativity required for global competitiveness.\n\nShe said that deducing from her experience at the helm of the NNPC Board, she had conviction to endorse the GMD\u2019s policies on transparency and accountability, noting that the company as envisioned by the PIA can only achieve its objectives through firm commitment to excellence on the part of the entire workforce.\n\nNNPC Enlightens Staff on significance of Transition\n\nAlso in the week under review, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) concluded the marginal oil fields bid rounds kick-started in the year 2020 with the award of Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPLs) to 161 successful companies.\n\nThe commission also officially unveiled the Host Communities Development Regulations and model PPLs.\n\nSpeaking at the event in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said that the presentation of the Licences was part of the implementation of the PIA 2021.\n\nHe also noted that the category was being handled for the first time.\n\nThe minister who commended the management and staff of the NUPRC for ensuring the successful completion of the process, described the conclusion of the process as a giant milestone for the administration.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the PIA 2021 is in top gear. Consequently, the new awardees should note that their assets will be fully governed by the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\n\u201cAs you develop your assets with the special purpose vehicles (SPVs), ensure that good oilfield practice is employed, environmental considerations and community stakeholders\u2019 management are not neglected.\n\n\u201cIt is my strong belief that the awardees will take advantage of the current attractive oil prices to bring these fields into full production within a short period to increase production, grow reserves and reduce cost of production.\n\n\u201cThe onboarding of new oil and gas players in the petroleum sector is part of this government\u2019s policy to encourage more indigenous participation in our petroleum operations,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nChief Timipre Sylva\n\nChief Timipre Sylva\n\nHe added that the development would boost activities in the oil and gas sector, increase production output and create additional employment opportunities for Nigerians.\n\nOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of NUPRC, Mr Gbenga Komolafe, said that the Marginal Field Bid Round was one of the major tasks inherited by the commission on its inauguration in 2021.\n\nHe listed some of the constraints that caused the delay in the conclusion of the exercise to include, the interruption brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, partial payment of Signature Bonuses by some awardees, and the unwillingness of some co-awardees to work together in forming SPVs for field development.\n\nRecounting the history of the marginal field\u2019s award initiative, Komolafe said that the process which began in 1999 was borne out of the need to entrench the indigenisation policy of the Federal Government in the upstream sector.\n\nHe also said that the aim was to boost local content, stressing that since its inception, a total of 30 fields had been awarded with 17 currently producing.\n\nHe disclosed that the 2020 Marginal Field Bid Round exercise raked in revenue of about 200 million naira and 7 million dollars into the Federal Government coffers.\n\nKomolafe added that the conclusion of the 2020 Marginal Fields Bid Round brought to an end the era of Marginal Field awards as stipulated by the PIA.\n\n\u201cSection 94 (9) of the Act states that no new marginal field shall be declared under this Act.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the minister shall now award PPL on undeveloped fields following an open, fair, transparent, competitive, and non-discriminatory bidding process in line with Sections 73 and 74 of the Act.\u201d\n\nMr Gbenga Komolafe\n\nMr Gbenga Komolafe\n\nHe urged the winner of the marginal fields to take advantage of the current market realities and quickly bring their fields to production, stressing that Nigeria was not benefiting much from the upswing in crude oil prices because of production disruptions occasioned by sabotage, theft, and other operational challenges.\n\nA total of 57 marginal fields were presented in the 2020 bid round out of which 41 were fully paid for and 37 fields were issued with the PPL, having satisfied all conditions for award.\n\nOut of the 665 firms that expressed interest in the exercise, 161 emerged as potential awardees.\n\nSome of the successful companies that received their licences include: Ardova Plc, Matrix Energy Ltd., Sun Trust Oil Company Limited, Deep Offshore Integrated Service Ltd., Island Energy Ltd., Sigmund Oil Field Ltd., and Shafa Exploration and Production Company Ltd., among others.\n\nMarginal Fields NUPRC Awards Licence to 161 Companies\n\nStill in the week, NNPC Ltd. said it was committed to fast-tracking efforts to identify new gas resources and develop existing ones amidst current global yearning for cleaner fuels.\n\nNNPC also said it was making efforts to identify new gas resources to boost revenues for investment in other sectors of the economy as part of its preparation for the global energy transition.\n\nThe NNPC GMD/CEO, Malam Mele Kyari, stated this in a keynote address at the First E&P\u2019s 10th Year Anniversary event which held in Lagos.\n\nThe GMD, who was represented virtually by NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Mr Umar Ajiya, delivered the address with the theme, \u201cScarcity in Abundance: How Gas can Enable Energy Access in Nigeria and Africa\u201d.\n\nHe said that though Nigeria remains determined to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2060, there was absolute need to harness the country\u2019s abundant hydrocarbon resources to actualise that objective.\n\nHe emphasised that with the enactment of the PIA, and the introduction of such initiatives as the Decade of Gas and the Gas Transportation Network Code, Nigeria sought to open up robust and quick business opportunities for both indigenous and foreign investors in the gas sector.\n\n\u201cI make bold to say that harnessing our abundant resources remains Nigeria\u2019s major pathway towards leveraging gas, the least carbon-emitting fossil fuel, as a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cTo this end, massive gas development efforts are ongoing, including the construction of a 614km gas pipeline which is aimed at enabling gas transportation to the North of the country and ultimately beyond Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKyari also congratulated the Board, Management and Staff of First E&P on the 10th anniversary of the company which he described as \u201chistoric milestone\u201d.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nFinancial experts say the increasing inflation rate in Nigeria has impacted negatively on the living standard of Nigerians.\n\nThe experts who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said the rising inflation rate has reduced the purchasing power of individuals leading to a decline in living standards.\n\nAcccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate increased to 17.71 per cent on a year-on-year basis in May 2022.\n\nThe NBS also said that prices of selected food items had increased in the last 12 months in its latest Food Price Watch report in the same period.\n\nProf. Aminu Usman, of the Kaduna State University, said the rising inflation rate meant devaluation of individual income, which amounted to falling purchasing power.\n\nUsman, a lecturer at the Department of Economics, said individuals would now purchase fewer commodities with the same given amount of money.\n\n\u201cThis scenario implies that people\u2019s living condition are deteriorating, especially for low-income groups, whose income is rigidly fixed while prices are skyrocketing.\n\n\u201cIt signifies the descent of many poor to further poverty and worsening conditions of living.\u201d\n\nHe said that a major contributor to the inflationary pressure was food inflation caused by rising food prices, adding \u201cthis is expected because the rains have set in and old stocks are finishing.\n\n\u201cThis is coupled also with the high cost of fertiliser and heightened insecurity which combined to discourage farmers and farming. This has also caused very low projections for agric output,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ben Ekeyi, a Public Financial Management Consultant, said that Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate had a negative impact on the purchasing power of Nigerians in diverse ways.\n\nEkeyi said one of the impacts included reduced ability to purchase needed and required goods and services, especially where there was no corresponding increase in income.\n\n\u201cOthers are a lower standard of living, increased poverty level as Nigerians are increasingly unable to access necessary goods and services.\n\n\u201cIncreased school dropouts, especially at primary and secondary levels. More Nigerian families have become unable to sponsor their wards\u2019 education, thereby, leading to drop out from schools.\u201d\n\nHe said that economists had established a link between lower purchasing power resulting from inflation and an increase in crime rate.\n\nAccording to him, where households are unable to cater for the needs of their members, there is a likelihood that some will go into criminal activities.\n\nEkeyi also said low purchasing power had been linked to increased social vices like prostitution, thuggery, youth restiveness, and suicide rates among others.\n\nHe said that low purchasing power had also increased urban-rural migration, as some Nigerians living in the cities were gradually relocating to their rural communities to due to the high cost of living in the cities.\n\nAccording to him, the low purchasing power also has the potential of leading to death.\n\n\u201cWhen a person is unable to meet basic needs, especially in the area of health care, he is most likely to die,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Paul Alaje, a Senior Economist with SPM Professionals said with the high inflation rate,\n\nit means that someone who had N100,000 this time in 2021, now has less than N85,000 this year for committing no crime.\n\n\u201cIt means that the value of what money can buy has reduced. What is the implication? People will now be able to buy less.\n\n\u201cIf they could buy two bags of rice before with their income, now they can buy less than two bags.\n\n\u201cDoes it mean that hunger in the family has reduced? The answer is No. People are still hungry but their livelihood resources now have weaker purchasing power.\u201d\n\nAlaje said this situation may put several families in jeopardy as some members may lose their jobs because of the failure of their employees to pay them due to a decline in sales.\n\n\u201cSo, when inflation and unemployment set in, you have what we call stagflation, that is a situation where people\u2019s hunger, poverty and deprivation is elevated or increased significantly.\u201d\n\nHe said the general socio-economic implication was an increase in the crime rate.\n\nAlaje said the average inflation rate for a nation should be between three to five per cent but unfortunately, in the last seven years Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate had been in double digits.\n\nA cross-section of Nigerians who spoke to NAN said the increasing inflation rate had reduced their standard of living and made saving impossible.\n\nMr Isaac Ighure, a pensioner said the inflation rate had reduced his standard of living, adding that it was the same situation with many pensioners in the country.\n\nIghure said many families were \u201ccutting corners \u201d in a good way just to be able to eat.\n\n\u201cAmong pensioners and the elderly, inflation is wreaking a lot of havoc, we are barely managing to survive.\n\n\u201cPensioners are on their own, they are suffering, the government does not support pensioners in any way and there is no policy for the elderly in general.\n\n\u201cHow do you pay your children\u2019s fees, pay rent, treat medical issues, etc, as a pensioner? Some pensioners are maintaining their graduate children who do not have jobs.\n\n\u201cYou see many old people dying of hypertension because of all these problems. Their life span could be prolonged if the government can take the responsibility for the health of the elderly,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Tosin Ajayi, a Public Servant and mother of three, said the high cost of living caused by the inflation had become unbearable.\n\n\u201cAs a mother and a public servant, it has not been easy to survive in today\u2019s economy. You will not believe that 90 per cent of the family\u2019s income is used for expenses. You cannot save anymore.\n\n\u201cThe cost of living is high and it is becoming unbearable for everyone. From food items to other consumables, gas, electricity, etc, it is worrisome.\n\n\u201cWhat I do as a mother is to tell my kids the reality on ground. I tell them that it is unacceptable to waste food and to be appreciative of what your parents give you.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the Nigerian government to seek out ways to reduce the inflation rate, 17.7 per cent rate is unacceptable to us. This is crucial to prevent crime rate and illegal activities\u201d, she said.\n\nMrs Lynn Ikechukwu, a housewife and mother of three, said the inflation rate had made it difficult for her to plan and budget for her home.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy to plan and budget with the increasing inflation rate. For instance, between September 2021 and May 2022, the cost of diapers has gone from N6,000 Naira to N7,000, to 7,500 and now N9,500.\n\n\u201cEvery time you go to the market the price of food items keeps increasing, now it is almost impossible to buy tomatoes. You have to forgo some food items. Tell me how someone can plan in such a situation?\u201d\n\nMs Chioma Ibeh, an online food vendor, said the inflation rate had resulted in a decline in customers which had slowed down her business.\n\n\u201cThe prices of food have increased enormously. For almost every food item I buy, the prices have increased to as much as N2,000.\n\n\u201cBefore my 2.4 litres of edikaikong soup used to go for N15,500 and N16,000 but now I sell for N18,000 to N18,500.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell clients the amount for a particular size bowl of soup or stew they complain and say it is too expensive. But at the end of the day that is the reality of the situation in the country.\n\n\u201d I wish the economy can have a balance because inflation is making my business very slow.\n\n\u201cIn a week, I can go without having any food orders and this is bad for people like me that have this business as my only source of income, how do I pay my bills?\u201d\n\nMrs Amaka Eze, a market woman, said the increasing inflation made it impossible for her to make profit from sales, adding that things had never been this bad for her business.\n\n\u201d Since I started this business of selling foodstuff, I have never seen anything like this before. I used to buy a carton of Titus fish for N20,000, now it is between N40,000 to N45,000.\n\n\u201cA carton of Panla used to be N6,000 now it is N12,000. I buy a dustbin basket of tomatoes for N4,000, people are no longer coming to buy food items like before because there is no money.\n\n\u201cIt is so bad that some decent guys even come to my shop to beg for a cup of garri to drink because they have no money to buy food to eat,\u201d she said.\n\nNAN recalls that the World Bank\u2019s latest Global Economic Prospects Report said the damage from COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine had intensified the slowdown in the global economy.\n\nThe report said this had led to a period of weak growth and increased inflation, which had raised the risk of stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and low-income economies alike.

He promised that the Commission will certainly partner in this particularly \u201cimpressive, seminal and laudable project\u201d in the context of the proposed Summit.\n\nMuoka said the EVC of NCC, holds NIPR in high esteem, \u201cwhich is the reason he cherished the visit and asked me to receive you in his stead.

          "title": "PDP Sets Up Panel To Beg Wike",
          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party conflict has been resolved under conditions laid out by Nyesom Wike\u2019s supporters.\n\nIn two separate interviews with The PUNCH on Sunday, the governor\u2019s supporters claimed that Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, still had time to reconsider his choice of Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate.\n\nSenator Walid Jibrin, the chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, announced that the party had formed a nine-member team to implore Wike as the situation surrounding Atiku\u2019s running mate grew more dire.\n\nSo This Happened (104) reviews Buhari\u2019s warning to youths, German nun who helped Nigerians| Punch\n\nNOW\n\nPLAYING\n\nSo This Happened (104) reviews Buhari\u2019s warning to youths, German nun who helped Nigerians| Punch\n\nCertain chieftains of the party, including the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, ex-Plateau State Governor, Jonah Jang and others, had criticised the choice of Okowa as the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate.\n\nThere were reports on Friday that Wike snubbed a former Minister of Police Affairs and ally of Atiku, Adamu Waziri, who attempted to initiate a peace talk with him in Turkey.\n\nThe party, also on Sunday, raised another panel headed by Atiku, to pacify the aggrieved Governor and prevail on him not to leave the party.\n\nThe Chairman, Gokana Local Government Area in Rivers State, Confidence Deko, in an interview with one of our correspondents in Port Harcourt, said Wike did not deserve the treatment he got from Atiku and the PDP.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs far I am concerned, Wike has done so much for the PDP and I don\u2019t think he deserves what the party gave to him. Come to think of it, Atiku Abubakar and the party asked the National Working Committee to find out who becomes the vice-president. A report was submitted and he (Atiku) ignored the report, and then picked Ifeanyi Okowa, the Delta State Governor.\n\n\u201cI am not saying he is not supposed to use somebody, but I am of the view that if he was part of those who asked the NWC to search for who becomes the vice-president to be, and they gave him their recommendation, he would have acted on it.\n\n\u201cBut to me, it looks very odd that after submitting the report to him, he went and announced Okowa. I don\u2019t think that Wike deserves what Atiku has done to him.\u201d\n\nThe council boss disclosed that Wike supporters were waiting for his decision and political direction ahead of the presidential poll.\n\nOn the comments of former Plateau State Governor, Jonah Jang, on the chances of the PDP in 2023 due to the festering crisis and if Okowa should be replaced, Deko said the man was not joking.\n\nHe added, \u201cHe has told you and you have heard the truth from him. If Wike was to be the vice-presidential candidate for Atiku, by now, you know Wike is a very practical person. And he does what his mind ask him to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only option is to remove Okowa from there and announce Wike. In 2019, Wike brought the highest number of votes from South-South.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, some members of the House of Representatives loyal to Wike contended that the PDP was bound to fail with its choice of Okowa as the running mate.\n\nThe PDP lawmakers, in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Sunday, also took a swipe at the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, criticising his role in the crisis that has followed the presidential primary of the opposition party.\n\nWhen asked if the party should substitute Okowa with Wike, a member of the House from Kogi State, Teejay Yusuf, said it was possible if the presidential candidate could see the value the Rivers governor would add to the PDP ticket.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat will be the choice of the candidate. It would be his prerogative to do that. It is not for me to suggest that to him. If he sees that Wike will add more value to the ticket and say \u2018with the way it is, I can manage the ripple effect of taking Okowa out,\u2019 why not, if not?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkowa is a PDP governor but nobody can deny the fact that Wike has the will and the capacity to make this party stand on its feet.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, however, dismissed the possibility of Wike, who he described as \u201ca party man,\u201d dumping the PDP for another party or working with another party or presidential candidate through the backdoor.\n\nBut he cautioned that the governor\u2019s loyalty should not be abused.\n\n\u201cI know that the standard-bearer is a politician of repute and he knows the dynamics, but he is a human being. So, if he made the wrong decision, I believe that, fortunately, the Electoral Act (2022) gives ample time; we have eight months to the general elections. In politics, one day can be a million days. A lot can be done in one day,\u201d Yusuf noted.\n\nThe lawmaker affirmed that the standard-bearer should naturally look for the best way to make the decision while avoiding \u201ca situation that might jeopardise the unity of the party and the collective desire to win the election.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker also condemned Ayu for allegedly taking sides in the crisis, when he should have been neutral as the leader of the party.\n\nYusuf cited the example of how Ayu met with the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, and called him a hero.\n\nTambuwal had stepped down for Atiku at the PDP primary, making it possible for the latter to defeat Wike who came second amid protests against the retention of power in the North when it was expected to rotate to the South.\n\nSpeaking on the calls on Atiku to reconcile with Wike, he said, \u201cThat is a fact and that was what was emphasised by the leaders who spoke of recent, notably Governor Ortom and former governor Jang. I lend my voice to that, that one stoops to conquer. It is the normal thing to be done.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker added, \u201cIf the information is true that a committee was set up \u2013 that you set up; it was your committee \u2013 and they came up with the choice of someone. If you are not taking the person, naturally you should call the person.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, I supported Atiku and I was very happy with the way he ran. And I am aware that immediately after the primary, concerted efforts were made and that was how (Senator) Bukola Saraki became the director-general of the campaign.\n\n\u201cIn this one, offers were made and people pushed for Governor Wike as the vice-presidential candidate of the party. If you have any reason (not to pick Wike), you call him, and it should not be that he would be reminded by people like us before it is done. It is not too late to do the right thing and I am aware that certain efforts are being made already.\u201d\n\nAnother PDP lawmaker from Rivers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also noted that Atiku knew what to do to restore peace in the party.\n\nHe asked, \u201cHas he (Wike) not laboured for the party even when the likes of Atiku ran away (to the All Progressives Congress) and went to support this disaster (the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, retd.) that we have on our hands. Was he (Wike) not the one that went to court \u2013 up to the Supreme Court \u2013 and rescued the party? Has he not supported the party in every way, form and manner? Even God hates injustice.\u201d\n\nOn the PDP candidate sending emissaries to Wike, the lawmaker asked, \u201cDoes that not tell you something? He knows what to do. If you hurt somebody and you cannot face the person, then it simply means that you are not ready for repentance or reconciliation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the report that Wike declined to lead Abubakar\u2019s campaign, the lawmaker asked, \u201cIf na you, you go gree? (If you were in Wike\u2019s shoes, would you have accepted?).\n\nOn his part, a former member of the House of Representatives representing the Etche-Omuma federal constituency, Ogbonna Nwuke, said he agreed with those who said the issue of running mate should be visited.\n\nNwuke, who was also a former Commissioner for Information and Communications said, \u201cThe issue is, quite a lot of people agreed that something was not properly done.\u201d\n\nThe media aide to the National Chairman of the PDP, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said Atiku was responsible for the choice of Okowa as his running mate.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThis question actually ought to be directed at the PDP presidential candidate, His Excellency, Alhaji. Atiku Abubakar. Okowa is not the running mate to Dr Iyorchia Ayu, and neither is it the PDP National Chairman or the NWC that chose him as the running mate to Atiku.\n\n\u201cOf course, the party was involved in the processes leading to the emergence of a running mate, but whatever the party did was only advisory; the choice of who became the candidate\u2019s running mate was ultimately, after all said and done, the decision of the candidate.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing reconciliation process, Imobo-Tswam explained that the party, the national chairman and the candidate were deeply involved in the peace moves at different levels.\n\nThe media adviser to Atiku, Paul Ibe, could not be reached on the demand by Wike\u2019s loyalists as his line was unavailable to take calls on Sunday.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, declined to comment on the demands by the Wike\u2019s camp, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t react to speculations.\u201d\n\nHowever, a highly placed party chieftain and close aide of the PDP standard-bearer argued that replacing Okowa with the Rivers state governor would deepen the crisis in the opposition party.\n\nThe source also noted that Atiku chose Okowa due to the similarities in their ideologies.\n\nHe reiterated the fact that the party would do everything to ensure that the crisis is resolved.\n\nThe source in an interview with one of our correspondents, said, \u201cReplacing Okowa with Wike at this point will further lead to more crises within the party. The candidate has made his choice and while it may not be favourable to everyone, the choice has been made.\n\n\u201cThe choice of Okowa was about ideologies, his ideologies align with the candidate and that is why the candidate chose him as running mate. Wike is a party man. He is strong, we recognize his impact and the need to reconcile.\u201d\n\nOkowa\u2019s camp\n\nReacting to calls that Atiku should drop Okowa, an aide to the governor urged those behind the clamour to channel their energy to how to win the presidency for PDP.\n\nThe aide, who spoke to one of our correspondents in Asaba on condition of anonymity, stated, \u201cIt is the right of the candidate which is Atiku to choose his running mate and that he has done. So, it is not possible to drop Okowa. The man has made his choice.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Olisa Ifeajika could not be reached for comment as of the time of filing this report as calls and messages sent to his phone were not responded to.\n\nAlso, the State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, declined to comment.\n\nBut a former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa blamed the crisis on the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nAccording to him, it would be dangerous for PDP to ignore Wike ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the PDP chairman to resign if he cannot solve the crisis in the party.\n\nBafarawa told journalists that what people see as a crisis would be resolved with the ongoing reconciliation, adding that the 2023 Presidency has moved beyond its presidential candidate to the PDP.\n\nHe was responding to the comments by Ortom, who was quoted as saying that Atiku should have placated Wike after the primaries.\n\nBafarawa said, \u201cThis is a very serious issue which nobody can undermine but unfortunately the problem of this crisis is caused by the leadership of the party. What I am trying to say is that the candidate is no more an aspirant. He is a candidate, he is supposed to be controlled by the party.\n\nBerating Ayu, he stated, \u201cI am not blaming anybody; I am blaming the leadership of the party because they are supposed to swing in and bring the matter down. I don\u2019t want the leadership to take it personally. If there is anything between the national leadership of PDP and Wike it is personal.\n\n\u201cBut being the national chairman, he should forget; even if there is any difference between him and Wike, he is supposed to take away his personal interest and come and rescue the party because he is the leadership, it is the responsibility given to him. If he cannot solve the problem let him resign. But nobody can undermine Wike and nobody can ignore Wike.\u201d\n\nAsked if what had been done to Wike would be a threat to PDP in 2023, Bafarawa said nobody could ignore a governor.\n\nAtiku allays fears\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku has said that despite the internal conflict within his party, he does not see \u201ca divided house\u201d.\n\nHe admonished the party not to lose focus on rescuing Nigeria.\n\nAtiku stated this in a newsletter sent to The PUNCH, in Abuja on Sunday.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOne of the characteristic attributes of democracy that I admire a lot is that it is a system with an intrinsic asset of crisis management. It becomes even more interesting that, perhaps, the most noteworthy outcome of a democratic process is the greater possibility of conflict generation.\n\n\u201cSo, a remarkable lesson that I have learned in politics is that in some instances, conflicts are healthy realities. I know, for instance, that when conflicts arise out of genuine concerns about having an inclusive political process, it signposts the viability of that process and, more importantly, the eagerness of stakeholders to be active participants in the success of such process.\n\n\u201cAs leaders and stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party, the simmering agitations in our party are a reflection of our credentials as a democratic party.\n\n\u201cWhatever our agitations are, I believe it is borne out of collective concern for the growth of our party and the country. Therefore, I don\u2019t see a divided house in the PDP. I see an opportunity for us to come together stronger and united.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a presidential candidate of the PDP, I shall ensure that I do my all to bring the party together under a formidable umbrella.\u201d\n\nIn a move to resolve the crisis, the PDP has announced a nine-member reconciliation committee that would visit the Rivers State helmsman.\n\nDisclosing this on Sunday, the Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, also cautioned party members against unguarded utterances that could further plug the party into a deeper crisis.\n\nThe committee, headed by Atiku, comprises Okowa, Ayu and his National Working Committee, Jibril; BoT members; PDP governors; former governors; ex-PDP minister and some party elders from zones and states.\n\nThis was contained in a statement titled, \u2018Statement by PDP BOT Chairman, Senator Walid Jibrin on the current situation of PDP.\u2019\n\nIt read, \u201cThis was in view of great concern and great sense of feeling on the various recent comments coming from some of our PDP members and some prominent Nigerians on the choice of Chief Okowa, the Governor of Delta State as the vice-presidential candidate by the Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of our party, PDP, the biggest party not only in Nigeria but the whole of Africa.\n\n\u201cAll the comments and various submissions are very normal in any political set-up in Nigeria today with PDP being the strongest and most prominent party that has all potential to form government in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe must come back to our senses by all our members and all most responsible and respectful Nigerians by giving total support to the party to enable it to form government by holding all political positions in Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, very necessary that when our Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and our National Chairman, Senator Iyochia Ayu return to Nigeria very soon from abroad, the following must be done immediately:\n\n\u201cA very important visit must be undertaken to Governor Wike comprising of the following group: The above committee should be headed by the Presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to note that Governor Wike is a very responsible and very obedient member of PDP, who assisted tremendously toward building the party to what it is today. We must, therefore, encourage him to never leave the party.\u201d\n\nHe described Wike as the pillar of the party. A social commentator and political analyst, Jackson Ojo said in the present situation, sending emissaries to Wike was not the way to go.\n\n\u201cWike has every right to be angry. But at the same time, this is a period, this is the season for anybody to have a disagreement, alignment and realignment. Let the party\u2019s NWC and the Presidential candidate walk up to Wike and talk with him now that he is back in the country,\u201d he advised.\n\nAn analyst, Olaseni Shalom, said that Wike\u2019s efforts to unify the party to contest the presidency would be a waste if he decides to hold the party down.\n\nHe also called on Atiku to request a one-on-one and resolve issues, \u201cas the unity of the country was one of the core pillars of his manifesto.\u201d",
          "summary": "If Wike was to be the vice-presidential candidate for Atiku, by now, you know Wike is a very practical person.\n\u201cIn this one, offers were made and people pushed for Governor Wike as the vice-presidential candidate of the party.\nEven God hates injustice.\u201dOn the PDP candidate sending emissaries to Wike, the lawmaker asked, \u201cDoes that not tell you something?\nHe noted, \u201cThis question actually ought to be directed at the PDP presidential candidate, His Excellency, Alhaji.\nLet the party\u2019s NWC and the Presidential candidate walk up to Wike and talk with him now that he is back in the country,\u201d he advised.",

          "text": "The Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Aloy Ejimakor, has given reasons for the persistent insecurity in the southeast.\n\nEjimakor said the perceived injustice meted on the southeast is responsible for the persistent insecurity in the region.\n\nHe lamented that people of the southeast are being blamed for insecurity incidents.\n\nEjimakor disclosed this in a statement he signed and issued on Monday.\n\nAccording to Ejimakor: \u201cBefore post-colonial Nigeria lapsed into its current unitary state, while still passing off as a federation, regional security was largely within the purview of the respective regions, not the federal government. And it worked pretty well.\n\n\u201cThis basic arrangement was not by chance but by well-considered design. Despite their many failings, Nigeria\u2019s indigenous founding fathers and the departing British colonists knew too well that you cannot secure a people within their region without their participation. Even the mighty British empire knew that it couldn\u2019t secure colonial Nigeria without the participation of Nigerians in vast numbers.\n\n\u201cIn a diverse federation of equals (or even near-equals or unequal), Northern Nigerians shouldn\u2019t be the ones exclusively or dominantly securing Western or Eastern Nigeria, and vice versa. When you do that, it becomes counter-intuitive to security and begins to look like belligerent occupation or conquest. It also destroys the neutrality of the security personnel, and engenders ethnic profiling and extrajudicial killings.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, massacres won\u2019t happen if there\u2019s no premeditation, driven by sectarian impulses and lack of compatriot empathy customarily exhibited by some security personnel when it comes to law enforcement outside their regions, even when the targets of such law enforcement are unarmed and amenable to arrest.\n\n\u201cThe inherent dangers of an imbalanced security leadership and formations is the main reason the framers of the 1999 Constitution enacted Section 217(3) of the Constitution, which roughly states that \u2018the composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the Armed Forces of the Federation shall reflect the federal character of Nigeria\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn plain terms, it means that no region or tribe shall be markedly excluded from securing Nigeria or any part thereof, especially its own part. But today, the opposite is the case as Southeast officers and ranks are significantly redlined from all critical security formations, particularly the ones based in the Southeast. It makes no sense and it is unconstitutional to boot.\n\n\u201cStill, for the same reason of sectional balance, Section 14(3) of the same 1999 Constitution provides that, \u2018the composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies shall ensure that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few States or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or any of its agencies\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis means that the Southeast shall be equal partakers in the opportunities of the Nigerian enterprise. But it is not and uniquely so. To be sure, there\u2019s no better contradiction to the oneness of Nigeria than this profound injustice that appears to have become the norm and has persisted since 2015.\n\n\u201cAnd this: Southeast being continually absent from the table partly explains why each time the witch cries at night in the Southeast and the baby dies in the morning, the authorities jump to conclusions that it\u2019s the witch that killed the baby.\n\n\u201cIn other words, almost every incidence of insecurity, including by State actors and others, ends up being blamed on the people of the Southeast, such that they are now left with no other option than rampant resentment, widespread alienation and popular agitation.\u201d",

This is a man whom God has blessed with deep wisdom and wealth of experience, no wonder he is doing wonderfully well. We are proud to be associated with him and he is an example to many of us.\n\n\u201cWe have come to show you that he is not alone on this journey. By the grace of God, Oyetola will be re-elected come July 16. This election is one that is projected to bring progress to Osun, and to Nigeria as a whole. So, we expect Governor Oyetola\u2019s re-election to come with ease and landslide victory.\n\n\u201cThe good people of Osun, if you are privileged to have an uncommon leader, give him all the support possible. If fellow governors can testify that he is a shining light that should give a fair idea of how uncommon he is.\n\n\u201cWe will be here next week for the national campaign for him.

From what we have heard and seen, he has performed excellently well in all sectors and God has used him to bring social development to Osun within the three and a half years he has been administering the affairs of the state.\n\n\u201cHe has done a lot in education, infrastructure, empowerment, and he has built a good relationship with workers, trade unions, traditional institutions among others. This is the confidence we have that it will be a landslide victory for him in the coming election. There is no way this will be an inconclusive election,\u201d the Kano governor noted.\n\nOmisore\u2019s turn\n\nAlso speaking, Senator Omisore and the National Women Leader of the APC, Dr. Betta Edu, said the party had put in place necessary mechanisms to ensure free, fair and credible election.\n\n\u201cWe have heard from our visiting governors what Governor Oyetola represents and what his re-election presupposes. These words are open challenge to us to do what is right for the sake of Osun and its future,\u201d Omisore added.\n\nIn their separate remarks, Director-General of Oyetola\u2019s re-election campaign council, Sen. Ajibola Basiru and the APC state chairman, Prince Gboyega Famodun, described the July 16 governorship poll as critical to the state\u2019s progress, adding that only a progressive-minded candidate deserves to be elected.\n\nAccording to them: \u201cGovernor Oyetola has proven in the last three and a half years that he is capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of the government to the people. Osun is in safe hands with him.\u201d\n\nOlokuku lauds gov\n\nWhile receiving the Governor and members of his re-election campaign council, Olokuku of Okuku, Oba Oyebode, lauded Oyetola for making traditional rulers in the state proud by fulfilling his promises to their subjects.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe wholeheartedly declare our support for Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. You have made us proud and given us enough reasons to speak about you to our subjects with confidence because you have fulfilled your promises to our people.\u201d\n\nOyetola speaks\n\nWhile addressing a crowd of supporters and other residents at the campaign venue, Governor Oyetola commended Osun citizens for the confidence reposed in him, saying their votes in 2018 gave him the privilege to prove his good intention for the state.\n\nHe called on citizens to discern the times and make decisions that can safeguard the future of the state, adding that he is ready to consolidate on the strong progressive foundation he had laid in the last three and a half years.\n\nINEC assures\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Professor Mahmood Yakubu has expressed the commission\u2019s determination to surpass its record in Ekiti by conducting a hitch-free governorship election in Osun state.\n\nHe said the commission had perfected plans and put every machinery in place to achieve a free, fair and credible poll.\n\nSpeaking in Osogbo after assessing the non-sensitive materials, Yakubu said the commission is ready to go on with the Osun governorship election and achieve better results.\n\nThe INEC boss, who went around the state with the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Professor Abdulganiy Raji, and other senior officials, expressed satisfaction with the level of preparation ahead of the poll.\n\nHe met the electoral officers at the commission\u2019s office, Okefia, Osogbo, and advised them to be proactive and do everything necessary to ensure their early arrival at the polling units come July 16.\n\nHe said: \u201cIdentify the Registration Area Centers (RAC) so that on the day of the election, you can activate the centres as early as 6am. We should be waiting for the electorate not otherwise.\n\n\u201cRemember, Ekiti was good, but we want Osun to beat our record in Ekiti and the 2023 General election. We rely on you for transportation arrangement, early movement of materials, liaison with the security, moving them in good time. We must do this right. At the RAC centres, ensure adequate electricity so that they can recharge some of the equipment like the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) and power banks so that on election day we can have a seamless exercise.\u201d\n\nThe INEC boss also visited some polling units designated for the conduct of mock accreditation, saying the exercise had shown 100percent of the commission\u2019s readiness for the election.\n\n\u201cWe are here on readiness assessment of the commission to conduct the election on the 16th of July 2022 and also to visit some designated centres where we are doing the mock accreditation exercise.\n\n\u201cIn this particular centre, we have achieved 100 per cent success for all those who presented themselves for accreditation so far,\u201d Yakubu stated.\n\nHe promised to return to the state next week to meet the stakeholders during which the governorship candidates would sign a peace accord.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The federal government Monday condemned the call by five US Republican Senators asking for the redesignation of Nigeria as a country of particular concern because of alleged persecution of Christians.\n\nThe Senators who made the call in a letter to the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, also alleged violation of freedom of Christians\u2019 rights to practice their religion.\n\nResponding to the allegation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in London, Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed said the call was based on false premise and misunderstanding of what was going on in the country.\n\nNAN reports the minister is in London for engagements with international media as well as some relevant non-governmental organisations.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that only few months ago Nigeria was taken out of the list of countries of particular concern because it was proven that there is no iota of true in the allegation that Christians or any religion was being persecuted or people were not allowed to practice religion of their choice.\n\n\u2018We want to say once again that Nigeria does not have a policy that denies people the freedom to practice their religion. The country also does not have a policy of violation of freedom of religion and it is not true that Nigeria persecutes anybody on account of his or her faith,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed noted that the Constitution of Nigeria guarantees the right of anybody to practice his or her own faith without molestation and the government has always safeguard the constitutional provision jealously.\n\nHe said most commentators who were not well versed in the politics and happenings in Nigeria took criminalities and communal clashes as issues of religious persecution.\n\n\u201cNobody in Nigeria is being persecuted, but we have issues of criminality going on and the criminals really do not make distinction of any religion.\n\n\u201cThey kidnap for money, they hold people on ransom irrespective of their religion and there are some issues of communal matters dating back to many years.\n\n\u201cIf statistic is to be taken, I can say confidently that as many Muslims as Christians have been victims of these criminals,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said the only known group that target Christians was the Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nHe, however, said that the federal government had mounted large scale military operations to wipe out the criminals and it is yielding results.\n\n\u201cWhat ISWAP is doing is that because of their dwindling influence they are now attacking Churches and Christians in order to create crisis between various religious groups. But as a government, we are after them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said some NGOs were also feeding the international community with wrong information to get funds from donors.\n\nMohammed reiterated that the two major religions in Nigeria-Islam and Christianity \u2013 were also collaborating to find solution to the crisis and return the country to the path of peace.\n\nHe gave the example of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), which is working to foster unity and better understanding between the Christian and Islamic faiths.\n\nThe minister solicited support from multilateral organisations and foreign countries in tackling the challenges if insecurity.\n\n(NAN)\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call on the marketers to show more sense of patriotism by taking into cognisance the pains they put other Nigerians through just to make profit.\n\nWe commend the NNPC GMD for standing firm for Nigeria in this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc. has called on Civil Servants to be dedicated to duty for improved productivity.\n\nAdegbite made the call during the celebration organized by the ministry to commemorate the 2022 African Public Service Day in Abuja.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction working with staff of the ministry due to their commitment to duty which he stressed should be sustained to take the ministry to enviable heights.\n\nDelivering her speech at the ceremony, Permanent Secretary, of the Ministry, Dr Oluwatoyin Akinlade, revealed that efforts were on to ensure that the ministry blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation.\n\nAkinlade who hailed the passion of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, HCSF, Folashade Mejabi Yemi-Esan, for improved productivity and welfare of civil servants, said the theme of the day, \u201cPerformance Management System, PMS: Impact on productivity in the Nigeria Public Sector\u201d was most apt as it summarises the vision of the HCSF to make the service a world class system that drives optimum productivity through effective and efficient performance management.\n\n\u201cShe has vigorously pursued the full implementation of the new Performance Management System through training of various categories of officers. This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

We just have Fulani herdsmen right in front, followed by these bandits, and again ISWAP; so, the three of them work together and they work separately.\u201d\n\nAt least 40 people were killed and many injured when gunmen opened fire on worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, the headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State.\n\nThe incident which occurred on June 5 sparked widespread condemnation with various individuals and groups calling on the government to ensure the assailants were arrested and brought to justice.\n\nThe security agencies were too quick to link the incident to ISWAP.

When they do things, they say we have done it; they take pride in these heinous crimes.\n\n\u201cI expect that if ISWAP had done this, all this while they would have come out and own up but some of us have our fears that it is not ISWAP and we do not agree with that position.\u201d",

          "title": "Why I visited Nnamdi Kanu in detention",
          "text": "Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukuma Soludo has explained why he visited the detained leader of the proscribed People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody.\n\nSpeaking with Sam Omatseye on TVC Breakfast show on Monday, the former governor of Central Bank said the move was informed by his resolve to dialogue with anyone and everyone who can help his administration to restore peace and order in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, I did make it a point that I am ready to dialogue with anybody and everybody who will bring security and order to the state. And in that, we met with transporters, traditional rulers and prepared to give amnesty to those in the bush.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that, Nnamdi Kanu is the leader of IPOB, and it has Eastern Security Network. It is important to have full coverage in such that we need to bring everybody on board. I paid him a visit and I am very impressed by what he said in the presence of Senior DSS officials that he is detested by the spilling of innocent blood by some criminals unfortunately operating under the names of IPOB or ESN. But it\u2019s evident to me that quite a number of criminal gangs have emerged because it\u2019s a lucrative criminality \u2013 kidnapping, stealing etc. It has become lucrative business for them. Every criminal gang now claims to be a liberation movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne good thing is that I am happy hearing him denounce criminality, hearing him expressing regret about how things have become, he even told me he is not the one who authorised sit at home. And I didn\u2019t quite understand that initially and severally, his own officials of IPOB have been issuing statements condemning the sit at home and different gangs issuing counter statements. He has his followers but all we want is peace, law and order so that we have the desired development in the homeland.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to question about Kanu\u2019s sincerity, governor Soludo said he cannot read Kanu\u2019s mind or judge him by what he has said in the past. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have the gift to know what\u2019s going on in his mind. Whatever anybody said yesterday, may not matter, anyone could learn from history. The substance for me is hearing him regretting how the homeland has become and consequently asking his supporters to embrace peace and that\u2019s what my take away, not whatever he had said in the past. Now I have a job to do, and my primary role is to provide security for my people.\u201d\n\nMr Soludo who decried the state of criminality in the state, said his administration is determined to return peace and security to the homeland. \u201cWe are determined to return peace to the homeland.\u2019 We are pursuing security, peace and order in all fronts using the carrot and stick approach and the Anambra people are united about this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI must commend the Federal government and the security agencies. Nigeria is facing a lot of security challenges but I must commend them for the assistance. I must say so far so far, we are in sink. By the time I came, there was total silence, nobody was read to give information but that has changed now. There are seven numbers around me and people are cooperating.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former CBN governor said his first one hundred days in office is both challenging and interesting. He however said he is not actually a fan of the 100 days in office school of thought, adding that there\u2019s nothing unusual about the days because he was fully aware of the enormous tasked ahead when he applied for the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I am not a believer in the 100days of a thing but since you guys in the media kept asking, I think I have to create time to address some of what we have been able achieved. The 100days as I said in my address is pumping, it is challenging as expected. But I must said I applied for the job and the good people of Anambra employed me and when I applied I knew the challenges ahead. So no big surprises I must say.\n\nSpeaking on what informed his low key inauguration, the governor said governance is not about the glamour and noise people think it is about, but service to the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d The inaugural reminded us what governance is about. It\u2019s not about glamour, it\u2019s about service.\n\nWe just need to constantly remind ourselves of what governance is all about. On my first day in office, I spent about 8hrs plus. The first three and half hours was an extensive meeting with the security chiefs trying to review the humongous security challenges we have. I didn\u2019t come for the job to answer \u201cyour excellency\u201d I am hired to provide security, create enabling environment for business to thrive, create economic wealth. That\u2019s why they hired me. So I get to work every morning to address governance which is service to the people. We are the employees, the people are the employers.\u201d\n\nGovernor Soludo said the recommendations by his transition committee led by Dr Obby Ezekwesili are already being incorporated into his administration policies. \u201cThe Ezekwesili\u2019s committee came together and worked very hard. I must commend them for the great job they did. Basically, we have three operating documents \u2013 first, the Soludo solution, Anambra vision 2070 which I chaired and the transition committee report. Indeed these documents constitute our agenda for the state. We are determined to deliver on them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement",

He has held office at the federal level and at the state level, and he has done well in every office. He has always stood for progressive policies. He is not afraid of difficult decisions. This is a man that is running a state government with appointees from all over Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis capacity is not in doubt. His personal ability is outstanding.

          "text": "Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, on Sunday said that with the surging participation of Nigerians in the oil and gas sector, local operators are now responsible for as much as 50 per cent of gas production and 30 per cent of crude oil output.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja last night at the Independent Petroleum Products Group (IPPG), Gala in celebration of the industry icons, Komolafe stated that at least 29 assets have been divested in recent years and are now being operated by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs at today, I am proud to say that indigenous companies contribute about 30 per cent of crude oil and 60 per cent of gas production as well as 40 per cent and 32 per cent of oil and gas reserves respectively,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that today, seven indigenous companies are among the top 20 with the highest oil reserves in the country.\n\nHe stated that the IPPG remains a major force in the exploration of the nation\u2019s hydrocarbons resources for optimal value addition, promising to ensure a clement regulatory environment for the oil producers.\n\nThe NUPRC boss recalled that prior to 1970, the Nigerian oil and gas space was dominated by foreign companies in the upstream and downstream sectors, with the first award of oil blocks to two indigenous companies failing because of lack of finances and technical know-how.\n\nSince then, Komolafe noted that there have been a number of programmes where 30 blocks were awarded on sole risk basis, while 24 were awarded between 2003 and 2004.\n\n\u201cOver 29 assets have been divested between 2009 till date presenting an opportunity for indigenous companies,\u201d he stated.\n\nFifty seven fields, he recalled were recently issued in 2020 resulting in 102 Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPLs) issued by the commission to indigenous companies.\n\nHe revealed that Nigeria has the largest participation of local operators in the oil and gas space among all petroleum producing countries in Africa, arising from a robust local content policy.\n\n\u201cAs a regulator, the commission is not oblivious of the threats posed to the development of the Nigeria\u2019s hydrocarbons industry by divestments of the IOCs which is mainly attributable to a hostile upstream environment arising from the menace of crude oil theft and energy transition,\u201d he added.\n\nHe urged the IPPG to see the divestment in the IOCs assets as an opportunity rather than a threat, stressing that it was time to look inwards and deploy their competences in the industry.\n\nKomolafe posited that the energy demand in Africa by 2040 will increase by 30 per cent compared to the current level, adding that divestment from onshore and shallow water will give a huge chance to local IPPG members.\n\nHe urged IPPG to remain competitive, adopt innovation in decarbonisation and cost efficiency, ensure good relations with host communities and be prepared to make the right investment in gas infrastructure.\n\nAccording to him, section 52 has set out the oil and gas fund which he said could be good for mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and synergies.\n\nThe IPPG is an umbrella body of the indigenous Petroleum Exploration and Production (E&P) companies in Nigeria. The Group was established in 2015 with the primary objective of promoting and advancing the development of the Nigerian energy industry.\n\nIt has 25 members which engages government and other industry stakeholders on matters affecting the industry with a view to realising a sustainable industry aspirations and maximising its contribution to the socio-economic development of Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman IPPG, Abdulrasaq Isa, noted that improving in-country value extraction of Nigeria\u2019s hydrocarbon resources and supporting the country\u2019s energy security remain one of the lofty goals of the group.\n\nHe commended the President, Muhammadu Buhari, for his steps to lift the petroleum industry through the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as well as his support for the group and lauded the transparent conduct of the recent marginal fields bid rounds.\n\nAccording to him, the event was held to recognise individuals who contributed immensely to the sector in the past years.\n\nSome of those honoured included the Pioneer Chair of Seplat, Ambrosie Orjiako, Austin Avuru of Platform Petroleum, Abdulrasaq Isa of Waltersmith, Dr. Tunde Afolabi of Amni International and Layi Fatona, Pioneer Managing Director of Niger Delta E&P.\n\nOthers were: Danjuma Saleh of Waltersmith, Charles Odita, formerly of Shell and Midwestern Oil,Oluseye Fadahunsi , Adebayo Ayorinde, Osariemen Owieadolor, Ignatius Ifelayo, Ebiaho Emafo, Pade Durotoye and Dr Ladi Bada.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Sunday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately recall the former Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and Ambassador to Benin Republic, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (rtd) to face investigations and clear his name over alleged connection with the N1.8 billion recovered by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in a property in Abuja.\n\nIn a statement, the National Publicity Secretary, PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said the party\u2019s demand for the recall and investigation of Buratai was predicated on the earlier assertion by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Babagana Monguno, after the exit of Buratai as COAS that the $1 billion drawn from the national coffers under the APC administration for the purchase of arms to fight terrorism in the country could not be traced.\n\nThe PDP said the assertion by the NSA heightened suspicion on allegations of barefaced looting of money meant to equip the security forces.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cSuch corruption under the APC administration has led to the upsurge in unhindered terrorism attacks, mass killing of citizens and loss of many of our gallant fighters in the front in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of serious interest to Nigerians when reports that the ICPC discovered the sum of N1.8 billion in various currencies, expensive cars and jewelries secreted in a property in Abuja allegedly linked to the former COAS broke out.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the PDP said, \u201cThere are already apprehensions that the discovered money is part of the security fund that was criminally diverted. This is especially against the backdrop of the frenzy and spirited efforts by certain quarters linked to the APC to suppress investigation and free flow of information, politicise the matter and sweep it under the carpet.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged Nigerians to recall that it had on several occasions alleged that the looting of the treasury was officially sanctioned and enabled by the APC administration with its refusal to prosecute those who were alleged and found to have been involved in massive corruption.\n\nIt further recalled it had also alleged that the PDP drew attention to plans of the APC to create a slush fund account from monies fraudulently drawn from the national treasury to finance their plot to rig the 2023 general elections.\n\nThis, the PDP said was evidenced by the alleged massive use of money by the APC to prosecute a vote buying scheme in the recent Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of vote buying in that election by the APC was even acknowledged by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Yakubu Mahmood, which prompted the INEC Chairman to demand for speedy trial of those arrested for vote buying in the Ekiti State election,\u201d the PDP stated\n\nThe PDP also said reports of massive looting by APC leaders and their cronies in government Ministries, Departments and Agencies further confirmed the ruling party was a haven for treasury looters.\n\nMoreover, it said the recent alleged looting of N80 billion by the suspended Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, \u201cwhich investigation has now gone cold is suspected to have been engineered by the cabal at very high level of the APC administration.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the PDP, the spokesperson said the party is standing with Nigerians, insisting that Buratai should return to the country and personally face investigation to clear his name.\n\nIn view of this, the PDP stated: \u201cThis is because any allegation bordering on looting of funds meant for the fight against terrorism is of grave national concern and consequence. It must be thoroughly investigated and anybody found wanting must be made to face the full weight of the law no matter how highly placed.\u201d",
