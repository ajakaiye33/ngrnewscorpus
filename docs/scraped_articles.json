But while Abiy promised a swift victory, more than nine months later the TPLF has made advances into the neighbouring Afar and Amhara regions.\n\nAid workers are struggling to reach cut-off populations, with 400,000 facing famine-like conditions in Tigray, according to the UN.\n\nOn Tuesday, Abiy\u2019s office issued a statement calling for \u201call capable Ethiopians who are of age\u201d to join the armed forces as the conflict escalates.\n\nThe TPLF has said it is not seeking to reclaim power at the national level and is instead focused on \u201cdegrading\u201d pro-government troops and trying to facilitate aid access to Tigray.\n\n(AFP)",

Lawal said.\n\nHe said that NAVTRAC\u2019s task was to continue to train and retrain officers and ratings for an efficient Nigerian Navy.\n\n\u201cRecently, we graduated 19 Special Boat Services (SBS) operators from our SBS school and it is gratifying to note that nine of those officers and ratings are from Ghana Navy.\n\n\u201cSo, on our part we have been training sister African countries as to contribute to our fight against piracy in the Gulf of Guinea,\u201d the FOC said.\n\nHe reiterated the need for the Nigerian Navy and Spanish Navy to collaborate in the area of training especially technical trainings for officers and ratings.\n\n\u201cI congratulate you on the efforts that you have been putting in the fight against piracy both in the Indian Ocean and in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\n\u201cI ensure you that the Nigerian Navy on it\u2019s part will not relent on it\u2019s effort in the fight against piracy and illegal activities in our maritime environment,\u201d Rear Adm. Lawal said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Spanish Ambassador to Nigeria, Marcelino Cabanas Ansorena said that ensuring a secured maritime environment through collaboration was important because of the volume of trade between the two countries.\n\n\u201c80 percent of the trade with Nigeria goes through the Gulf of Guniea therefore, it is important for us to participate and collaborate with you.\n\n\u201cTraining will be one part of the collaboration exercise as well as sharing information which is important to update knowledge on security about the sea and the Spanish Navy vessels,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ambassador said that Spain would like to share from it\u2019s experience, gathered from fighting piracy over the years with the Nigerian Navy to improve security in the Gulf of Guniea.\n\n\u201cSpanish Navy vessels have quite an experience in the fight against piracy even now, we have command of the Western Navy vessels at Operation Atlanta in the Indian Sea.\n\n\u201cSo, we will like to collaborate and share of these experiences that we have to improve our bond and strengthen our bilateral relationship,\u201d Ansorena said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

However, a minority judgment of three justices of the apex court questioned the validity of the Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and declared it illegal.\n\nIt held that the party erred by allowing a sitting governor to hold the position of party national chairman in clear breach of section 183 of the 1999 constitution (as amended).\n\nThe PDD in an originating summons filed on August 12, 2021 by it\u2019s counsel, Chief Emeka Etiaba (SAN) has urged the court to order the Chief Judge in Yobe State or any other relevant judge in his absence to immediately swear in Umar Iliya and Daguma Baba Abba Aji as governor and deputy governor of the state as the offices have become vacant.\n\nListed as defendants in the suit are Governor Mai Mala Buni, Idi Barde Gubana and All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nIt further urged the court to declare that having regard to the clear provisions of section 187 (1) of the 1999 Constitution and the state of law, Idi Barde Gubana of All Progressive Congress, cannot lawfully occupy the office of governor or deputy of Yobe State upon cessation of the Buni occupation of the office of governor of Yobe state.\n\nIt also prayed for a declaration that the action of Mai Mala Buni as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC while he remains the governor of the state are wrongful, null and void. The party posed the following questions for the determination of the court: \u201cWhether the 1st defendant (Buni) did not breach the clear provisions of section 183 of the 1999 Constitution when as the governor of Yobe State, he accepted the 3rd defendant (APC) appointment as its caretaker Committee Chairman and proceeded to occupy the office.\n\nWhether the 1st defendant(Mai Mala Buni) who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd defendant (APC) has not ceased to hold the office of the Governor of Yobe State, having regard to the provisions of section 183 of the 1999 constitution. It also sought the court to adjudicate on having regard to the clear provisions of section 187(1) of the 1999 constitution and the state of law, whether the 2nd plaintiff (Dama Gum Baba Abba Aji), can lawfully occupy the office of the governor or deputy governor of Yobe State upon the cessation of Governor Buni occupation of that office.\n\n\u2022We\u2019ll meet him in court \u2013Buni\n\nIn his response, Buni said though he has not been served, he has no iota of doubt that the suit will not see the light of the day.\n\n\u201cWe have not received any court notification to that regard and we believe that nothing like such suit exists. However, even if such suit exists, we will not only meet him in court, but we are also very optimistic that the suit will be thrown out,\u201d he said throughhis spokesman, Mamman Mohammed.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo [email protected] 07064781119\n\nAmid crushing financial challenges facing the Federal Government and its extant policy of tenure limitation for directors and permanent secretaries in the federal civil service, it has been revealed that about eight of its directors in the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) have refused to retire from office more than five months after their tenure expired.\n\nThis was even as there are no official policy of tenure elongation for the affected directors.\n\nFAAN and NCAA sources told Daily Sun that the continued stay in office of the retirees has frustrated attempts by the Minister of Aviation, Mr Hadi Sirika to recommend fresh names for the replacement of the retiring directors who have also continued to receive salaries and allowances, thus negating the civil service policy reforms put in place by former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe affected directors in FAAN whose four-year tenure has elapsed include Sadiku Rafindadin, Director of Commercial and Business Development; Nike Aboderin, Director of Finance and Accounts; Honoris Anozie, Director of Human Resources and Administration; Group Captain USA Sadiq, Director of Aviation Security Services.\n\nDaily Sun reliably learnt that the above directors were appointed from outside the agency, while Salisu Daura, an engineer in the agency grew through the ranks in FAAN to emerge Director of Engineering Services.\n\nHowever, he recently reached the retirement age of 60 on August 5 and has not been replaced.\n\nMeanwhile, in NCAA, the retiring directors still in office after attaining the mandatory retirement were appointed on February 27, 2017 are Tayib Adetunji Odunowo, Director of Aerodromes; Bilkisu Adam Sani, Director of Finance and Account; Group Captain Edem Oyo-Ita, Director of Air Transport Regulations, and Ahmed Abbas Sanusi, Director of Human Resource and Administration.\n\nTenure limitation policy\n\nThe tenure limitation policy, which aims at ensuring that most civil servants that are qualified are able to attain directorship status in the federal civil service as well as permanent secretary status was introduced by Obasanjo\u2019s administration following the setting up of the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) on February 4, 2004. Part of the reforms of the bureau was the introduction of a policy of four years of two terms for directors and permanent secretaries even if such persons were below the age of 60 and had served for less than 35 years in the civil service at the end of their terms.\n\nPart of the reason the policy was put in place was because there were civil servants that had been directors or permanent secretaries for more than 13 years, which was congesting the system because those that were due for promotion to the post of directors were not promoted as there were no vacancies at the top level of the service.\n\nWhen the late President Musa Umaru Yar\u2019Adua took office in May 2007, his administration upheld the tenure limitation policy, saying it was primarily meant, \u201cto institute due process in the appointment of directors and permanent secretaries, arrest the succession crisis in the service, create vacancies, reinvigorate the system and boost the morale of qualified and deserving officers.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s public service rule 2007 as amended in 2009 under Yar\u2019Adua covers the recruitment and retirement of public servants\n\nSubsection (I) of the rule 020810, states that; \u201cThe compulsory retirement age for all grades in the service shall be 60 years or 35 years of pensionable service, whichever is earlier.\u201d Subsection (ii) states that; \u201cNo officer shall be allowed to remain in service after attaining the retirement age of 60 years or 35 years of pensionable service, whichever is earlier.\u201d\n\nSubsection (iv) of the rule states that; \u201cProvided the officer would not have attained the retirement age of 60 years or spent 35 years of pensionable service, whichever is earlier; (a) a director shall compulsorily retire upon serving eight years on the post, and (b), a permanent secretary shall hold office for a term of four years and renewable for a further term of four years, subject to satisfactory performance, and no more.\u201d\n\nIf due process is to be followed according to the public service rule, it indicates that the employment contract signed between the Federal Government and the directors elapsed when their tenure ended in February, hence whatever salaries and allowances they are still receiving without an extension or renewal of their appointment can be deemed illegal.\n\nNo agency head has the power to appoint a director. In effect, the Director General of NCAA and the Managing Director of FAAN cannot be held responsible for the failure to appoint new directors as such decisions are only made by the supervising minister.\n\nDaily Sun reached out to the Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, James Odaudu, to find out when new appointments would be made and he responded by saying that, \u201cwhatever the minister does is at the pleasure of the President.\u201d\n\nGrowing through the ranks\n\nThe peak of civil service is level 17 which is the position of a general manager in aviation agencies and in some exceptional cases, a level 17 officer can be promoted to the position of a director but this is largely dependent on the government in power and the disposition of the aviation minister at the time. An example of such instances is Daura who grew through the ranks in FAAN, became a general manager and was later appointed a director.\n\nSources within both agencies tell Daily Sun that the position of a director has been political and in a parasatal, you can be over the retirement age as most of the current directors are above 60 years old but that the day their tenure expires is when their contract is supposed to end and it can either be renewed or they are removed. When such political appointments are made, in most cases, due to the fact that those appointed usually have little experience, they are forced to start learning the ropes and most often, have to be guided by the general managers in their respective departments.\n\nHowever, members of staff of both agencies are hopeful that when new appointments would be made, considerations to head very critical departments would be given to the many core professionals within the system who are general managers and are usually more knowledgeable about the job.\n\n\u201cFor instance, engineering is one of the most sensitive and technical departments and if you bring someone who is not a core professional, things will get messed up. The director of that department was a good fit because he is an engineer and he grew through the ranks in FAAN to become a director,\u201d a source said.\n\nMinister yet to inaugurate aviation boards\n\nThe failure to appoint new directors is not the first time the minister of aviation would be flouting civil service rules and setting aside due process.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari, directed all ministers to inaugurate the boards of the various agencies and parastatals under their supervision but three years after, Sirika is yet to comply with the order.\n\nThe directive came after President Buhari appointed 209 board chairmen and 1,258 board members in December 2017, the largest set of appointments he made after assuming office at the end of May 2015.\n\nPresident Buhari had issued the directive through a circular signed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, for ministers to proceed with the inauguration of the boards on or before Friday, March 9, 2018. Mustapha said his office had already streamlined the constitution of the boards in accordance with the statutes and sent the list of the chairmen and board members to the various ministers.\n\nAccording to the Act setting them up, the agencies whose boards ought to have been inaugurated are FAAN, Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), NCAA and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET). The Act setting up the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) does not provide for a board of directors.\n\nOne of the reasons cited by industry sources for the delayed inauguration of the boards was that the minister raised an objection that the Federal Government did not consider the qualification of the persons to be appointed into the boards, while announcing their compositions as required by the Acts establishing the agencies.\n\nBut some stakeholders in the industry said the minister ought to have officially met with the appropriate authorities to address the perceived challenge in the composition to avoid giving the impression that he wants to run the agencies as a sole administrator.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nNo fewer than 816 persons have died from cholera infection as outbreak of the epidemic continues to ravage more communities across the country, Director General, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, has said.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, in Abuja, during the 18th ministerial briefing organised by Presidential Communication Team, he said the epidemic has spread to 22 states, warning that over 31,000 people have been infected.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, faulted ongoing doctors strike under the auspices of National Association of Resident Doctors(NARD), saying embarking on an industrial action in the midst of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic with the arrival of Delta variant, cholera outbreak in 22 states and marburg virus (similar to Ebola) was not only dangerous but unconscionable.\n\nWhile acknowledging the danger the COVID-19 Delta variant has brought to the country, Ehanire, however, ruled out another lockdown of the country.\n\n\u201cLockdown is a very last measure that countries are taking because lockdown stifles economic activity, restricts freedom and your businesses \u2013 corporate, government, private business all are affected. So it\u2019s not something you do easily. And of course when we were compelled to have lockdown at the beginning, we learnt a lot of lessons. You know, at that time government provided palliatives to mitigate the impact if you couldn\u2019t go to market or couldn\u2019t do your business. But this is not what government is aiming to do; no government wants to lockdown. In countries where they have serious threats, they had to do what they call a precision lockdown, like in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe minister decried the strike by doctors appealing to them to return to work.\n\n\u201cI think Nigeria is probably the only country in the world today where doctors are dropping work in the middle of a threat to the whole country. So that\u2019s what we have advised. There has been no threat. We are just appealing, all of us are doctors, all of us went through the same residency. We\u2019re saying this is not the time let\u2019s continue to talk about it. Do not put people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d\n\nHe said Federal Government would apply the International Labour Organisation (ILO) policy of \u201cNo Work, No Pay\u201d, if the doctors insisted on carrying on with the strike, saying they would not be paid from tax payers money for doing nothing.\n\nHe also denied threatening to sack resident doctors who withdrew their services since August 2 over alleged poor conditions of service, saying all engagements and consultations so far have been to appeal to them to call off the strike.\n\nHe said majority of the demands raised by the doctors were under the jurisdiction of state governments.\n\nDirector General of National Agency For Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, explained that recent delays associated with the application of mModerna vaccines donated by the US government was as a result of laboratory testings where some insignificant quantities had bar-coding errors which had to be sorted.\n\nShe said the agency was working round the clock to resolve the slight hitches which had nothing to do with the vaccine quality.\n\nShe said in the previous vaccination exercises 12,000 Nigerians reported mild side effects.\n\nExecutive Director/CEO, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuiab, said in order to further combat the spread of COVID-19, the Federal Government has procured over 29 million single dose of Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines at the cost of $298.5 million (over N122 billion) to enable the country vaccinate 70 per cent of eligible members of the population.\n\nHe said 176,000 doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccines that arrived the country with roll out schedule for Monday, was part of 29 million doses the government procured that is being expected.\n\nShuaib said the J&J doses would be administered to those who are in hard-to-reach areas.\n\n\u201cThe balance of the vaccine will subsequently be delivered in monthly tranches,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis batch of J&J vaccine will be focused on those who are in the hard-to-reach areas, riverine.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Wants party\u2019s governorship candidate, running mate in last election sworn in\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe filing of a suit, yesterday, in Abuja, by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking the sack of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni and his deputy, Idi Gubana, could mean more trouble for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as momentum gathers ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe party\u2019s woes took a worrisome dimension in July, when a minority judgement of the Supreme Court held that Buni violated the 1999 Constitution by performing the duties of a sitting Governor and Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee \u2013 both executive positions.\n\nThe judgement has since July 28 continued to tear the party further apart alongside pro-Buni and anti-Buni tendencies, with the Minister of State for Niger Delta and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Festus Keyamo, warning about future disasters if Buni was not immediately removed as chairman of APC.\n\nKeyamo and others, like Senators Babafemi Ojudu and Ita Enang, had raised concerns about future elections, particularly, in a situation, where the convention to elect new leaders of the APC was conducted under the Yobe State governor.\n\nAlthough the pro-Buni group within the party has continued to maintain that the Supreme Court judgement did not fault the chairman\u2019s position as governor and, hence, passed a vote of confidence on his committee to proceed with its planned congresses and national convention.\n\nWhile the crisis rocking the party had been mainly internal, a new dimension was introduced yesterday with the filing of a suit by the PDP leadership, this time seeking the removal of Buni as governor of Yobe State, over alleged breach of constitutional provisions barring a sitting governor from holding two executive offices at the same time.\n\nApart from Buni, PDP, citing section 187(1) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, also sought the removal of Gubana from office as deputy governor.\n\nPDP, in the suit dated and filed August 12, specifically alleged that Buni violated Section 183 of the constitution, when as a governor he accepted to serve as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) of APC had last year appointed Buni and others to manage the affairs of the party for a period of six months, which has been extended twice. Buni\u2019s appointment was sequel to the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) of APC. This was after Oshiomhole was suspended from his ward in the build-up to the Edo 2020 governorship poll.\n\nBoth the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal had held that Oshiomhole, having been suspended by his ward, could not continue to preside over the activities of APC.\n\nAlthough Oshiomhole did not challenge the dissolution of the NWC then, some aggrieved party members had approached the court seeking to stop the Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nWhile the party would be battling on the one hand to legitimise the Buni-led committee, the Yobe State governor, on the other hand, would be battling to save his office as governor.\n\nOutside Buni and Gubana, other defendants in the suit filed by Umar Damagum and Baba Aji included the APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nIn the suit filed on their behalf by their lawyer, Chief Emeka Etiaba, SAN, the plaintiffs insisted that Buni ceased to be a governor from the moment he accepted to act as APC caretaker committee chairman.\n\nAmong the issues raised for determination by the court were, \u201cWhether the 1st Defendant did not breach the clear provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Regublic of Nigeria 1999 as amended) when as the governor of Yobe State he accepted the 3rd Defendant\u2019s appointment as its Caretaker Committee Chairman and proceeded to occupy the office?\n\n\u201cWhether the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Charmin of the 3rd Defendant, has not ceased to hold the office of the govermor of Yobe State, having regards to the provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)?\n\n\u201cHaving regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court Eyitayo Olayinka Jegede and Anor And Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Appeal No: SC 448/2021 delivered on July 28, 2021 whether the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant has not ceased to hold the office of the governor of Yobe \u2018State?\n\n\u201cHaving regard to the clear provisions of Section 187 (1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeran 1999 (a amended) and the state of the law whether the 2nd Defendant can lawfully occupy the office of the governor or deputy governor of \u2018Yobe State upon the cessation of the 1st Defendant\u2019s occupation of the Yobe State governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs submitted that if the questions were answered in the affirmative, the court should declare \u201cthat the 1st Defendant breached the clear provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) when as the governor of Yobe State, he accepted 3rd Defendant\u2019s appointment as the Caretaker \u2018Committee Chairman and proceeded to occupy the office\n\n\u201cA Declaration that the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant has ceased to hold the office of the governor of Yobe State having regard to the clear provisions of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended).\n\n\u201cA Declaration that having regard to the judgment of the Supreme Court on Eyitayo Olayinka Jegede and Anor And Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Appeal No SC 449/2021 delivered on the 28 day of July 2021, the 1st Defendant, who is the governor of Yobe State and the Caretaker \u2018Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant has ceased to hold the office of the governor of Yobe State\n\n\u201cA Declaration that the actions of the Ist Defendant as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the 3rd Defendant while he remains the governor of Yobe State are wrongful null and void,\n\n\u201cA Declaration that having regard to the clear provisions of Section 187 {1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the state of law, the 2nd Defendant cannot lawfully occupy the office of the governor or deputy governor of Yobe State upon cessation af the 1st Defendant\u2019s occupation of the office of the governor of Yobe State\n\n\u201cAn Order directing the Chief Judge of Yobe State or any other relevant judge in his absence to immediately swear in the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs as governor and Deputy governor of Yobe State, the offices having become vacant.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for hearing of the suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Iwuanyawu: June 12 annulment not his sole decision, he didn\u2019t kill Dele Giwa\n\n*Akilu: Vasta was killed because he wasn\u2019t innocent of foiled \u201986 coup\n\n*Abubakar: He\u2019s needlessly misunderstood\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nSome elder statesmen and eminent Nigerians, many of whom played key roles in the administration of former Military President Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, have come out to address some of the age-long thoughts about his leadership, with a view to owning their own narrative.\n\nThose who took the pain to explain away some of the issues that have stigmatised Babangida included a former Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar; a member of the defunct Armed Forces Ruling Council, Gen. Haliru Akilu, and a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT), Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu.\n\nThey addressed issues as the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, the mindless killing of a renowned journalist, Dele Giwa, and the killing of Mamman Vasta in the wake of the foiled 1996 coup.\n\nThey all spoke at the maiden edition of IBB legacy dialogue, which is one of the products of the IBB and Maryam Babangida Presidential Library. The colloquium was designed as part of events to mark Babangida\u2019s 80th birthday coming up next Tuesday, August 17.\n\nGenerally, the speakers called on leaders across the country to emulate the inclusive leadership qualities of the former military president in managing Nigeria\u2019s multi-ethnic polity and raised concern over the retrogression of intellectualism in governance.\n\nThey also expressed concern about poor handling of Nigeria\u2019s multi-ethnic nature, and set the agenda for the future. They said future leaders of the country should have a broad network of friends across the country in order to ascertain the true situation of things across Nigeria.\n\nReflecting on his relationship with Babangida, Iwuanyanwu, who echoed the need for inclusive government, however, defended IBB over June 12 annulment and described the news that he killed Dele Giwa as fake.\n\nIwuanyanwu stated, \u201cI am not worried about the stories about IBB. A leader must be swift to respond to false comments about him. That story on Dele Giwa is fake news. not properly responded to.\n\n\u201cOn the cancellation of the June 12 election, none of the council members protested or resigned, because of the cancellation of the result. Maybe after this, the narrative will improve.\u201d\n\nIwuanyanwu, who said IBB impressed him as a friend and leader in many dimensions, hailed his inclusive leadership abilities in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria.\n\nWhile appreciating his leadership qualities, Iwuanyanwu said, \u201cWhen you assume leadership of a multi-ethnic country, you must carry everybody along.\u201d\n\nHe urged secessionist groups to desist from stoking the embers of war, noting that having experienced war just like Babangida, it was not a tea party.\n\nIwuanyanwu said, \u201cWe are warning the younger ones causing trouble, it is not a tea party. I fought in the war and he (Babangida) fought and we suffered injuries.\u201d He added that when Babangida came to power, he assured those who fought the war on the side of Biafra of inclusion and \u201che made it real.\u201d\n\nIwuanyanwu explained, \u201cHe (Babangida) had people of all parts working for him. It is an example other leaders must learn. He didn\u2019t neglect any ethnic group; he carried them all along. To have confidence in a people called rebels is why Igbos have confidence in IBB. He married our daughter. He gave us respect.\u201d\n\nThe PDP BoT member recalled that Babangida founded the Raw Materials Development Council in order to address the way foreigners were exporting raw materials from the country.\n\nRecalling how the former president spent the whole day at his hometown in Imo State, when he buried his father, Iwuanyanwu said, \u201cHe is an excellent leader. He is being misrepresented. All leaders are misrepresented. But it is for the leader to tell his story if he does not tell it others will tell it for him. He should say with joy that I came, saw and conquered.\u201d\n\nAkilu, on his part, defended IBB over the killing of Vasta.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for those bringing the case of Vasta, they should go and dig deeper and find out what happened. We were there and we had a tribunal that looked into the case. If Gen Vasta were innocent, nobody would have convicted him. Unfortunately, he was the most senior officer behind the attempted coup in 1986. So, people should not jump to conclusions.\u201d\n\nAkilu said he was attracted to Babangida during the civil war, when Babangida, as a young military officer, defended a junior officer from a bully military officer.\n\n\u201cThere was an incident that attracted me to him. He stood up for a junior officer, who was being bullied. He cared for the junior officers working under him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described Babangida as a gifted person, who is kind to a fault. Akilu recalled how the former military president gave out his only car to a friend, who needed it.\n\nAkilu said, \u201cHis loyalty to his friends is legendary. He will never betray you no matter what. He will never forsake his friends. If you are his friend, he will never abandon you.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the failure of successive administrations to follow in the steps of Babangida in building more barracks for the military so that the military will have comfort.\n\n\u201cI thought that successive administrations would build more barracks but no additional barracks have been built for the military.\u201d\n\nAkilu decried the lack of maintenance of the federal secretariat, which was built by the Babangida regime.\n\nOn the relocation of the federal capital territory from Lagos to Abuja, Akilu said, \u201cHe was courageous to take the right decision at the right place and time even when many of us were saying it was not the right time.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution on \u201chow he built his tribe\u201d, Abubakar, extolled the virtues of the former military president and underscored the need for leaders in the country to carry everybody along in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar, while underscoring the leadership qualities that endeared Babangida to many Nigerians, said, \u201cOnce you are a leader, everybody is yours. You are supposed to look after the welfare of all of them.\u201d\n\nAbubakar, who recalled his early childhood years with Babangida, said the former military president displayed leadership qualities from a young age, serving as class monitor in primary school and later as head boy in secondary school.\n\nRegretting that the Babangida was one of the most misunderstood Nigerians, Abubakar noted that Babangida has the love of Nigeria at heart.\n\nHe reflected on the institutions established under the Babangida administration, adding that Nigerians are now reaping the fruits of the numerous agencies created under his watch.\n\nThe former head of state said, \u201cIBB has the love of the country in his heart. He is one of the most misunderstood Nigerians but by and large, you can see that what he has established over the years; we are seeing the benefits. Abuja is one of the greatest and fastest growing capitals in the world. He is quite accommodating and generous to a fault. He can deprive himself to make sure someone is okay.\u201d\n\nOther dignitaries at the event included former governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu; former Senate President David Mark; former Minister of Information, Prof. Jerry Gana; former Minister of Education, Prof Tunde Adeniran; media mogul and Chairman of Daar Communication Group, Raymond Dopkesi; and Gen Olagunsoye Oyinlola.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says Delta variant infection not enough for another lockdown\n\n*May apply \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 policy against striking doctors\n\n*Cholera outbreak recorded in 22 states, infects 31,000, and 816 deaths\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe federal government on Thursday gave an update on its fight against the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the country, saying it has spent some N122 billion to procure the Johnson & Johnson vaccines for the citizenry.\n\nIt, however, noted that the number of delta variant infections so far recorded across the country did not warrant another lockdown as witnessed in the wake of the pandemic last year.\n\nThe on-going strike action embarked upon since the beginning of the month by doctors under the aegis of National Association of Resident Doctors ((NARD) also received the attention of government, which threatened to apply the \u201cno work no pay\u201d policy if the doctors failed to return to work.\n\nMeanwhile, the cholera outbreak is reported to have affected 22 states with a total of 31,000 people infected and 816 deaths.\n\nExecutive Director/CEO of National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuiab, who spoke at the weekly ministerial press briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the State House, Abuja said in order to further combat the spread of the dreaded Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in the country, the federal government has procured over 29 million single dose of Johnson and Johnson vaccines at the cost of $298.5 million (over N122 billion).\n\nThis, he stated, was to enable the country vaccinate 70 per cent of eligible members of the population.\n\nAccording to him, the 177,600 doses of Johnson and Johnson vaccines that arrived the country with roll wout schedule for Monday, was part of 29 million doses the government procured that is being expected.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, while talking on the third wave of Covid-19 brought about by the delta variant said, \u201clockdown is a very, very last measure that countries are taking, because lockdown stifles economic activity, restricts your own freedom and your business \u2013 corporate business, government business, private business \u2013 all are affected.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not something you do easily. And, of course, when we were compelled to have that lockdown at the beginning, we learnt a lot of lessons. You know, at that time government provided palliatives to release the impact of it; If you couldn\u2019t go to market, if you couldn\u2019t do your business.\n\n\u201cBut this is not what government is aiming to do. No government wants to do a lockdown. In countries, where they have had serious threat, they have had to do what they call a precision lockdown like in the UK. In fact, Israel the other day announced that they\u2019re doing some lockdown, but there\u2019s no more generalised lockdown but precision lockdown of certain areas.\n\n\u201cSo many countries do what they call precision lockdown so that not everybody will be affected, only certain areas to avoid too much damage to the economy, to social life. And we are not at the level yet where we are feeling that threat to do any lockdown. And as I speak to you now, there are several countries that are on one kind of lockdown or the other. If my recollection is correct, at least six or seven countries are doing one form of lockdown or the other. We do not have that on the table right.\u201d\n\nThe minister also used the forum to appeal to striking doctors, under the auspices of National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), saying embarking on an industrial action in the mid of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic with the arrival of Delta variant, cholera outbreak in 22 states and Marburg virus (similar to Ebola) outbreak was not only dangerous but unconscionable.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government would not hesitate to apply the International Labour Organisation\u2019s policy of \u201cNo Work, No Pay\u201d, if the doctors insisted on carrying on with the strike, stressing that they would not be paid from tax payers money for doing nothing.\n\nHe also denied threatening to sack resident doctors, who withdrew their services nationwide since August 2 over alleged poor conditions of service, explaining that all the engagements and consultations so far have been to appeal to them to call off the strike.\n\nFurther on the doctors\u2019 strike, Ehanire said it was not a good time for doctors to go on strike.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe\u2019re having a strike for the third time this year. That is not good. We have appealed to them. We have been having long meetings with young doctors to tell them that look, we have a certain responsibility to our country.\n\n\u201cEvery country that has difficult situation at this time should understand that responsibility is on all of us if you have any problem, any grudge let\u2019s talk about it. If we can\u2019t solve it now, let\u2019s continue talking about it until we fine solution but don\u2019t drop work.\n\n\u201cI think Nigeria is probably the only country in the world today where doctors are dropping work in the middle of a threat to the whole country. So, that\u2019s what we have advised. There has been no threat. Nobody threatened anything. We are just appealing. All of us are doctors; all of us went through the same residency.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying this is not the time; let\u2019s continue to talk about it. Do not put people\u2019s lives at risk. That\u2019s what the Minister of Labour has been saying, that is what the minister of Health has been saying. Nobody has threatened anybody with anything.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded of the threats of no work no pay, the minister said, \u201cYes, but that\u2019s a standard thing. That\u2019s International Labour Organisation (ILO) recommendation that if you did not work, then why will you take\u2026your salary comes from taxpayers money.\n\n\u201cSo, if you did not work, why should you be paid, because if that is so you can be encouraged to stay home for six months and your salary is running from public funds, from taxpayers money, when you have not given the community any service?\n\n\u201cSo, that no work, no pay is not just the government regulation, it is specifically stated in International Labour Organisation that if you do not work, if you have not given any service, you can\u2019t expect regulation, because you can\u2019t go to market and buy something for nothing. You must put down something, you must put down work.\n\n\u201cYou cannot go to market and take goods without paying. So, if you work, you will be paid. And we are strongly in support of government meeting its obligations to pay what is agreed. We have said that we shall push for that, you know, working with the salaries and wages commission, the head of service, we are working to support that including paying all the insurance dues.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot go against what the ILO says: pay people that did not go to work. I mean, I think before God and man, you can defend that position, but there is no question of threats. These young doctors are professionals, not just professionals, they are young people, who we need to also mentor and treat well, to the best of all our capacity here.\n\n\u201cSo, the strike is not what we want now. We would like to again, use this platform to ask doctors to return to work, let us negotiate. We can do that among us. There are many areas the Ministry of Health supports them. But part of the problem we have is that some of the grudges that they have, or let us say the demands are with state governments not the federal government. So, if the state government has not paid some people salary, why go on nationwide strike?\n\n\u201cWe say if you want to talk to that state, I will support you and appeal to the state. Among the 12 original demands that they made, seven were state related. They\u2019re not federal, federal government cannot compel a state to pay you a certain salary that you want. But the ones that are concerning us at federal level, many of them are not even exactly the Ministry of Health either.\n\n\u201cBut we support them and say strike is not a good tool to use. And especially when the health of the country is threatened, when people will come out and volunteer in other countries to work. That is not the time to withdraw your own service. And I think again, we\u2019ll continue to appeal to young doctors not to use strike as a tool, especially, at a time of national need that will not rest well on your conscience.\u201d\n\nOn her part, Director General of National Agency For Food Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Professor Mojisola Adeyeye, explained that recent delays associated with the application of moderna vaccines donated by the United States was as a result of laboratory testing, where some insignificant quantities had bar-coding errors, which had to be sorted.\n\nAccording to her, NAFDAC has been working round the clock to resolve the slight hitches, which had nothing to do with the vaccine quality, adding that in the previous vaccination exercises, 12,000 Nigerians reported mild side effects.\n\nOn his part, the Director General of National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, said recent outbreak of cholera was now in 22 states of the federation, with over 31,000 people already infected and 816 deaths.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says IOC must get consent, negotiate NNPC\u2019s pre-emptive rights before asset sale\n\n*19 OMLs listed for divestment\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe road to the planned sale of Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s assets in Nigeria appears clearer now, with Wood MacKenzie, a leading global oil and gas consulting firm, putting the total value of Shell Petroleum Develop Company (SPDC), the subsidiary it proposes to totally divest from, at about $2.3 billion.\n\nLast week Tuesday, THISDAY had reported the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) as saying it would protect the interest of Nigeria in any transaction involving international oil companies interested in divesting from the country.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the corporation, Mr Mele Kyari, who addressed the issue in our report then had also said the NNPC cannot stop any of the oil concerns from deciding to sell off any of their assets as far as the rules are followed.\n\nPart of the conditions for consummating the deal, Wood MacKenzie, stated in a document obtained by THISDAY yesterday, also includes that the International Oil Company (IOC) must get consent as well as negotiate the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC) pre-emptive rights before the assets would be sold.\n\nTwo weeks ago, THISDAY had reported that the parent company had launched a major divestment of its Nigerian assets, especially those in the shallow-water and onshore and that the oil giant had already hired Standard Chartered to sell its SPDC, in a deal which could be one of the biggest in Africa.\n\nA Shell spokesman had told THISDAY that the company was in talks with the Nigerian authorities to ensure a smooth transition in whatever course the company decides to take concerning its activities in the country, but declined to go into the specifics.\n\n\u201cDiscussions with the Nigerian government are ongoing on the next steps for our onshore business in Nigeria. We are in the early stages of reviewing the commercial options,\u201d the Shell official had stated.\n\nIn May, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, had while speaking at the company\u2019s annual general meeting, said Shell could no longer afford to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage in its Nigerian operations.\n\nBut according to the latest document, 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) would be put up for sale by the oil giant in onshore locations and shallow waters in the company\u2019s eastern and western operations in the Niger Delta.\n\nBut the company is only selling its 30 percent equity in the Joint Venture (JV) assets, while the rest is owned by NNPC (55 percent), Total (10 percent), while Eni owns percent in the NNPC-Shell JV.\n\nWood MacKenzie, also known as WoodMac, described the move as radical, saying the decision could have seemed unlikely only 12 months ago, but was highly symbolic of what the energy transition means for IOCs in Africa, especially 63 years after the company produced its first barrel in Nigeria.\n\nIt listed the assets up for sale as OML 11, OML 20, OML 21 (Assa North), OML 22 (Enwhe), OML 23 (Soku), OML 25, OML 27, OML 28 (Gbaran-Ubie), OML 31, OML 32, OML 33, OML 35, OML 36, OMLs 43 and 45 (Forcados-Yokri), OML 46, OMLs 74 & 77 and OML 79.\n\nGiving a background to the company\u2019s decision to divest from the facilities, MacKenzie stated that emissions from Shell\u2019s assets in the onshore and shallow water delta are among the highest in its global portfolio.\n\nIt stated that this was due to ageing infrastructure, under-investment, vandalism, continued flaring and the harsh operating conditions, adding that until now, Shell has sold oil blocks but kept gas blocks supplying Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG).\n\nIt further stated that the integration of the assets with oil infrastructure coupled with the ever-present security risks may have further persuaded Shell that a clean break from the onshore delta is, on balance, preferable.\n\n\u201cAlthough Shell would rely on third party gas supply into NLNG (in which it holds 25.6 per cent), existing contracts would be novated to a buyer, while it can meet most of its Train 7 supply from OML 144, which is outside the JV.\n\n\u201cThe domestic gas market continues to be extremely challenged as evidenced by the recent announced 13 per cent cut in gas-to-power prices. Rather than sell single OMLs, Shell is seeking buyers for asset packages in the eastern, western and shallow water delta,\u201d the firm stressed.\n\nHowever, the report stated that before any major decision could be taken, Shell must negotiate with NNPC (holder of 55 per cent in the JV assets), on the terms of a sale.\n\n\u201cThis could cover NNPC\u2019s pre-emption rights, treatment of outstanding JV liabilities including decommissioning, the fate of the JV\u2019s terminals, transfer of staff, and host community approval,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to MacKenzie, Shell\u2019s priority was identifying credible buyers and ensuring deal completion and wants to limit negotiations to hand-picked bidders only, thus avoiding a long drawn-out process, but would need NNPC\u2019s buy in.\n\nHowever, the oil and gas consulting firm raised posers over the possibility of getting buyers, although it admitted that Nigerian independents and new entrants were eager to acquire under-invested assets with plenty of volume upside.\n\n\u201cPlaying at home, their acceptance of risk differs markedly from international E&Ps, so there will be few in the latter category. But in the energy transition era, can bidders raise enough finance to acquire, and invest in, a challenging portfolio of swampy assets?\u201d it asked.\n\nIt noted that deal financing would be necessarily complex to mitigate risks, but pointed out that the recent OML 17 transaction highlighted that with a consortium of buyers backed by local and international lenders with multiple layers of debt, commodity traders would see off-take opportunities in return for funding and some may even consider equity.\n\nAccording to the report, Shell itself may provide finance to help smooth deals and could maintain an indirect interest in the OMLs, perhaps within a special purpose vehicle, coupled with a clear exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThis would get assets off the balance sheet, and provide more comfort to lenders. Contingent payments might also feature. Innovative solutions will be needed. A complete sell-off would be historic. However, all 19 OMLs will be extremely hard to shift in the current environment,\u201d it said.\n\nMacKenzie disclosed that there could be as much as four billion barrels of Oil Equivalent (BOE) across the JV.\n\n\u201cHowever, we consider only 20 per cent to be commercial due to a lack of investment, crude theft, insecurity and gas market constraints. Five of the OMLs are undeveloped.\n\n\u201cOur valuation of Shell\u2019s 30 per cent in the JV (excluding export pipelines and terminals) is $2.3 billion, at Net Present Value (NPV) 10, Jan 2021, $50 long-term oil price. But this is based on the current sub-optimal, business-as-usual investment profile,\u201d it noted.\n\nMacKenzie stressed that a competent buyer/operator, giving priority to the assets, could commercialise much more than 20 per cent of the resource base, although the availability of funding for the JV partners will, as ever, dictate how much.\n\nThe firm said the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) overhauls the fiscal regime offering materially lower oil royalties and taxes, hence, there was much more upside than downside to its base case, which bidders would need to carefully quantify.\n\n\u201cFew, apart from Seplat have created value through Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A). Overpaying for resources in the ground has been disastrous for some previous buyers, so an appreciation of what is fair value given all the above-ground risks and opportunities is essential,\u201d it added.\n\nIn February, a Dutch court held Shell\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary responsible for multiple oil pipeline leaks in the Niger Delta and ordered it to pay damages to farmers, leading van Beurden to call its Nigerian onshore assets as a \u201cheadache\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s onshore joint venture SPDC has sold about 50 per cent of its oil assets over the past decade, with its stake in SPDC giving it 156,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent in 2020, of which 66,000 barrels were oil.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Rebecca Enonchong, one of Africa\u2019s most prominent tech entrepreneurs, is reportedly set to appear before a court in her home country, Cameroon, on Thursday after she was arrested on Tuesday, August 10.\n\nThis is according to Edith Kah Walla, the leader of the Cameroon People\u2019s Party (CPP).\n\nWalla had earlier revealed in a series of tweets that the Cameroonian entrepreneur had been arrested and was being held at the Gendarmerie Legion (a police station) in Douala, apparently by government order and without any arrest warrant.\n\nAccording to Walla, the United States-based Enonchong was called to the Gendarmerie for a case involving her family.\n\nWhile meeting with the Attorney General (Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), she reportedly asked that her cases be handled by one investigator rather than two. The request was considered an \u201coutrage \u00e0 magistrat\u201d (contempt of court) by the AG, who ordered her immediate arrest.\n\nHello All!\n\n\n\n1st, Congrats for amazing mobilization today.\n\n2nd, stay mobilized. @africatechie is still under arrest. She will sadly spend another night at the Gendarmerie Legion.\n\n\n\nAafter 4 hours of ping-pong between the Magistrate, the Attorney General & the Legion Commander. \u2014 Kah Walla (@KahWalla) August 11, 2021\n\nEnonchong remains in police custody and has been scheduled to appear at the Bonanjo Court of First Instance, Douala, on Thursday morning.\n\nOutpouring of support\n\nThere\u2019s been a flux of support at home and abroad for the Cameroonian entrepreneur since reports of the arrest \u2013 which has been described as unlawful, illegal, and an abuse of power \u2013 surfaced.\n\nEnonchong\u2019s detention has sparked outrage online with many individuals and organisations calling on the government to restore her freedom, in a country where such arbitrary detentions aren\u2019t uncommon.\n\nThe hashtag #FreeRebecca has gone viral on social media and an initiative, FreeRebecca.com has been launched to protest against the arrest.\n\nA statement issued by the African Business Angels Network (ABAN) described the action of the Cameroonian government as \u201chighly irresponsible.\u201d The network of early-stage startup investors was co-founded by Enonchong, who serves as a Board Member and Trustee of the organisation.\n\nWe have seen Rebecca at the Gendarmerie.\n\nShe is in good health & excellent spirits.\n\nKeep retweeting #FreeRebecca.\n\nMake as much noise as possible.\n\nShe is being held with no written complaint.\n\n\n\nThe Attorney General verbally requested her arrest for \"outrage\" against himself! https://t.co/8FxfOLSxlq \u2014 Kah Walla (@KahWalla) August 11, 2021\n\nWho is Rebecca Enonchong?\n\nThe 54-year-old Enonchong is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of AppsTech, a global provider of enterprise software solutions, which she launched in 1999.\n\nEnonchong is also the co-founder of I/O Spaces, ABAN, and Cameroon Angels Network. She sits on the boards of many corporations including AfriLabs Foundation, ActivSpaces, Digital Africa, WHO Foundation, Eneza Education, Suguba, Djibouti Telecom, US Exim SAAC, and the UNECA Center for Digital Excellence.\n\nEnonchong is an advisor to Venture Capital for Africa (VC4Africa), the largest online community dedicated to entrepreneurs and investors building African companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn 2017, she was named as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans in Science, Tech & Innovation by the New African Magazine and Jeune Afrique\u2019s 50 Most Influential Africans.

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

We are beginning to witness an increase in COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\n\u201cThis visit is to check our response arrangements and emergency facilities, which we used for the first and second waves of COVID-19 to make sure that they are in shape and are ready for the response that we are currently planning for the third wave.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State COVID-19 response team has been reactivated; l am the chairman of the team and the deputy governor is the chairman of the Technical Committee.

Now they understood the anthem they sang every day during the three weeks camp orientation exercise to actually mean that they signed up to the clarion call irrespective of the atmospheric condition.\n\nBut the rainy Thursday sensitization exercise was just a prelude to the sanitation exercise that would come on Saturday, 17th July, 2021 National Environmental Sanitation Day which NYSC set aside for Corps members to carry out environmental sanitation and sensitization in their various host communities.\n\nThe disciplinary NYSC officials in Oredo have not doubt instilled discipline in the serving Corps member which has put the Corps members always on the go when duty calls. So when the Corpers\u2019 Liaison Officer (CLO), Afemi Samson posted a reminder on the WhatsApp group that reads:\n\n\u201cAttention Corps members, there will be a National Environmental Sanitation Day! Which will hold on Saturday, the 17th of July, 2021.Corpers are advised to come out in large numbers to clean their environment, and also sensitize the people on Sanitation! Irrespective of your CDS group or where you stay, you are all advised to participate in making your environment clean\u2026\u201d they were not dazed a bit!\n\nOn Saturday, 17th July, corpers serving within Benin metropolis were spotted in every nook and cranny of the town carrying out sanitation. From cutting of grasses to disposing of waste bins. As usual what ordinarily would have been tiring turned out to be fun filled as they exhibited a high level of team spirit on the exercise.\n\nCommunity Development Service (CDS) is one of the four cardinal programmes of NYSC in which corps members contribute positively to the development of their host communities throughout the period of national service. Corps members are expected to use one day in a week for group CDS activities. They are not expected to attend duties in their places of Primary assignment on CDS days. Such days are dedicated to the execution of projects and programmes that will improve the living conditions of their host communities.\n\nThere are 16 CDS groups, one of which is Enviromental Protection & Sanitation group (NEMA/NESREA vanguard) that carries out sanitation on weekly basis but to commemorate the epochal National Environmental Sanitation Day, Oredo Corps members irrespective of the CDS groups all turned out en masse to carry out the sanitation exercise.\n\nIt is worthwhile mentioning that since its inception in 1973, the National Youth Service Corps has been making great contributions in the social, political and economic transformation of the nation.\n\nIn recent times, NYSC has been in the vanguard of the nation\u2019s drive to correct the imbalance in our rural-urban development through the various community development programmes executed by corps members. These programmes have revolutionized our communities in the areas of education, environment, healthcare delivery, agriculture, communication, infrastructure, technology, economic empowerment, poverty eradication, social services and above all national consciousness and socio-cultural regeneration.\n\nBy carrying out this selfless and patriotic exercise, the Corps members have underscored the commitment of the scheme to a clean and sustainable ecosystem that supports the life of all living in it, man, plants and of course animals.\n\nKeeping our environment clean is the duty of every citizen, from personal hygiene to our surroundings, let cultivate the culture of cleanliness. Remember the popular adage that says \u201ccleanliness is next to godliness\u201d.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving Corps member with The Nigerian Observer, Benin City.\n\n...",

          "title": "Sterling Bank partners Nexford to create global talent pipeline",
          "text": "Sterling Bank Plc, and Nexford University, a United States (US) based next generation online university, have announced a new partnership that will create a global emerging markets\u2019 talent pipeline known as \u201cFund Your Future\u201d as part of Nexford\u2019s wider \u2018Learn to Earn\u2019 for emerging markets.\n\nMr. Obinna Ukachukwu, Divisional Head, Health and Education sectors with Sterling Bank, who disclosed this in a statement issued by the bank recently, said the programme is designed to solve three major challenges of enabling employers to find qualified entry level talent, helping students with affordable access to university and giving students the skills they need to actually get jobs.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the World Economic Forum\u2019s index, Nigeria scored 44 percent on human capital development when measured by skills acquisition, trailing the sub-Saharan African average of 55 percent by 11 percent. Also, Nigerian employers face the most difficulties in filling managerial, professional and technical jobs due to lack of skilled applicants.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the index also showed that 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s high school graduates failed to gain admission into local universities and other institutions of learning while employers across emerging markets struggle to find qualified entry-level talent and are forced to invest in expensive and time-consuming training.\n\nThe Divisional Head added that a McKinsey survey of young people and employers in nine countries, including major developing countries, showed that 40 percent of employers noted a lack of skills was the main reason for entry level job vacancies while 60 percent said new graduates were not adequately prepared for the world of work.\n\nUkachukwu remarked that the benefits of the partnership for Sterling Bank are multiple. \u201cFirst is access to student talent. The students are given an education specifically tailored to the bank\u2019s corporate needs. This saves Sterling Bank money on current early stage training to upskill graduates to the required level. Nexford\u2019s competency-based curriculum also provides Sterling Bank with multiple data points to evaluate applicants\u2019 qualifications, thus saving time on filtering large numbers of applications and the wider recruitment process.\u201d\n\nHe said the students will also benefit as Sterling Bank will be playing two roles of helping the students to underwrite loans to fund their tuition fees with Nexford. This will protect them against fluctuations in foreign exchange and put them in control of their finances.\n\nHe said Sterling Bank will also provide the students with partial scholarships and internships during their studies, in addition to post-graduation job opportunities.\n\nThe wider context is that in markets such as the US, employer-funded education has grown significantly with $82.5 billion spent on upskilling in 2020 alone. The World Economic Forum also stated that one billion workers will need to be reskilled by 2030. While the need for upskilling globally is significant, the availability of a young population across emerging markets means their economies would face significant shortages of qualified entry level talent.\n\nFadl Al Tarzi, CEO of Nexford University said, \u201cWe are delighted to partner with an institution privileged to have such forward thinking leadership. This is a perfect match and surely the first of many such partnerships.\n\nHe said in each market, Nexford will partner with a different organisation so that employers will identify the skills they need and Nexford will identify the programmes to deliver those skills. When learners complete the programmes, they will have a far greater chance of gaining employment.\n\nOlamidun Majekodunmi, Country Director of Nexford University said, \u201cOur partnership with Sterling Bank is a perfect example of how Nexford is helping to bridge gaps between employers and higher education. We are committed to making access to qualified talent far easier for employers while making education more accessible and relevant for learners.\u201d\n\nIn 2020 the university launched its \u2018Nexford for Business\u2019 programme, focused on reskilling and upskilling employees. Employers of large number of workers such as Dangote Cement in Nigeria, Indosat in Indonesia and Hassan Allam Holding in Egypt have already partnered with Nexford to upskill their employees.\n\nLaunched in 2019, Nexford leverages machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a data and skills-driven curriculum, specifically designed to match employers\u2019 needs with its graduates\u2019 skills. It has learners enrolled from over 65 countries and has partnerships with Microsoft, LinkedIn Learning and IBM to provide access to tools, courses and programmes to enrich the learning experience.",

There is a third party that provides them, and these providers are also registered by the Ministry of Labour. These providers give the casual workers two-year employment,\u201d she stated. \u201cAt the end of the two years, the contract is renewed with a new term. The union is trying to create a career path that at the end of the second year, there should be some negotiations.

          "text": "The Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, has advised doctors in the country to be humble and carry themselves with dignity, rather than \u2018play God or compete with God\u2019.\n\nNgige gave the advice while speaking at the 2nd Summit of Medical Elders Forum (MEF) on Thursday, in Abuja.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the forum, organized by the Africa Health Budget Network (AHBN), in collaboration with 50 forward, had as its theme, \u201cMedical Profession: a Look into the Past, Present and Future.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNigige expressed his concerns over the state of health nationwide and opined that the medical profession was in danger.\n\n\u201cAt no time in the history of NMA and the medical association, was I seeing our association and our profession ever being in danger, as I am seeing them now.\n\n\u201cMany people will not see it, but from where I am sitting and standing, I can see danger ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the oldest professions on earth, metamorphosing from natural and traditional healers to take away pain from people and consequentially save lives.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t create lives, God creates, we only preserve people\u2019s lives through the act of God. In doing so, God has given us some powers and those powers are near his own to create.\n\n\u201cBut, there is something God does not want, God does not want when he gives you powers you use it to try to say that you are like him or you are competing with him.\n\n\u201cGod loves you to do that which he has asked you to do; to use that power with humility.\n\n\u201cDoctors should ask themselves questions; why is it that it\u2019s when your colleagues are in government that you go on the greatest number of strikes?\n\n\u201cSome of these colleagues were Presidents, Secretary-Generals of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and even NARD,\u201d Ngige asked?\n\nAccording to him, Dr Onyebuchi Chukwu and Dr Isaac Adewole have had to face plenty strikes. And since our government came on board, I have consolidated four strikes; something is wrong.\n\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves some questions and be straightforward with the answers\n\n\u201cWe must start by telling ourselves the truth. You say they dislike doctors, what did you do for them to dislike you?\n\n\u201cYes, there is peer envy; yes, some wanted to study medicine and they couldn\u2019t; we know it and if you know it, you carry yourself with dignity and humility,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, NMA\u2019s President, Prof. Innocent Ujah, had said a good number of people within and outside the health sector were envious of doctors, without appreciating the tedious academic process of becoming a doctor.\n\n\u201cEverybody is envious of the doctor, what is the problem? What have we done? Is it a sin to be intelligent? By the way, we are the most intelligent,\u201d he stated.\n\nUjah, who raised concerns over the release of some circulars by the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) and the National Universities Commission (NUC), stated that they were contradictory.\n\nHe explained that such contradictions formed part of the reasons behind the disharmony in the nation\u2019s health sector.\n\n\u201cA circular from the Salaries and Wages Commission is coming out that no more CONMESS for doctors, who are lecturers.\n\n\u201cBut, it is there as a circular, so why is the doctor singled out?\n\nIn Lagos state university, a doctor with fellowship cannot contest the Vice Chancellorship\n\n\u201cWithout a PhD you can\u2019t teach at the clinical level, you can only teach biochemistry or physiology: and you are saying that the best can no longer be a Vice Chancellor.\n\n\u201cHe can become a professor but he can\u2019t become a Vice Chancellor, what kind of contradiction is that?\n\n\u201cWe have written from the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria to tell them to stop that, if they don\u2019t, we will challenge it, because we cannot take what we are seeing.\n\n\u201cSome circulars from the NUC are quite contradictory and we need to sort them frontally and you can see the dismemberment.\n\n\u201cThese are the things that cause problems for us. When we try to solve some of these issues other issues crop up.\n\n\u201cWe need support from our elders; people value us but we don\u2019t value ourselves. We should be able to resolve our conflicts and those who are in government should know that they are doctors, you will come back to us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Executive Director, AHBN, Dr Aminu Magashi, noted that for the health system of any country to deliver quality health care services to the population they serve, there must be strong political leadership commitment and effective health system governance.\n\nMagashi said others are adequate healthcare financing, human resources for health, effective regulation and legislation, and strong private health sectors.\n\nHe added that the medical and dental profession was critical and key to the socioeconomic and political growth and development of any nation, including Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe profession, which is driven largely through the Nigerian Medical Association and its affiliate bodies, has been a major pivot for repositioning and advancing the profession.\n\nHe, however, lamented that \u201cthe effort of various governments to translate the association\u2019s laudable recommendations for the growth, development and good of the profession, the health system and the Nigerian people, had been less than satisfactory.\n\n\u201cAn association like the NMA, serves as a watchdog of government and through constructive engagement with the government, help to deliver quality and smooth health care delivery to the Nigerian population,\u201d he explained.\n\nMagashi said both should work as committed partners for progressive developments rather than as antagonists.

          "summary": "The Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, has advised doctors in the country to be humble and carry themselves with dignity, rather than \u2018play God or compete with God\u2019.\nNgige gave the advice while speaking at the 2nd Summit of Medical Elders Forum (MEF) on Thursday, in Abuja.\n\u201cSome of these colleagues were Presidents, Secretary-Generals of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and even NARD,\u201d Ngige asked?\nThe Executive Director, AHBN, Dr Aminu Magashi, noted that for the health system of any country to deliver quality health care services to the population they serve, there must be strong political leadership commitment and effective health system governance.\n\u201cThe profession, which is driven largely through the Nigerian Medical Association and its affiliate bodies, has been a major pivot for repositioning and advancing the profession.",

When everybody, every Nigerian, anywhere you go in the village, you will find a Hausa man, a Yoruba man, an Igbo man, Itsekiri and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cSo, when you say you divide, where do you draw the line with the inter-marriages and so on and so forth? It is going to be difficult.\u201d\n\nOn the security challenge currently facing the nation, Abubakar called for a collective effort to tackle the menace just as he urged the citizens to expose those perpetrating the heinous acts.\n\nAbubakar, who chairs the National Peace Committee, further said the criminal elements behind the nation\u2019s security woes lived among the populace, \u201cso, let us expose them to the authorities and let us put our hands on deck to tackle the security challenges.\u201d\n\nHe spoke glowingly on the former military leader whom he said demonstrated leadership right from his childhood when he was made a class head in elementary school and a head boy in his secondary school days.\n\nAbubakar who said IBB was just a year older than him, recalled that in their school days, IBB was a monitor and was also called Maigari, an attestation to his leadership qualities which stood him out in his childhood.\n\nHe further said, upon graduating from secondary school, Babangida joined the military, where \u201cas an officer and gentleman, the ex-Head of State, also displayed his leadership qualities.\n\n\u201cLeadership is about caring and it is about managing resources, people and personnel under you. He exhibited these leadership qualities even before he became an officer.\u201d\n\nMark speaks\n\nAlso in his remarks, Senator Mark, who served as the military governor and communications minister at different times under the IBB-led government, said like any other person, his erstwhile boss was seen differently by different persons.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd there are those who feel, like somebody said, they can be blindfolded, they will follow him to anywhere he decides to go.\u201d\n\nDescribing the former Nigerian leader as one with \u201ca human heart, a feeling, and a personal touch he brought into governance,\u201d the former Senate president noted that \u201cthe way he sympathises with people is unique and truly, it is very, very unique.\n\n\u201cFor people like me, I mean, he was like a protector, a mentor in the Armed Forces. And for so many of us, that is exactly what he is. So, I think I am not surprised that there are people who, regardless of what he says or does, will believe him and there are those who will be against him.\u201d\n\nDokpesi too\n\nSimilarly, the occasion\u2019s chairman,Chief Dokpesi was full of praises for the former military president, even as he faulted what he called the misconceptions around the former military ruler.\n\nHe described IBB \u201cas the most talked about ex-leader in the country,\u201d attributing it to his sterling qualities and the glamour the former military ruler brought to governance.\n\nThe media guru, who went memory lane, absolved Babangida of blame in the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election that would have produced Chief MKO Abiola as president.\n\nHe also dismissed the insinuations around the alleged missing $12 billion oil windfall under the regime.\n\nIn her remarks, for Deputy Governor Ojikutu, stated that the choice of Maryam, the military ruler\u2019s wife, was the beginning of the IBB vision.\n\nAlso, another speaker, Dr Chidi Amuta, praised the ex-military president for his \u201ceffective management of our diversity, which is absent in today\u2019s Nigeria, as he has always been surrounded by people from different walks of life,\u201d a reason he said IBB remains a detribalised Nigerian.\n\nAkilu speaks on Vatsa\u2019s execution\n\nAlso speaking to journalists at the event, a former Director of Military Intelligence (DMI), Brigadier-General Haliru Akilu (retd), said contrary to the narratives in certain quarters, Babangida was not solely responsible for the execution of a former Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Major-General Mamman Vatsa.\n\nVatsa, a senior military officer and associate of the former military ruler, was executed alongside some military officers for their role in a coup to topple the Babangida administration March 5, 1986, barely one year after coming on board.\n\n\u201cWhen you know General Babangida, you will understand that these narratives did not fit the picture. As the leader then, Babangida had to follow the right process of the military trials of any act of treason and there are persons bestowed with that responsibility.\n\n\u201cBabangida laid solid infrastructural development for the nation during his regime. We have that bringing the country\u2019s Federal Capital back to Abuja. This was a great decision that only leaders of Babangida\u2019s capacity can do.\n\n\u201cThe second is the building of military barracks in Abuja, the building of the National Assembly Complex, the Aso Rock Villa (State House), the Federal Secretariat as well as economic and social empowerment of Nigerians, especially women with the establishment of the Better Life for Rural Women as well as MAMSER.\u201d",

I think I have served long enough in the Villa to know the dynamism in the power at the center. I\u2019m the dullest person, at least I still have to offer something that will be meaningful. This is why I said let me give it a shot if it be, fine and good and if it doesn\u2019t the Almighty Allah will not say you did not come out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Coalition, Chairman Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Coalition, Mr. Tunde Imolehin, mooted that there was a need for the party to build a foundation that would make it sustainable.\n\nImolehin who was a member of the APC national membership registration) revalidation committee for the Southwest maintained that Yuguda fall in the category of party leaders who can direct the affairs of the party, someone whom everybody would listen to any time he speaks due to his rich background and experience.\n\n\u201cI believe we are here to begin a journey we will never regret, a journey that will be sustainable.

We set up a risk analysis team yesterday, evaluated the risk for Nigeria. It is low at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we did is to make sure that we have the facilities to detect this if there were to be a suspect case. We are watching out for travel and working with our colleagues in the Port Health Services to look at the travel history of individuals that travel.\u201d\n\nThe NCDC boss explained that the agency is working with the West Africa health organisation and Africa\u2019s Centre for Disease Control to provide the needed support to combat the deadly virus.\n\nDoing \u2018The Simple Things\u2019\n\nWhen asked what roles Nigerians could play to avoid the spread of the virus, Ihekweazu advised on simple preventive measures.\n\n\u201cWe need to learn to do the simple things while not losing the beautiful aspect of our culture that mingle us together,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cRight now, if it is our culture to have a big ceremony as a wedding that put together thousands of people into an enclosed space, the fact is that within the context of COVID that will expose you and your guest to significant risk.\n\n\u201cYou have to mitigate those risks by limiting the number of people you are inviting, insisting on masks wearing, insist on a certain level of distancing. There is a conflict between our culture at the moment and the threat that we face.\u201d\n\nAccording to past outbreaks, the average fatality rate is 50 per cent, in a range of 24-88 per cent.\n\nThe virus is part of the so-called filovirus family to which the Ebola virus also belongs.\n\nIt takes its name from the German city of Marburg where it was first identified in a lab where workers had been in contact with infected green monkeys that had been imported from Uganda.",

          "text": "Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has reaffirmed his stand against blanket amnesty for repentant Boko Haram fighters.\n\nA few days ago, the Nigerian Army released a statement, saying the recent escalation of offensive operations by troops of operation HADIN KAI have led Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province terrorists in the North-East to surrender en masse, a report which stirred various reactions as to what becomes of the \u2018repentant\u2019 terrorists.\n\nSpeaking on the development as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, Senator Ndume noted that this did not come to him as a surprise. He, however, was of the opinion that more must be done to the insurgents other than the pat on the back which seems to be the norm at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t come to me as a surprise actually, because I\u2019ve been saying for a long time that the armed forces and other security agencies of the country are handicapped, otherwise, they have the capacity and the ability to prosecute this war.\n\n\u201cNow that what they need is given to them, you can see the results within this short time. And I\u2019m expecting more.\n\n\u201cIt is only that, as I have said before, there shouldn\u2019t be blanket amnesty and pampering treatment to those who have surrendered,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nREAD ALSO: More Boko Haram Members Surrender In Borno, Beg For Forgiveness\n\nAccording to him, what needs to be done now is to ensure that the seemingly contrite insurgents are carefully profiled without any rush to have them return back to the community.\n\nThe legislator is of the opinion that the army should be more focused on ensuring that the Boko Haram war is brought to an end even faster than it has been predicted in various quarters.\n\nNdume went on to state that as the war draws to a denouement, what the nation must begin to turn its attention to should be the resettlement of those who have been displaced over time.\n\nFor him, it is after the citizens who bore the brunt of this conflict have been satisfactorily resettled, that the nation can begin to talk about how to reintegrate those who have wreaked havoc on the nation and are now pleading for mercy.\n\n\u201cThe first step after getting them is the resettlement of people, now that the war is getting to an end or is almost ending. Then, we talk about profiling, investigating, and interrogating those that have surrendered.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker expressed confidence in the new leadership of the armed forces, emphasising that the well-coordinated inter-agency cooperation between the country\u2019s security agencies will yield favourable results for all.\n\n\u201cI think it is a welcome development and I have confidence that more is to be seen with the new leadership and the new cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cJust as we have been criticising the armed forces, that they are not doing enough, now that they are doing enough, and there is hope, and there is light at the end of the tunnel, there is a need for Nigerians to come out to support the military by encouraging them, and commending them for what they have done.\u201d",

There was also a partial internet restriction.\n\nLungu said election-day violence had killed two people \u2014 including the chairman of his party in North-Western province.\n\nIn a statement, he said he had directed the army commander \u201cto quickly re-enforce security in North-Western, some parts of Western, and Southern provinces where this unprecedented violence is taking place\u201d.\n\n\u201cI will not take kindly to these evil schemes,\u201d he vowed. \u201cHow can you talk about free and fair elections when our opponents have taken this election as war?\u201d he said.\n\nThe troop deployment was just a \u201cdistraction\u201d, opposition United Party for National Development spokesman Anthony Bwalya told AFP.\n\nSixteen candidates were vying for the top job, but the frontrunners are Lungu, 64, and business tycoon Hichilema, who are facing off at the polls for the third time and who between the two of them garnered almost 98 per cent of the votes in the 2016 election.\n\nIt is Hichilema\u2019s sixth attempt at the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that we will carry the day,\u201d he said after voting at a secondary school in a leafy suburb of Lusaka. \u201cPeople want change \u2014 you can see it in their faces,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAddressing opposition fears of fraud, Hichilema said Zambia\u2019s next leader \u201cmust be determined by the\u2026 voters, not the people who count the votes\u201d.\n\nA flagging economy and rising living costs have eroded Lungu\u2019s support base in recent years, surveys suggest.\n\nLungu is accused of borrowing unsustainably, particularly from Chinese creditors, to finance a spree of infrastructure projects.\n\nUnder his administration, Zambia became the first African country to default on its sovereign debt since the coronavirus pandemic began, while inflation soared to more than 20 per cent.\n\nLungu\u2019s critics point to poverty and joblessness in the midst of glittering infrastructure.\n\nAround seven million citizens were eligible to vote for a president, legislators and local government representatives.\n\nThe winning candidate must acquire more than 50 per cent of votes to avoid a second-round runoff. Official results were expected by Sunday.",

Turner said she had been told that the man, who was dressed in black and grey, was armed with a semi-automatic weapon.\n\nAfter the attack, the gunman escaped through a park behind the house and shot two dog walkers, The Times reported.\n\n\u201cThe incident in Plymouth is shocking and my thoughts are with those affected,\u201d Home Secretary Priti Patel said on Twitter.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police said they were called to the Keyham area of the city at 6.10 p.m. on Thursday.\n\n\u201cInvestigations are continuing into the incident and disruption to the road network in the Keyham area will remain throughout the night,\u201d the police said.\n\nThe South Western Ambulance Service earlier said it had responded to the incident with a significant number of resources, including Hazardous Area Response Teams (HART), multiple ambulances, air ambulances, multiple doctors and senior paramedics.",
