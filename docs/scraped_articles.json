          "title": "Our members under attack in Ebonyi, PDP Cries",
          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party has raised the alarm that its members in the Ebonyi State Chapter of the party are being attacked, harassed and killed.\n\nThe party stated that those behind the atrocities are sponsored by agents of the state government.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement titled \u2018PDP Alerts of Attack, Killing, Labelling of Its Members in Ebonyi State,\u2019\n\nsigned by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Thursday.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe attention of the PDP has been drawn to the harassment, intimidation and unfounded criminal allegations against our members and stakeholders in the Ebonyi State Chapter of our party.\n\n\u201cDuring a recent courtesy call on the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Dave Umahi in Abakaliki by the Police Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Zone 9, Mr. Okon, the governor openly and without any investigation, criminally accused prominent leaders of our party, including, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, Senator Sam Egwu, Chief Ali Odefa, Hon. Linus Okorie among others as sponsors of banditry and violence in the State.\n\n\u201cIt is already common knowledge that agents of the Governor Umahi-led administration had gathered known cultists and thugs and armed them with dangerous weapons including pump action riffles to be unleashed on innocent citizens, particularly members of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThese agents of APC government in Ebonyi State have also resorted to using the thugs to disrupt the meetings of our party as well as foist a reign of terror in the state, wherein thugs have taken over the streets and openly extort money from helpless motorists.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, a member of our Party, Barr. Amos Ogbonnaya, who refused to join Governor Umahi to the APC was abducted and later released with life threatening injuries after much public outcry. He is still in the intensive care unit of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThough Ogbonnaya recognized his abductors as state government agents, and reported to the Police and DSS, no arrests have been made to bring the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cAlso, on the 30th of November 2020 one of our members, Mr. Shedrack Nwode, a native of Umuezoka, along with his fianc\u00e9e were shot dead by thugs suspected to be working for the APC, for refusing to chant \u2018APC, Change\u2019 at a traditional wedding ceremony.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on Friday, 4th of December 2020, three prominent supporters of PDP from Ugwulangwu in Governor Umahi\u2019s own LGA were arrested on trump-up charges of being cultists.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, Chief Henry C. Udeh (Ajim Best), from Okposi in Ohaozara LGA was brutally attacked for daring to hold PDP meeting in his own house, and many valuables, including vehicles were destroyed.\n\n\u201cJust now, we received a report that a member of our party, Prince Anyigor Methuselah KS, of Ezza North has been abducted and is reportedly being kept at the Cabinet Office of the old government house in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cOur party further alerts Nigerians of Governor Umahi\u2019s resort to labelling opposition voices in the state as cultists and terrorist elements as a ploy to victimize members of our party as well as incite federal security agencies against our leaders.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi\u2019s suppressive government is now sealing off homes and businesses of PDP members, all in a bid to cow and silence them.\n\n\u201cA hotel belonging to former Governor Sam Egwu has been sealed up while a private school belonging to another member of the PDP, Barr. Friday Agbom, was also sealed on trumped up charges.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we are worried over the vexatious disposition of Governor Umahi towards the opposition, dissenting voices and other innocent citizens in the state; a development that has heightened security concerns and capable of triggering a huge crisis that can destabilize the state.\n\n\u201cThe action of the APC-led government has also foisted a reign of terror in the state, crippled economic activities and brought untold hardship to the people.\n\n\u201cSince Governor Umahi realized that he is alone in his political voyage in the APC, he has been in distress, having been left in the cold and as such seeks to decimate the opposition and disrupt peaceful coexistence in the state.\n\n\u201cOur party counsels Governor Umahi to have only himself to blame for his self-inflicted political woes, instead seeking to drag down and destroy the entire state because of his botched political ambition.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also cautions Governor Umahi to note that the people of Ebonyi state can never be intimidated or cowed by the APC\n\nand its external backers, who are looking for every means to cause mayhem and ruin the state for their political gains.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on all our members in Ebonyi to remain calm even as we caution Governor Umahi to note that human history has always shown that there is a limit to which a people can bear in the face of open aggression and intimidation.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative for the Inspector General of Police as well as the military high command to note the antics of the Umahi-led administration in the state and take urgent steps to protect the innocent citizens so as to save the state from imminent collapse.\u201d",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Rotimi Ojomoyela\n\nEKITI\u2014VICE-Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, NGF, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, yesterday, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of overreaching himself on the Executive Order 10 that canvassed judicial and legislative autonomies for states.\n\nTambuwal, who is the governor of Sokoto State, noted that the NGF expected President Buhari to have consulted widely before issuing the order, saying exercising such powers unilaterally was tantamount to illegality.\n\nHe spoke during an Attorney-General\u2019s Colloquium, organised by the Ekiti State Ministry of Justice Academy in honour of the retiring Chief Judge of the state, Justice Ayodeji Daramola.\n\nSpeaking on the topic \u2018The Judicial Autonomy: Perspective of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum\u2019, Tambuwal said Buhari was ill-advised in issuing the order that craved judicial autonomy for states, adding that such illegal voyage undermined the powers of the governors.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs Governors of the 36 states on the platform of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, let me state very clearly that we are unequivocally committed to the autonomy of the judiciary and the legislature.\n\n\u201cThe recent misunderstanding on the financial autonomy of the Judiciary is predicated on the need to establish an implementation framework to the 4th Alteration of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Section 121(3). What we have questioned, and we have made this known at every opportunity, is the process of implementing this provision of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we will be failing in our responsibility if we refuse to draw the attention of the President, stakeholders and the country to grave concerns about the constitutionality of Executive Order 10 of 2020. That was the basis of the position that we took on Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order 10 ostensibly intended to support the implementation of judicial financial autonomy, was completely unnecessary and ill-advised. Let me at this juncture state clearly that we never questioned the right of Mr. President to issue Executive Orders. We only stated that Section 121(3) did not require Presidential Executive Fiat to become implementable.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across states, including the enactment of a Fund Management Law, which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of the constitution.\n\n\u201cBudgetary releases to the judiciary will be pro-rated based on the actual revenues recorded each month by the State government.\u201d\n\nAlso lending his voice, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State stated that the issue of judicial and legislative autonomies is advantageous, noting that governors also have limitations based on constitutional provisions.\n\nFayemi said: \u201cWho is to take capital spending for the judiciary and legislature has always been the controversy.\n\nThe governors will continue to hold our judiciary with reverence because I know that this democracy will not endure if we subject our judiciary to the jackboots of the executive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no questioning the fact that we can do a lot more for our judiciary to make it truly independent.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

However, there were those who contended that the amendment exercise is a fruitless venture, arguing that the country needs a new constitution instead.\n\nFG carrying much load, let states decide their LG model \u2013 El-Rufus\n\nGovernor el-Rufai said each state of the federation should decide the model of local government that best suited it\n\nAccording to him, listing the 774 Local Governments in the constitution and trying to establish for them direct relations with the Federal Government violate the spirit of federalism.\n\nThe governor, who spoke at the public hearing of the senate committee on the review of the1999 constitution in Kaduna, said each state should decide how many local governments it can efficiently run and fund for better governance and delivery of public goods.\n\nHe argued that devolution of powers is necessary because the current structure overburdens the federal government with too many responsibilities which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nThe governor further said that the APC Committee on True Federalism which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly can more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nThe governor, who spoke in his personal capacity, proposed 10 items that should be shared responsibilities between the state and federal governments.\n\nThese include strengthening military and security agencies; decentralizing the police to enable the states exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities; need for federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\nEl Rufai also said that the constitution should be altered to remove the Police Service Commission because it is an unnecessary hindrance to effective policing in Nigeria and \u2018\u2019the power to hire and fire police officers should revert fully and totally to the Inspector General of Police, under the supervision of the National Police Council, as envisaged by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe governor recommended that all \u2018\u2019mineral resources, including oil and gas and solid minerals, in the states, which will in turn pay royalties and taxes to the Federation Account.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u2019States already control land within their territories, courtesy of the Land Use Act, which is incorporated into the Constitution by reference,\u201d he argued.\n\nIn his remarks on the occasion,Senator Uba Sani representing Kaduna Central, said the zonal public hearing was to expand and deepen the people\u2019s participation in the constitutional reform process. He said when the people are fully involved, they will own the process, legitimise it, and defend its outcome.\n\nEarlier in his address,Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review,Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, said those who have followed previous Constitutional Review exercises, may be wondering why these Zonal Hearings are coming ahead of the National Public Hearing.\n\n\u201cThe reason is not farfetched; the Senate has decided to adopt a bottom-top approach by first listening to Nigerians at the geo-political level. This approach underscores the critical importance the Constitution Review Committee places on the subnational levels of governance in Nigeria. Surely, and without a doubt, the success of the Committee\u2019s review process will be dependent on your beneficent support and partnership.\u2019\u2019\n\nWe must review the 1999 Nigerian constitution now \u2014 Dep Senate President\n\nSenator Ovie Omo-Agege said the review of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution as amended will help adjust the lapses and holes in it, saying that there is need to give every segment of the society a sense of belonging in the scheme of affairs in the country.\n\nOmo-Agege, who was represented by Senator Abubakar Kyari, in Bauchi at the opening ceremony of the North-East Zonal sitting of the committee said that the constitutional review in the country must be in tandem with democratic tenets as practiced in developed countries, noting that it takes time to review due to the fact that it has to undergo a lot of processes that must be in line with democratic settings.\n\nIn his address, Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed who welcomed the review of the constitution said it will go a long way in capturing the yearnings and aspirations of Nigerians.\n\nDeclaring the public hearing open, the governor said he supports the review of the 1999 constitution in the areas of federal structure, governance, power devolution, establishment of state police, states and local governments creation, and constitutional roles for traditional rulers among others.\n\nIgbo need justice, equity not secession\n\n\u2014 Uzodimma\n\nImo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, speaking in Owerri, at the opening ceremony of the National Assembly Constitutional Review Committee Public Hearing for the South-East zone chaired by Senator, Orji Uzor Kalu, said that the Igbo people needed a constitution review that would give them justice and equity and not secession.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cFor us as true leaders, genuinely committed to the Igbo question, the question agitating our minds is. What exactly do Igbo seek from Nigeria? Without sounding simplistic, what we seek is justice and equity. When we talk of restructuring or devolution of power, we are talking actually of having an environment created for us to unleash our potential and talent without let or hindrance.\n\nWe are also talking of being treated equally like every other part of Nigeria. More importantly, we are talking of being part of the decision-making process in Nigeria. It means we are not talking of domination or secession.\u201d\n\nWe need Aba, Adada states in Southeast \u2014 Aba Movement leadership.\n\nIn another development, the leadership of Aba State Movement, led by Elder Emmanuel Adaelu, said among other things that the constitution review committee should consider the report of the committee on state creation of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo under Chief John Nnia Nwodo.\n\n\u201cThe Committee should consider the merit for the creation of Aba and Adada states respectively. Aba State Movement stood by the Ohanaeze Committee recommendation since all groups agitating for a State in the South East fully participated in the Committee\u2019s work by making presentations to it,\u2019\u2019 it said.\n\nChief Theo Nkire, first Attorney-General of Abia State, made Aba State Movement\u2019s presentation to the Senate Committee on constitutional review chaired by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nWhy current exercise must succeed\n\n\u2014 Ekweremadu\n\nThe Enugu centre, which hosted Anambra, Enugu and Ebonyi states, was chaired Senator Ike Ekweremadu.\n\nAmong the groups that made submissions is the Judaism Fellowship Initiate, demanding that Saturdays be legally recognized in the Constitution as their worship day like other worship days.\n\nAlso, the Ebonyi State Commissioner for Information, Uchenna Orji, explained that delegates from Ebonyi to the zonal public hearing would articulate concerns of the state and make their presentations during the sitting.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on the sideline of the meeting, Senator Ike Ekweremadu stressed the need for decentralization of the police system to solve rising insecurity in the country\n\nHe lamented that the last constitution review touched all aspects of what is happening today but was not given attention or implemented.\n\nSpeaking on the topical issue of open grazing, he noted that it was land related and the duty of state governor to allow or not to allow open grazing.\n\nHis words: \u201cYou are fair to say that the one we had is like a fruitless exercise. On our part as parliamentarians, we did our part; we were able to break the jinx of constitutional amendment starting from 2010. And from then till now we had about four scenarios.\n\nWe have a lot of those who have been passed and consented to by the houses of Assembly and Assented to by the President and there are others we passed and concurred by the houses of Assembly and refused assent by the President.\n\n\u2018\u2019We discussed the issue of local government reform, including the issue of decentralization of power. The problem is not our own. We made effort but there were unforeseen circumstances. I just hope that those behind the failure will allow this one to succeed.\u2019\u2019\n\nOther senators in attendance include Chukwuka Utazi, Ifeanyi Uba, Sam Egwu, Obinna Ogba, and Uche Ekwunife.\n\nWe support constitution amendments that will enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity, prosperity\n\n\u2013 Ugwuanyi\n\nAlso speaking, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has declared his administration\u2019s support for amendments in the constitution of Nigeria that will enhance the nation\u2019s unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail.\u201d\n\nThe governor who harped on the importance of unity and prosperity in an atmosphere of justice, fairness and equity, therefore enjoined all relevant Institutions, Civil Society Organizations, Stakeholders and entire Enugu State citizenry to avail themselves the opportunity of the zonal public hearing to participate in the national conversation.\n\nSanwo-Olu, speaker, demand fiscal federalism, state police, special status for Lagos\n\nIn Lagos, participants, consisting labour unions, human rights activists, civil society groups, among others have called for total amendment of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria and restructuring to reflect true federalism for unity, progress and prosperity of the country.\n\nAlso, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Speaker, of the state House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, reiterated the need for a special economic status for Lagos, creation of state police and true fiscal federalism\n\nThe governor, as host, Obasa, and other participants made the call, at the opening of the two-day Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution, South West, Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Zonal Public Hearing, Lagos Center, held in Ikeja, under the chairmanship of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, representing Lagos Central.\n\nTop on the agenda presented was the need for total devolution of powers whereby the local government system has the greater share and so is empowered to carry out effective administration of the polity since it is closest to the people.\n\nOther submissions from participants cut across the creation of new states, local governments autonomy, gender equality, and the drafting of an entirely new Constitution as they described the current one as \u201cMilitary Constitution\u201d imposed on Nigerians.\n\nParticipants also called for creation of state police, re-inclusion of Magistrates in the constitution, review of the retirement age of Magistrates from 60 to 65 years.\n\nThe roll call of other senators in attendance include: Olamilekan Adeola (Lagos West), Tokunbo Abiru (Lagos East); Senators Ibikunle Amosun, Tolu Odebiyi (Ogun State); Senators Teslim Folarin and Abdulfatai Buhari (Oyo State), among others.\n\nPresident of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, comrade Ayuba Wabba, Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, and representatives of civil organizations, associations, towns, communities, across the states, professional bodies, among others presented and submitted their individual memorandum to the the committee.\n\nThe governor, in his address, commended the leadership and members of the National Assembly for responding to the concerns of Nigerians on the need to carry out a review of the 1999 Constitution to reflect current realities.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of State Police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority list for us, in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a Special Economic Status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited land mass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this Special Status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me at this point to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nNigeria needs new Constitution, not amendment- Okowa\n\nIn Asaba, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, said what Nigeria needed is a new Constitution not amendment.\n\nOkowa, who spoke when he received on courtesy visit, the Senate Sub-Committee on review of the 1999 Constitution led by Senator James Manager in Asaba, said a new Constitution for the country had become imperative in view of observed lacuna in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nWhile calling for the insertion of a clause to allow for the re-writing of the Constitution while it would continue to be in operation until a new one was ready, he said: \u201cthere is no doubt that there is still a lot to work to be done on our Constitution to have a near perfect document, and I know that the National Assembly has continued over time, to cause some of the amendments to be.\u2019\u2019\n\nAt the sitting, which drew participants from Delta, Bayelsa and Edo states, contentious issues of devolution of power, review of revenue formula, state police, local government autonomy and state creation dominated the zonal public hearing.\n\nOkowa who was represented by the Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Chief Sheriff Oborevwori, said the nation should continue as a federation but with proper federal structure.\n\nParticipants at the public hearing including politicians, civil society groups, women group, youth body, community stakeholders, unions among others, across the three state presented their memoranda on various subjects to the secretariat of the committee.\n\nConstitution review: Owie advocates devolution of powers\n\nFormer Chief Whip of the Senate, Roland Owie, called for the practice of true federalism with proper devolution of powers.\n\nIn his recommendation to the Committee through the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, Owie said it is not in dispute that federalism is the best for Nigeria but the way to go about it remains the challenge.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Constitution has two Legislative Lists, namely, Exclusive and Concurrent. These lists have 98 items of power. The Federal Government exercises exclusive power over 68 items on the Exclusive List.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the states, in concurrence with the Federal Government, exercise power over 30 items on the Concurrent List, while the States exercise power on the concurrent list, only if the Federal Government has not already \u201ccovered the field\u201d on any of the 30 items.\n\n\u201cIn effect, State Governments really have no power to regulate their affairs. I wish to recommend that to resolve this, a holistic review of the 98 items in the Exclusive Legislative List and assign what is best to the Federal and what is best to the States, based on the principle of subsidiarity.\u201d\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu, ABUJA\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, yesterday, raised the alarm over alleged killings of its members in Ebonyi state.\n\nThe main opposition party also said some of its members and leaders in the state were being harassed and accused of phoney criminal acts by the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government in the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the party\u2019s secretariat, Abuja, national publicity secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan said Governor Dave Umahi has been firm in his consistent intimidation of PDP leaders in Ebonyi, for simply refusing to defect with him to the APC.\n\n\u201cOn the 30th of November 2020, one of our members, Mr Shedrack Nwode, a native of Umuezoka, along with his fianc\u00e9e were shot dead by thugs suspected to be working for the APC, for refusing to chant \u2018APC, Change\u2019 at a traditional wedding ceremony.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on Friday, 4th of December 2020, three prominent supporters of PDP from Ugwulangwu in Governor Umahi\u2019s own Local Government Area, was arrested on trump-up charges of being cultists.\n\n\u201cDuring a recent courtesy call on the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. Dave Umahi in Abakaliki by the Police Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Zone 9, Mr Okon, the governor openly and without any investigation, criminally accused prominent leaders of our party, including, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, Senator Sam Egwu, Chief Ali Odefa, Hon. Linus Okorie among others sponsors of banditry and violence in the State.\n\n\u201cIt is already common knowledge that agents of the Governor Umahi-led administration had gathered known cultists and thugs and armed them with dangerous weapons including pump-action riffles to be unleashed on innocent citizens, particularly members of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThese agents of APC government in Ebonyi State have also resorted to using the thugs to disrupt the meetings of our party as well as foist a reign of terror in the state, wherein thugs have taken over the streets and openly extort money from helpless motorists.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, a member of our Party, Barr. Amos Ogbonnaya, who refused to join Governor Umahi to the APC was abducted and later released with life-threatening injuries after much public outcry. He is still in the intensive care unit of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThough Ogbonnaya recognized his abductors as state government agents, and reported to the Police and the Department of State Services, DSS, no arrests have been made to bring the perpetrators to book,\u201d Ologbondiyan said.\n\nAccording to the publicity scribe, Chief Henry C. Udeh (Ajim Best), from Okposi in Ohaozara Local Government Area \u201cwas brutally attacked for daring to hold PDP meeting in his own house, and many valuables, including vehicles were destroyed.\u201d\n\nHe also said the party was in receipt of a report that a PDP member, Prince Anyigor Methuselah of Ezza North \u201chas been abducted and is reportedly being kept at the Cabinet Office of the old government house in Ebonyi state.\u201d\n\nAlso read:\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur party further alerts Nigerians of Governor Umahi\u2019s resort to labelling opposition voices in the state as cultists and terrorist elements as a ploy to victimize members of our party as well as incite federal security agencies against our leaders.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi\u2019s suppressive government is now sealing off homes and businesses of PDP members, all in a bid to cow and silence them.\n\n\u201cA hotel belonging to former Governor Sam Egwu has been sealed up while a private school belonging to another member of the PDP, Barr. Friday Agbom was also sealed on trumped-up charges.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we are worried over the vexatious disposition of Governor Umahi towards the opposition, dissenting voices and other innocent citizens in the state; a development that has heightened security concerns and capable of triggering a huge crisis that can destabilize the state.\n\n\u201cThe action of the APC-led government has also foisted a reign of terror in the state, crippled economic activities and brought untold hardship to the people.\n\n\u201cSince Governor Umahi realized that he is alone in his political voyage in the APC, he has been in distress, having been left in the cold and as such seeks to decimate the opposition and disrupt peaceful coexistence in the state.\n\n\u201cOur party counsels Governor Umahi to have only himself to blame for his self-inflicted political woes, instead of seeking to drag down and destroy the entire state because of his botched political ambition.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also cautions Governor Umahi to note that the people of Ebonyi state can never be intimidated or cowed by the APC and its external backers, who are looking for every means to cause mayhem and ruin the state for their political gains.\n\n\u201cOur party calls on all our members in Ebonyi to remain calm even as we caution Governor Umahi to note that human history has always shown that there is a limit to which a people can bear in the face of open aggression and intimidation.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative for the Inspector General of Police as well as the military high command to note the antics of the Umahi-led administration in the state and take urgent steps to protect the innocent citizens so as to save the state from imminent collapse.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, PDP national vice-chairman (South-East), Ali Odefa said Governor Umahi, having realized that highly-placed party members failed to defect with him, has resorted to cheap blackmail and intimidating tactics.\n\nHe challenged the governor to test his popularity on the ballot after his second term in office on the platform of the APC to prove to Nigerians his electoral mileage.\n\nPolitical affiliation, he noted, is a matter of choice, stressing that the people of Ebonyi state do not deserve to be punished for electing to remain in the PDP when the governor left for the ruling party.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

So I continue to insist that they should come forward to be profiled and empowered\u201d.\n\nUmahi also identified charm makers and sellers of hard drugs as some of the problems bedeviling the youths.\n\n\u201cWe need to identify those who are selling hard drugs. It is also another problem. Remove these two and our children are the best. You add these two, our children do not know who is who,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Governor also commended the efforts of the Chairmen of the four Local Governments that make up the Ebonyi Central Zone, he said: \u201cLet me thank my Local Government Chairmen on the issue of security. Some of you are doing extremely very well.\u201d\n\nHe frowned at the killing of security agencies and wondered why they should be killed when they are neither the problems of the agitation or the reasons the South East are being marginalized.\n\nUmahi also reiterated his commitment to see to the completion of the international airport project by December 2021, and equally promised to commence the dualization of the road that is going to cross Onueke before December also.",

          "text": "By Robert Egbe\n\nSenior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa on Thursday debunked a claim by a Special Adviser to Lagos Governor on Drainage Services, Joe Igbokwe that the Lagos State Judicial Panel has made a finding that nobody died from the Lekki Tollgate incident of October 20, 2020.\n\nAdegboruwa, a member of the panel, never made such a decision, because it was yet to even hear the whole testimonies of those involved.\n\nIgbokwe made the claim in a Facebook post and attributed it to the panel. He however deleted same following criticism.\n\nResponding to Igbokwe\u2019s post in a Facebook post of his own, the SAN described it as embarrassing.\n\nAdegboruwa said: \u201cI have just come across the Facebook post of Mr Joe Igbokwe, a member of the Lagos State Executive Council as Special Adviser to the Governor, to the extent that the Lagos Judicial Panel made a finding that nobody died from the Lekki Toll Gate Incidence of October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cI was thoroughly embarrassed as I was diminished, by the said post, coming as it were, from someone who should know better.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a member of the Lagos Judicial Panel. The Panel NEVER EVER said this. No such finding came from the Panel at all. As a matter of fact, the Panel has just opened the cases of EndSARS protesters, who have video evidence with which they hope to disprove the claims of the Nigerian Army that nobody was shot.\n\n\u201cSo, I truly don\u2019t know where Mr. Joe Igbokwe got his story from, but it\u2019s certainly not from the Panel of which I am a member.\n\n\u201cWe are even yet to take evidence from the Lagos State Government, from the Chief Pathologist, we are yet to conclude the testimonies of the hospitals where it was alleged that people with gunshot wounds were treated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo, how on earth can we conclude as a Panel that people died or people did not die when we are yet to hear the whole testimonies of those involved?\n\n\u201cI do humbly appeal to all Nigerians to disregard the statement from Mr. Joe Igbokwe which had no verifiable source. Members of the Panel are people with proven integrity and I can assure all Nigerians and indeed the entire world, that our findings will be based on truth; if people were killed at Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020, we will say so loud and clear and heavens will not fall, but if otherwise, we will also say so, clearly.\n\n\u201cGod bless Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFollowing outrage on social media over his post, Igbokwe made another post claiming his page had been hacked.\n\nThe Lagos State Judicial Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS related abuses and the Lekki Tollgate Incident resumes sitting Friday.",

          "text": "Our Reporter\n\nAs the race for the seat of power in Anambra State gathers more steam, leading aspirant under the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), Paul Orajiaka has reeled out more details of how he plans to tackle the key issues of employment in the state.\n\nIn his earlier address to residents of the state, Orajiaka had revealed his plan to solve the problem of insecurity, health and electricity in the state through his Security, Health, Electricity, Employment, Education and Road, SHEEER, agenda.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday on how he intends to create jobs for the teaming unemployed youth population in the state, Orajiaka said his approach would be to create an enabling environment for both the public and private sector to thrive noting that a strong collaboration is required between the government and private sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is assumed that the private sector is better at identifying business problems and opportunities than are governments. Such collaboration will reduce the information asymmetry between the public and private sectors as they exchange information frequently for the greater good of the state.\n\n\u201cAnambra like every other state of the federation has three senatorial districts but what makes Anambra special is that her three senatorial districts have distinct comparative advantages unlike most other states. So, our plan will be to focus and enhance the potential in each senatorial zone looking at mechanized agriculture in the north, information technology in the central and industrialisation in the south of the state.\n\n\u201cOur plan will be to develop an ecosystem to support the growth of the potential of each senatorial district and build a short, medium and long term developmental focus for the State to align the agricultural belt, the information technology and the industrial zone of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOn the agricultural belt, we will create access to market for the farm produce, encourage mechanization, improve storage facilities and setting up a community board that will be commercially run and saddled with the responsibility for buying the produce from the farmers and granting them access to not just local market but as well as open them up to foreign markets. An independent fund to co-invest with private equity funds will be launched to encourage promising local farmers to mechanize their operation supply chain management.\n\n\u201cOn the IT zone our plans will be to develop incubation centres, with fast broadband connection, social facilities, financing and tax breaks for reputable IT companies willing to establish an operational base in the state. We will establish an IT development seed funding program in conjunction with established venture capital firms to match investments from foreign venture capital firms with Anambra technology startups.\n\n\u201cOn the technical belt, I understand that there already exist clusters of small firms undertaking significant technical development in the State. However, key challenges such as funding, basic amenities, access to markets and access to modern technology and information, has not allowed them to achieve their full potential.\n\n\u201cTo tackle the funding challenge, we plan the establishment of a funding process in conjunction with several banks where our government will provide guarantees to the Bank to facilitate the funding at lower rates. Establishment of a technical institute will be amongst our plans in the zone to train the labour for the factories and disseminate modern information to firms. Ultimately, we will partner with established companies with significant skill sets in relevant industries to set up bases in the Anambra and pair them with local firms.\n\n\u201cAnambra State unemployment statistics is presently not the best. We can do better. Government cannot employ everyone so my approach would be to create a conducive environment for the private sector to thrive. The ease of doing business in the state is very poor, so we will dismantle all the obstacles that hamper private investors and investments from thriving in the state. Ndi Anambra are naturally talented entrepreneurs, and this calls for the need to unveil all incentives to encourage business owners in the state so the significant potential of the state can be unlocked.\u201d",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure; Noah Ebije, Kaduna; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Lukman Olabiyi; Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto; Sola Ojo, Kaduna; Stanley Uzoaru, George Onyejiuwa Owerri and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Senate Committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution (As Amended) began public hearing yesterday, in the various geo-political zones across the country, with renewed clamour for creation of additional state in the South East, state police and power devolution among other demands listed by the State governors and other stakeholders.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai and his Delta and Plateau counterparts, Ifeanyi Okowa and Simon Lalong, respectively, top the list of governors calling for power devolution and true federalism\n\nEl Rufai argued that devolution of powers is necessary because the current structure overburdens the federal government with too many responsibilities which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nThe governor further recalled that the APC Committee on True Federalism, which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly can more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\n\u201cThe power to hire and fire police officers should revert fully and totally to the Inspector General of Police, under the supervision of the National Police Council, as envisaged by the Constitution.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Asaba, Delta state capital, which hosted the public hearing Delta, Bayels and Edo states, Over Ifeanyi Okowa said there should be \u201cacceptable and legitimate division of powers among different tiers of government; a written constitution delineating such division; the coordinate supremacy of the levels of government with regard to their respective functions; and a considerable measure of autonomy \u2013 fiscal, legislative and judicial \u2013 of the Federal Government and the federating units.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who was represented by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori, advocated that revenues collected by the Federal Government through the parastatals of NNPC, NLNG, CBN, NIMASA, FAAN and other similar agencies should be remitted into the federation account.\n\n\u2022We want amendments that\u2019ll enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity, prosperity \u2013 Ugwuanyi\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi declared his administration\u2019s support for constitution amendments that will enhance the nation\u2019s unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail\u201d.\n\nThe governor enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and entire Enugu state citizenry to avail themselves the opportunity of the zonal public hearing to participate in the national conversation.\n\n\u201cI, particularly, acknowledge the leader of the team and Senator representing Enugu West Senatorial District in the 9th Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Distinguished Senator Prof. Ike Ekweremadu, CFR. I also recognise in a special way, Distinguished Senator, Chuka Utazi, who represents me and the people of Enugu North Senatorial District in the Red Chamber of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues from Enugu, Anambra and Ebonyi states, the Speaker of the Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi, assured the people of South East geo-political zone that the state legislature will first seek their opinions before adopting the outcome of the constitutional review by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Speaker, who maintained that constitution alteration is a continuous exercise, commended the 9th National Assembly for taking up the task again and thanked governor Ugwuanyi for providing the enabling atmosphere for the event.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, Senator Ekweremadu, also applauded governor Ugwuanyi, who he described as \u201cInsurance Guru\u201d, for his immense contributions towards the hosting of the zonal public hearing in Enugu.\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu pushes for special status for Lagos\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who declared the Lagos centre of the public hearing open, yesterday, demanded a special economic status for the state, saying the progress and prosperity of Nigeria is inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State.\n\nSanwo-Olu also demanded for a State Police and entrenchment of true fiscal federalism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of State Police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly, for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a Special Economic Status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited land mass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this Special Status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me, at this point, to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Constitution reference point of democracy \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nSokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, represented by his Deputy, Alhaji Muhammadu Manir Dan Iya, described the Constitution as the reference point of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in the 22 years of Nigeria\u2019s experience in government by representation, our gains have more than justified our challenges.\n\n\u201cAll constitutions are, therefore, work in progress, because they are subject to the changing needs and aspirations the people, at different times.\n\n\u201cAnd constitutional reviews are the processes for ensuring this guiding document plays that function.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu noted that, the exercise is coming at the time of Nigeria\u2019s life when more dialogue is in dire need.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportune time to, therefore, collectively brainstorm on how to discuss these issues, for the country to move forward in unison, by having a more robust constitution.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 Constitution outdated- Senator Uba Sani\n\nThe Senator representing Kaduna Central Zone, Uba Sani noted that the 1999 was outdated with some contentious issues that needed to be addressed, hence, the need to review it.\n\nSpeaking in Kaduna Sani noted that the Constitution was last reviewed 22 years ago which had brought crisis into governance.\n\n\u2022UN Women coalition advocates more in governance, inclusive language\n\nThe Coalition of Women Leaders in Kaduna State, in collaboration with UN Women advocated for an increase of women\u2019s rights, especially in political leadership, to enhance the participation of women in governance.\n\nThe coalition also called on the representatives of the committee currently meeting in Kaduna to be conscious of inclusive language as they amend the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u2022State police, additional states dominate S\u2019East constitution review\n\nThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution which kicked off in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday, was dominated by popular agitations for State policing and creation of another State in South East.\n\nChief of Staff to Abia State government, ACB Agbazuari, while submitting his memorandum, noted that State police will strengthen the peaceful coexistence in the southeast and check security challenges.\n\nHe urged members of the senate committee review to look into their submission in view of granting their request.\n\nSimilarly, Chief Theo Okire, who represented Aba Mass Movement, submitted that an additional states should be created in the South East.\n\nHe said if additional states are created in the South East, it would bring an even political atmosphere and less marginalisation of the zone.\n\nOther memoranda submitted were calls on gender equity, revenue allocation system, youth empowerment in politics, maintaining standards in professions in the country and accordance of constitutional roles to traditional institutions.\n\nGover Hope Uzodimma who also seized the opportunity to warn his detractors said: \u201cLet me, however, use this auspicious opportunity to tell these alarmists and pretenders to love of Ndigbo, that they are not more Igbo than I am and they do not love Igbo more than I do.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that while they want immediate and sentimental public applause, I want enduring prescriptions that can comprehensively address the Igbo challenge in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout sounding simplistic, what we seek is justice and equity. When we talk of restructuring or devolution of power, we are talking actually of having an environment created for us to unleash our potential and talent without let or hindrance.\n\n\u201cWe are also talking of being treated equally like every other part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u20221999 constitution amendment effort in futility, Babalola tells NASS\n\nLegal luminary Aare Afe Babalola (SAN) has charged the 9th National Assembly to, rather than waste time and resources at amending the 1999 constitution, convoke a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution.\n\nHe said the way out is to return the country to a parliamentary system of government and the 1963 structure.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 constitution to cure the inherent defects in the 1999 constitution. First, you cannot cure fraud. Second, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President. Or can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution? The fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become and Iroko tree which has branches. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound around the Presidential system of government. Why then is the National Assembly afraid of calling a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution and come up with a Parliamentary system of government as we had in 1963,\u201d he further said.\n\n\u2022N/Assembly\u2019ll provide a constitution that\u2019ll Nigeria challenges \u2013 Omo-Agege\n\nDeputy Senate President and Chairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege has expressed the determination of the National Assembly to provide Nigerians with a fair and inclusive constitution that will address the challenges of the nation.\n\n\u201cThe focus of this committee is how to manage the review exercise in a fair, inclusive, credible and transparent manner. At the commencement of this 9th Senate, we had set for ourselves a legislative agenda as a basis on which we are to be assessed. Sitting prominently in that agenda is the need to address , by way of constitutional amendments, topical issues like judicial and Electoral Reforms, Local Government Autonomy, and devolution of powers.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\u2022State police, additional states dominate S\u2019East constitution reviewThe public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution which kicked off in Owerri, Imo State, yesterday, was dominated by popular agitations for State policing and creation of another State in South East.\n\u201cThe truth is that there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 constitution to cure the inherent defects in the 1999 constitution.\nOr can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution?\nIt is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound around the Presidential system of government.",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nThe Nigerian Press Organisation (NPO) has charged the Federal Government to immediately take steps towards addressing the socio-economic, political and security challenges threatening the existence and unity of the country.\n\nThe body comprising Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), and Nigeria Union Of Journalists (NUJ) also condemned the high cost of governance, outrageous allowances and flamboyant lifestyles of political officers and appealed to politicians and state actors to minimise their inflammatory rhetorics to reduce tension and ease the growing sense of fear among Nigerians\n\nIt also called for the pruning of the excessive powers vested in the Federal Government. It said the country\u2019s resources hold innumerable economic and soft power advantages for the well being of the entire population if well managed.\n\nThese positions are contained in a communique jointly signed today by Kabiru A. Yusuf, President NPAN and President NPO; Mustapha Isa, President of NGE and Chris Isiguzo, President of NUJ after the end of its recent meeting in Abuja.\n\nThe NPO tasked the Federal Government to immediately implement the report of the Kaduna Governor, Mallam Nasir el\u2019Rufai-led committee report on true federalism and restructuring even as it also called for the implementation of the Steve Orosanye report on restructuring and rationalisation of Federal Government parastatals, commissions and agencies, which provides a veritable road map for arresting the unsustainable high cost of governance.\n\nThe El\u2019Rufai committee inaugurated in August 2017 by the Progressive Governors Forum, the umbrella body of governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket, submitted its report in January 2018,recommending the merger of states to boost their solvency, review of derivation, devolution of power, state police and other far-reaching adjustments to the structure of governance.\n\nSaid the NPO: \u201cA Federal system of government, particularly in a country like Nigeria which is an overbearing centre is counterproductive to the development of the centre itself and the component units. To leave the Federal Government with 68 items under the Exclusive Legislative List, including policing, is a recipe for unending destructive tension in the struggle for advantage among the federating units. It explains why our country is seemingly overwhelmed by non-state actors engaged in criminality and separatist agitations.\u201d\n\nIt cautioned the Federal Government on the frequency at which it solicits foreign loan as it may spell doom in the future considering the dwindling relevance of crude oil, the country\u2019s major revenue earner in the world market.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to avoid the debt overhang inherent in excessive borrowing. We are aware that borrowing is good so long as such loans are deployed to funding enduring development projects, within the GDP ratio. However, the current borrowing in the face of the slide in the value of the country\u2019s number one revenue earner-oil remains worrisome,\u201d NPO said.\n\nIt called for the immediate passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill, (PIB) and asked the government to put pressure on the National Assembly to hasten action on the bill.\n\n\u201cThe Bill has gone into our history as the longest bill to ever go through legislative processes. It is of common knowledge that the petroleum industry has been long overdue for an overhaul and the passage of the bill will be a major boost. That the bill has stayed this long in the National Assembly militates against improved corporate governance in the oil sector.\u201d\n\nThe group lamented that Nigeria has been embroiled lately in profound socio-economic, political and security challenges that threaten its very existence as reflected in ethnic divisions and separatist agitations in the country, with growing fears that an implosion is imminent.\n\n\u201cToday, criminality \u2013 kidnapping for ransom, banditry, arson, killings \u2013 defines the everyday reality for a good number of our citizens.\u201d",

It offers another opportunity for us to continue to work hard for an acceptable constitution that will meet the aspirations of Nigerians in general. This also provides for us in the South East the opportunity to address those issues that have been bothering us in the recent past.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, represented by his Chief of Staff, ACB Agbazuere called for the devolution of powers, state and local government policing and fiscal federalism.\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu also advocated a review of the current revenue allocation formula and argued that the current system under the Nigerian Constitution is not beneficial to states.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe current revenue allocation formula allocates more funds to the Federal Government at the detriment of the states and local governments. Secondly, the system discourages striving for an increased Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). This is because most states wait for allocation from federation accounts without much effort at getting an increased level of IGR.\u201d\n\nOn gender equality, a civil society group, Women in Politics led by its President, Ebere Ifendu called for equal gender representation at the National Assembly.\n\nThe abolition of the State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC) was also clamoured for by the Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), represented by South East\u2019s union chairman, Nwaigwe Ikedin.\n\nOther amendments suggested by the group include establishment of local government police, alteration of the revenue allocation formula, abolition of joint account, funding of primary education from the federation account among others.",

The governor lamented that the people are losing confidence in the country because a number of issues have been allowed to fester for too long.\n\nWhile reiterating his unwavering commitment to the unity of the nation, Governor Akeredolu noted that issues of insecurity and true federalism have affected many things in the county, including the trust of the people.\n\n\u201cI kept making a case anytime I have the opportunity. My circumstance cannot make me believe in secession. My wife is from the South East. My sons married from other regions outside the South West. But strong points have been made. Everybody wants to see fairness and federalism. Those are the areas \u2013 is this how to run a federal government? Is it an inclusive one? How do we have fair representation? People are worried. This constitution review, your efforts, I pray it should be accepted. Our people believe that there must be dialogue.

Ephraim Ikeakor has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to be transparent and take full charge of Nigeria and address the current insecurity ravaging the country or resign.\n\nHe also absolved the people of South East and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of any involvement in the security challenges, especially burning of police stations and killing of security agents in region, alleging d that mercenaries might have been hired from outside to destabilise peace of the zone.\n\nIkeakor made the comments while addressing journalists in a pre-synod press conference held at St Andrew\u2019s Anglican Church Ebenato, Nnewi South Local Government Area of the State. The cleric insisted that Nigerians would want to know who between the President and the Presidency was in charge of the affairs of the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the crossroads; security has collapsed, education has collapsed, medical health system is in shambles. It is not only shameful, but also extremely embarrassing that our leaders, including Mr President still travel overseas to seek medical care. Why can\u2019t they fix our hospitals like what they see and use overseas.\n\n\u201cThe President, if he is still there, because we are confused on who is in charge, we do not know if the country is ruled by the President or the Presidency.

          "text": "\u2022Akeredolu seeks return to 1963 constitution\n\n\u2022Okowa demands new document, not amendment\n\n\u2022Lagos wants special status\n\n\u2022NLC, NULGE seek retention of minimum wage, LG autonomy\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe process for reviewing the 1999 Constitution as altered gathered momentum yesterday with clamours for creation of state police, devolution of powers to the states, creation of more states, restructuring and fiscal federalism featuring prominently in presentations made by stakeholders at zonal public hearings in 12 venues nationwide.\n\nThe two-day public hearings are being organised by the Senate Committee on Constitution Review.\n\nHowever, while the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, advocated a return to 1963 Constitution, his counterpart in Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, called for a new constitution and not an amendment of the 1999 document.\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, canvassed a special status for the state, which hitherto hosted the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also submitted a 72-page document, seeking the retention of the minimum wage, among other demands, while local government workers under the aegis of the Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) asked the lawmakers to make local governments autonomous.\n\nUnder the exercise, each of the six geopolitical zones was assigned two venues each to enable groups and individuals to present their demands.\n\nThe venues are Enugu and Owerri for the South-east; Lagos and Akure for South-west, Kaduna and Sokoto for North-west, Bauchi and Gombe for North-east, Port Harcourt and Asaba for South-south, and Jos and Minna for the North-central.\n\nVarious groups from the four North-west states of Kaduna, Kano, Katsina and Jigawa attended the public hearing at the Hassan Katsina House, Kawo in Kaduna.\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Kabiru Gaya, said the committee received a total of 24 memos from the four states, adding that more memos were being submitted.\n\nAmong the groups that presented memoranda were Jamiya Matan Arewa (JMA), the NLC, Civil Society Groups, Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Kaduna Elders Forum and Kano Progressives, among others.\n\nIn his remarks, the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, reiterated calls for devolution of powers.\n\nHe said the current structure overburdened the federal government with too many responsibilities, which it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nel-Rufai, who spoke in his personal capacity, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) Committee on true federalism which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly could more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nThe governor proposed 10 items which should be shared responsibilities between the federal governments and states.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe reality of our security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies. This includes decentralising the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\n\u201cWe need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor dismissed the fear of abuse of state police by sub-national governments because a constitutional or statutory framework can be enacted to ensure federal intervention in cases of such abuses.\n\nNLC and NULGE presentations were centred on the retention of minimum wage on the exclusive list, autonomy for local governments, gender issues and creation of additional local governments and states.\n\nIn its submission, Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), reechoed its long agitation for the creation of Gurara State out of the present Kaduna State.\n\nSOKAPU President, Mr. Jonathan Asake, demanded the amendment of section 8 of the constitution, which makes it almost an impossible task for the creation of a new state.\n\nAlso, the Kaduna Development Elders Initiatives, in its presentation, called for the amendment of the constitution to make it easy for the creation of states, especially the creation of a new Kaduna State.\n\nIn Owerri, where Imo and Abia States made their submissions, Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said the South-east\u2019s popular agitations and Nigeria\u2019s problems could be addressed by amending the constitution.\n\nIn a memorandum, he submitted for Abia State, the Chief of Staff to Abia State Governor, Mr. ACB. Agbazuari, said state police would strengthen the peaceful coexistence in the South-east and check security challenges.\n\nHe urged members of the Senate Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, to look into the state\u2019s submission with a view to granting their request.\n\nChief Theo Okire who represented Aba Mass Movement stated that additional states should be created in the South-east particularly, for Abia State to have Aba State.\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks at the occasion, Deputy Senate President and Chairman of the Senate Committee on 1999 Constitution Review, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, who was represented by Kalu, said at the beginning of the 9th Senate, the legislators had set a legislative agenda for themselves on which they would be assessed.\n\nKalu said he was aware that Ohanaeze Ndigbo, under the leadership of Prof George Obiozor, had articulated the position of the people of the South-east for the committee.\n\n\u201cWhat are the constitutional issues that agitate our minds: rotational presidency, state police, and indigeneship in a state after 10 years of residency, devolution of more powers to the states, resource control, and many more.\n\n\u201cAll these issues can be resolved through constitution amendments. This is the unique opportunity this public hearing offers to our people,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his contribution, Uzodimma stated that the Igbo are better off being part of the larger Nigeria with vast opportunities opened to them than being confined in a separate space with limited opportunities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn every part of Nigeria outside the South-east, we form the second largest population.\n\n\u201cAs an itinerant group, we move around to expand our economic frontiers. As citizens of Nigeria, we are afforded that lease of life. Our people are suffering harassment in South Africa and Ghana and other countries. Is that what we want to bequeath to our younger generation if, in hastily contrived indignation, we abandon our heritage in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cSo my dearest brothers and sisters, we need Nigeria just as Nigeria needs us. Whatever be our grievances against the system, we have a golden opportunity to seek redress under the upcoming constitutional review. What we seek is justice and equity for our people to thrive. And for that, we owe nobody any apology. But we cannot achieve it through violence or threat of secession. It is through an avenue like this that we put forward our request and follows it through.\u201d\n\nIn Lagos, the participants called for restructuring of the federation to reflect true federalism, saying only such a move would engender unity, progress and the prosperity of the country.\n\nThe state Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, reiterated the need for a special economic status for the state and the creation of state police. They also called for true fiscal federalism.\n\nParticipants from Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States made submissions to the Senate Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Oluremi Tinubu, representing Lagos Central.\n\nTop on the agenda of their presentations was the need for devolution of powers whereby the local government system has the greater share and so it is empowered to carry out effective administration of the polity since it is closest to the people.\n\nParticipants also called for the creation of state police, re-inclusion of magistrates in the constitution, review of the retirement age for magistrates from 60 to 65 years.\n\nThere were also calls for a declaration to make the Higher National Diploma (HND) equivalent to a university degree; need to ensure gender equality, judicial and electoral reforms, as well as revenue allocation, among others.\n\nPresident of the NLC, Mr. Ayuba Wabba, Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), and representatives of civil society organisations, associations and professional bodies, among others, presented and submitted their memoranda to the committee.\n\nSanwo-Olu Wants Special Status for Lagos\n\nIn his presentation, Sanwo-Olu said: \u201cFor us in Lagos State, the issues of state police and fiscal federalism are at the top of the priority list for us, in this ongoing review process. Equally fundamental, particularly for us in Lagos State, is the issue of a special economic status for Lagos, considering our place in the national economy and the special burdens we bear by virtue of our large population and limited landmass.\n\n\u201cI believe the need for this special status has been sufficiently articulated and justified. It suffices for me at this point to restate that this request is by no means a selfish one, but one that is actually in the interest of every Nigerian and of Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cThe progress and prosperity of Nigeria are inextricably linked to the progress and prosperity of Lagos State. A special status for Lagos State, therefore, must be a concern not only for the people of Lagos State alone but for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nObasa, who was represented by the Deputy Speaker, Wasiu Eshinlokun-Sanni, stated that the most fundamental aspect of the call by the state government is the 30 per cent derivation on natural resources for the domiciling states, as well as the criminalisation of undue interference in activities of the legislature by the executive.\n\nOnigbanjo, while presenting the Lagos memorandum, advocated an amendment to make the constitution reflects a federal system, among other prayers.\n\n\u201cWe also propose that the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act be repealed by the National Assembly because it prevents states from utilising the Sales Act to generate revenue and this has caused confusion and a lot of court cases. We also propose that appointment and promotion of judges should lie with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) of states and not the National Judicial Council (NJC),\u201d he added.\n\nState Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Revd, Steven Adegbite, queried the establishment and functionality of Sharia Courts since the constitution said there would be no state religion.\n\nHe said that CAN might be forced to vie for canon courts in the spirit of equity and justice.\n\nWabba, insisted that labour and the national minimum wage is retained on the exclusive legislative list.\n\nHe stated that since Nigeria has domesticated 26 of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which governs labour matters, \u2018it would be anomalous, incongruous and contemptible of global standards and order to even contemplate removing labour from the exclusive legislative list.\u201d\n\nIn Asaba, where submissions were received from Delta, Edo and Bayelsa States, true federalism, state police, devolution of power, state creation and gender parity dominated the demands.\n\nThe speakers of the legislatures of the three states presented the position papers of their respective states before the committee, which was chaired by Senator Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nOkowa Seeks New Constitution, Not Amendment\n\nOkowa, who declared the public hearing open, stated that Nigeria needs a new constitution.\n\nOkowa said what Nigeria actually needed was a \u201cnew constitution\u201d rather than a review.\n\nThe governor urged the National Assembly to look into power devolution to the states, review revenue allocation formula, oil derivation and demand for state police in the amendment to enable the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission to lay revenue allocation formula proposals directly before the lawmakers.\n\nBayelsa State also called for the devolution of power, state police and \u201ctrue federalism with 100 per cent resource control.\u201d\n\nEdo State delegation, led by Hon. Marcus Onobun, submitted proposals for about 30 alterations, including demands for state police, gender equality and true fedederalism.\n\nThe position paper for Delta State dwelt on demand for a 50 per cent derivation fund, a special ecological fund to mitigate the effects of oil and gas exploration as well as true federalism and state police with authority for states to purchase and control arms.\n\nDeclaring the event open in Minna, the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, said the North-central zone was not opposed to the restructuring of the country as being demanded by the South.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have problem with restructuring,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cat the end of the constitution review exercise, justice should be done to all segments of the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that \u201cNigeria is better and stronger as one country.\u201d\n\nFiscal federalism, devolution of powers to federating units, electoral reforms and state police also dominated presentations at the zonal hearing in Akure, the Ondo State capital, where submissions were received from Ondo, Ekiti and Osun States.\n\nAkeredolu Seeks Return to 1963 Constitution\n\nAkeredolu, set the ball rolling as he backed the call for the country to return to the 1963 Constitution, which gave powers to the regions to develop at their own pace.\n\nThe governor said the 1963 Constitution, which reflected the republican status of the country, remained the best document for a country as heterogeneous as Nigeria.\n\nAkeredolu stated that the powers of the federal government at the present must be trimmed as it was the major source of friction in the country.\n\nAkeredolu warned that the current attempt at constitution amendment should be taken beyond the usual jamboree conceived and executed to arrive at a predetermined result.\n\n\u201cThe current exercise, therefore, must not toe the path of the previous attempts at tokenism. The basic law of any country must not be reduced to frivolities reflecting preferred whimsies,\u201d he added.\n\nPresenting the position of Ekiti State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Akeem Jamiu, like Akeredolu, said the new constitution should allow only five political parties, allow independent candidate e-voting and diaspora voting.\n\nHe advocated a new revenue formula, which should be in favour of state and local government.\n\nJamiu also said states should be allowed to collect VAT and remit only five per cent to the federal government.\n\nHe also said that there should be state police.\n\nAt the North-east zonal hearing in Bauchi, Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, identified inadequacies in the constitution to cover revenue allocation, security provision and inclusiveness in running the affairs of the country.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the move would provide the change needed for the betterment of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the North-eastern part of the country as the most devastated by insurgency and educationally disadvantaged was shortchanged in the constitution, hence the need for the review.\n\nIn Gombe State, the state Governor, Senator Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya said the evolving dynamics of the Nigerian state made it imperative for a periodic constitution review in order to accommodate new realities and the concerns of the Nigerians.\n\nOn his part, Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, said citizens\u2019 participation in the ongoing constitution review would strengthen democracy.\n\nTambuwal, at the Sokoto venue of the North-west zonal hearing covering Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, described the constitution as a reference point of democracy.\n\nTambuwal was represented by his deputy, Muhammad Manir Dan\u2019Iya.\n\nOn his part, the Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, implored the stakeholders to deliberate and come up with what will generate more money for the states to enhance development.\n\nIn Enugu, devolution of power and creation of state police also topped discussions at the public hearing.\n\nChairman of the Enugu Zone and former Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, said this was not the first time the National Assembly was amending the constitution.\n\nHe stressed the need to decentralise the police for improved security and for local government reforms.\n\nAlso, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State expressed his support and that of the state to the constitution amendments, which he said would enhance Nigeria\u2019s unity and prosperity, especially \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail\u201d.\n\nIn Jos, the Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, expressed the hope that the constitution review would help in addressing the security challenges in the state and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cHopefully, this constitutional review should lead to better policing that is closer to the people to stop this kind of unacceptable murders,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said his administration had always advocated community policing as a viable tool in addressing the current security challenges in the country\n\nHe added: \u201cThat is why we have embraced community policing, which is a precursor to state police.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity as the Chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum to say that we have since set up committees on restructuring, the role of traditional rulers, engagement with the youth and even economic reforms of the region.\n\n\u201cThe reports of these committees will also be submitted to the Constitutional Review Committee for consideration.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022DPR targets to remit N900bn to FAAC in Q2\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has expressed interest in purchasing a 20 per cent minority equity stake in Dangote Refinery, Lagos, reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refining facility and the world\u2019s largest single-train plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce up to 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and 4 million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nNNPC Chief Operating Officer, Refining and Petrochemicals, Mr. Mustapha Yakubu, unfolded the investment plans yesterday at the end of a two-day Nigeria Oil and Gas Opportunity Fair (NOGOF), 2021, tagged: \u201cLeveraging Opportunities and Synergies for Post Pandemic Recovery of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry.\u201d\n\nHe spoke just as the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nYakubu said discussions were already ongoing with the Dangote Group for the acquisition of the stake.\n\nHe stated during the virtual event that the collaboration will further ensure undisrupted product supply to Nigerians when the deal materialises.\n\nHe added that one of its divisions, the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) was handling the negotiations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have what we call the green field refinery and the Greenfield Refining Projects Division (GRPD) of the NNPC. What we do, our strategy is to collaborate and seek strategic partnerships with private investors.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we have Dangote Refinery, which is the 650,000 capacity barrels per day plus a mini 80,000 tonnes per annum petrochemical plant.\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing there? I can tell you today that we are seeking to have a 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote Refinery as part of our collaboration and you know that there\u2019s a huge quantity of crude for that refinery.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 650,000 barrels, going into a single crude distillation unit (CDU).\n\nWhen that comes on board, it will also wet the nation for us.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the corporation is also interested in partnering with the African Refinery in Port Harcourt, a co-location facility, the CNCEC Chinese group, which is interested in building two refineries in Nigeria, the Waltersmith modular plant, in addition to collaborating with Azikel refineries on condensate production.\n\nYakubu stated that notwithstanding the global push for renewables, Nigeria has a local, domestic and regional market for hydrocarbons.\n\nHe added that Africa will continue to rely on fossil fuels at least in the next 20 years.\n\nHe said the country would not just fold its arms and do nothing with its hydrocarbons just because the International Energy Agency (IEA) has predicted a net-zero emissions scenario by 2050.\n\n\u201cToday, when you are bringing products into Nigeria, they disappear to neighbouring countries. There\u2019s nowhere in countries around Nigeria that they sell fuel for less than N400 per litre. So, there\u2019s a market,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the country\u2019s non-functional refineries, he said there was a deliberate effort to power the refineries down because of the need to do a full rehabilitation beyond the regular turnaround maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe believe the only way to do that is to power them down to reduce some of the cost. We have heard that we are spending so much money on the refineries, yet they are idle.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are costs associated with idle refineries; we have staff salaries and remuneration and then the power plant utility operations. And also we need to maintain the plants in terms of preservation and lost investments because they are assets that we believe can be brought to life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the NNPC was exiting the running of the country\u2019s four refineries, and it has recently called for bids from competent and qualified contractors for that purpose.\n\nYakubu explained that NNPC was not in the best position to run the refineries and has opted for a new model, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) for the running of the facilities.\n\nHe added that it is important to bring in O&M professionals, especially given the fact that as an engineer in the NNPC, no matter how competent, the employee must exit when they hit 60 years of age.\n\nThe COO said Expression of Interest (EoI) for organisations that would run the refineries was already out and many people had been evaluated.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NNPC will choose the best contractors to handle the project.\n\nAccording to him, it is becoming more difficult to get local lenders to finance fossil fuel businesses because of the renewable energy drive, adding that the NNPC is also looking for investors for the rehabilitation of its pipelines because they remain the best way to transport products from refineries to depots.\n\nDPR Targets N900bn Remittance into Federation Account in Q2\n\nThe DPR has said it is targeting to generate and remit about N900 billion into the Federation Account in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe agency has also received over $20 billion investment proposals since the inauguration of the Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) in Lagos by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Director of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, at a strategic management session with the management of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) yesterday in Lagos, said the agency exceeded its first quarter revenue generation target by 6.99 per cent and that the actual amount it remitted was N452 billion.\n\nThe NEITI team was led by its Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, who said the team came to seek partnership with DPR on how to collectively ensure transparency and create value for Nigerians through the country\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nAuwalu added that the agency was working to double the first quarter remittance and is trying to support the government to deliver services to the people.\n\n\u201cJanuary to March, we exceeded our target by 6.99 per cent. Actual collection, first quarter, N452 billion already sent to government and between April, May and June, I think if we are lucky, we will double this.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be around N900 billion, which is the budgeted figure. We are trying our best to support this government to make sure that this government really works for Nigerians,\u201d Auwalu said.\n\nHe stated that the agency was serious about recovering whatever was due to the government which could be through withholding service instruments and penalties.\n\nHe added that the agency would rather want more royalties than penalties as a business enabler and a revenue generator.\n\nAuwalu said this could be achieved through the various strategies adopted by the agency like automation of business and making sure that it improves transparency and accountability.\n\nHowever, the DPR boss said since the inauguration of the National Oil and Gas Excellence Centre (NOGEC) by the president, DPR had received investment proposals of over $20 billion from local and foreign investors.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I think there is a need to have an in depth understanding of this. Some recoveries are for State governments \u2013 specific state governments. I know there was a time recovery on behalf Plateau, there was one for Bayelsa, there was one for Delta. Such recoveries goes specifically to thoseStatess.\u201d\n\nWhen further asked where the Ibori loot was paid into, Idris without mincing words, had said it was paid to Delta State government.\n\nWhen he was reminded that his claim was contrary to the stance of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had said the agreement the federal government had with the British government was to use the repatriated loot to complete specific ongoing projects, Idris had said, \u201cNo, no, any recovery that is arising from looted funds from a particular State goes to the State. The State governors will not even allow this to fly. They will take the federal government to court for holding their money.

          "text": "The 20th Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd.), lobbied his way at the Presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be posted to neighbouring Benin Republic for a number of reasons, military sources have informed SaharaReporters.\n\nBuratai alongside the former Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.); former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas (retd.) and former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar (retd.), were relieved of their appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari on January 26.\n\nLt General Yusuf Tukur Buratai.\n\nA week later, they were gifted with ambassadorial appointments \u2013 a decision condemned by a cross-section of Nigerians who believed that the former service chiefs should be probed particularly on the controversial $1 billion arms fund released between 2018 and 2019.\n\nMilitary sources told SaharaReporters that one of the reasons Buratai, whose tenure was marred with complaints of non-payment of soldiers\u2019 allowances as well as poor fighting weapons, lobbied Benin Republic was to keep his eye on military activities and decisions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe former army chief still has his loyalists and stooges in the Nigerian Army, expectedly who will stop at nothing to ensure that the infractions of his tenure remain covered up. Buhari\u2019s administration cannot probe Buratai, certainly, because his loyalists know how to hide and manipulate the records. Buratai must be close by so that he can pull the strings to ensure that no probe or investigation is traced to him. Hence, his lobbying to be in Benin Republic,\u201d a source said.\n\nAnother source stated that Buaratai lobbied the small West African country with little or no responsibility in order to be engrossed in a lot of diplomatic activities as to military oversight.\n\nSee Also Military EXCLUSIVE: Buratai, Olonisakin, Other Ex-Service Chiefs To Forfeit Salaries As Nigerian Ambassadors\n\n\u201cNothing happens in Benin Republic really. Buratai can be in Lagos or Kano or Borno and be overseeing Benin Republic from there. It is just a simple calculation. The Nigerian Army is now highly politicised and highly divided than ever, because the bad boys don\u2019t want their records to be dug out.

          "text": "The 20th Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd.), lobbied his way at the Presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be posted to neighbouring Benin Republic for a number of reasons, military sources have informed SaharaReporters.\n\nBuratai alongside the former Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.); former Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas (retd.) and former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar (retd.), were relieved of their appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari on January 26.\n\nLt General Yusuf Tukur Buratai.\n\nA week later, they were gifted with ambassadorial appointments \u2013 a decision condemned by a cross-section of Nigerians who believed that the former service chiefs should be probed particularly on the controversial $1 billion arms fund released between 2018 and 2019.\n\nMilitary sources told SaharaReporters that one of the reasons Buratai, whose tenure was marred with complaints of non-payment of soldiers\u2019 allowances as well as poor fighting weapons, lobbied Benin Republic was to keep his eye on military activities and decisions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe former army chief still has his loyalists and stooges in the Nigerian Army, expectedly who will stop at nothing to ensure that the infractions of his tenure remain covered up. Buhari\u2019s administration cannot probe Buratai, certainly, because his loyalists know how to hide and manipulate the records. Buratai must be close by so that he can pull the strings to ensure that no probe or investigation is traced to him. Hence, his lobbying to be in Benin Republic,\u201d a source said.\n\nAnother source stated that Buaratai lobbied the small West African country with little or no responsibility in order to be engrossed in a lot of diplomatic activities as to military oversight.\n\nSee Also Military EXCLUSIVE: Buratai, Olonisakin, Other Ex-Service Chiefs To Forfeit Salaries As Nigerian Ambassadors\n\n\u201cNothing happens in Benin Republic really. Buratai can be in Lagos or Kano or Borno and be overseeing Benin Republic from there. It is just a simple calculation. The Nigerian Army is now highly politicised and highly divided than ever, because the bad boys don\u2019t want their records to be dug out. The government has refused to probe the six years of Buratai\u2019s administration, despite the cries of the National Assembly over the $1 billion arms fund probe.\n\n\u201cThey summoned the late army chief, Lt Gen Attahiru Ibrahim and that officer told them plainly that his predecessors and not him; should be summoned.

First, you cannot cure fraud. Second, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President.\n\n\u201cOr can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 constitution? The fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become an Iroko tree which has branches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound round the Presidential system of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know that previous sessions of national assembly made laws to convene a national conference.

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "title": "Dominic Joshua\u2019s \u2018hedge fund\u2019 paid out 30% monthly returns. Then the scam unravelled",
          "text": "He claimed to be investing in real estate, forex and Chanel. There was no proof.\n\nIn December 2020, Michelle Adigun* transferred \u20a6300,000 ($750) to Brisk Capital, an investment firm she discovered on Instagram. The firm promised to pay her 30% of that capital for three consecutive months.\n\nThe promise was fulfilled. The last 30% was paid alongside her initial capital. Thrilled by this, Adigun more than doubled her commitment to \u20a6700,000 on March 2, 2021. Same monthly promise as above. No questions asked.\n\nBut on the 2nd of April when she was to receive the first payment, Adigun did not. \u201cThis is when trouble suddenly started,\u201d she says to TechCabal.\n\nThat payment arrived two weeks later after Adigun repeatedly pressured Dominic Ngene Joshua, the founder and head of Brisk Capital, on Instagram. But that was as good as it got. No return has been paid for May.\n\nAdigun says her sister also invested in Brisk Capital but never received any returns. They and two other people, who spoke to TechCabal anonymously, are among the latest victims of a familiar scam couched as an investment opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nJoshua, the 21-year-old self-styled \u2018Investment Maestro\u2019 behind the Brisk wheel, is now in the custody of the Nigeria Police Force on a number of charges including investment fraud and stealing. A picture of him holding a board with those charges is dated May 1st 2021.\n\nSource: Nnamdi Chife/Twitter\n\nThe police say that Joshua has diverted \u20a62 billion from over 500 investors. He has spent some of that money on \u201cparties, exotic cars, luxury watches, real estate in Abuja, Lagos and Port-Harcourt,\u201d according to a statement from the special fraud unit on Monday.\n\nHow the heck did a 21-year-old do all that in barely six months?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk business\u201d\n\nBrisk Capital joined Twitter in October 2020. On the 19th of the same month, Joshua\u2019s caption on his first Instagram photo read \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Business. I am back\u2026\u201d\n\nHe had apparently been off social media for one year and had spent time \u201clearning and building a legacy focused on helping people gain financial security.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, his Instagram became a well-curated gallery of professionally taken pictures with apt captions. When EndSARS protesters were shot in Lekki, he said the right things \u2013 calling for calm and mourning the dead.\n\nAfter that week, he moved on to themes more in sync with the brand he was building: wealth, success and investments.\n\n\u201cFor the remaining part of the year, I would be committed towards empowering 5 business owners with $100 each every Friday,\u201d he said on October 26, 2020. Winners would be picked from the comments section. \u201c#fundsfriday.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that should have raised questions but Joshua did not invent giveaways on social media. Influencers with verifiable jobs do it all the time but anyone with enough followers and an image of wealth can also find a thirsty audience. Joshua did not have to prove anything about his job and income even if he was just twenty years old.\n\nPosh Josh sells Chanel\n\nEmpowered with an increasingly posh image and a slick Brisk Capital website, Joshua began taking funds from willing investors.\n\nThere is no difficulty with Brisk. We make investment a simple journey for you by taking the right investment decisions that yield the best result. We take up this responsibility and make your decision to invest a smooth, stress-free and easy one.\u201d Brisk Capital\n\nNnamdi Chife runs Chive GPS, a firm based in Abuja which does debt recovery and background checks. A client contacted him in December saying he wanted to invest with Joshua to earn the promised 30% monthly returns.\n\nAs part of a background check, Chife says he spoke with Joshua to verify Brisk Capital\u2019s business portfolio and investment methodology.\n\nJoshua explained that he invests his pool of client funds in real estate, forex trades and high-value fashion brands like Chanel \u2013 supposedly as a licensee who receives discounts on products.\n\nChife was anything but convinced, advising his client against investing.\n\nAn advisory note from ChiveGPS, a consultancy, to a client who wanted to invest with Dominic Joshua\u2019s Brisk Capital. Source: Chive GPS.\n\n\u201cThere was no record anywhere to establish that he did what he did,\u201d Chife says to TechCabal, describing Brisk Capital as a product-backed Ponzi scheme.\n\n\u201cWhat he provided was a manipulated dashboard of supposed forex trades.\u201d\n\nBut Joshua convinced people that he was legit. Adigun and one other victim say they were partly convinced to invest after a dinner party in December where some music artists performed. Rema, a Nigerian artist, made a gleeful post on Twitter celebrating returns from Brisk.\n\nScreenshot of a tweet by Rema, a Nigerian artist. It is not clear if this was a pad campaign on Brisk Capital\u2019s behalf.\n\nJoshua also had foot soldiers who drove sign-ups.\n\nOne victim who invested \u20a6500,000 and received 30% returns in February and March of this year says she was convinced by Brisk Capital\u2019s marketers in her school, Abia State University. According to Chife, one person brought in hundreds of people who invested up to \u20a6700 million with Brisk Capital.\n\nBut dark clouds began to converge around Joshua in April. After a heady start, his book was now filled with promises of payouts; too many to fulfill.\n\nVictims say Joshua and Brisk Capital stopped responding to payment enquiries on WhatsApp. The latest posts on the company\u2019s Instagram and Twitter accounts are from March.\n\nDoominic\n\nOn April 19, Chive GPS sent a demand notice to Joshua. It was on behalf of a client who had not received the second payment for a \u20a6200 million investment made in December.\n\nWhen Joshua failed to respond to the notice, Chive GPS involved the Nigeria Police\u2019s Special Fraud Unit. They tracked and arrested Joshua who was already making plans to leave Nigeria according to Chife whose tweet this week brought Joshua\u2019s escapades to light.\n\nThe Police said some of the properties Joshua bought with his victims\u2019 deposits have been recovered. He will be charged to a Federal High Court when an ongoing strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria ends.\n\nVictims hope the process will help recover their deposits. \u201cI invested \u20a6200,000 in December, which was due by March. I have not been paid till now,\u201d one said.\n\nShe had invested because she knew people who worked with Joshua. Her friends had cashed out too. But all she has now is the hope of at least getting her capital back.\n\nChife expects the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to take over the matter. But based on other similar Ponzi schemes that have crashed, he is not sure how many people will get back their money from Joshua.\n\nLike victims of other scams, Joshua\u2019s victims admit the 21-year-old\u2019s promise of 30% monthly returns at zero-commission or fund management fees was always too good to be true.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do enough due diligence. I should have gone through appropriate authorities and done my background check,\u201d one said.\n\nShe thought the percentage was outrageous but trusted her friend who was a Brisk Capital agent to help her invest.\n\n\u201cIf I had also known my friend didn\u2019t know Joshua that well, I wouldn\u2019t have invested.\u201d\n\nBack in January, Adigun had been impressed when Joshua temporarily stopped taking deposits. \u201cBrisk gave the impression they were deliberately managing their hedge fund to keep it sizable. I am just surprised that the guy\u2019s intent was to defraud after all.\u201d\n\nApparently, Joshua has admitted his crimes to the Police, pleading for time to return what he owes. That\u2019s good news for Adigun. \u201cTo get my refund. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\n* Name of victims were changed or withheld to protect identity",

Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively. The company is well-known for its social and charity activities.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "People caught sharing pornography on the Internet in Kenya might soon find themselves guilty of an offence punishable by either a 25-year-jail term, a Ksh 20 million fine, or both.\n\nThis is proposed by a bill currently before the Parliament of Kenya titled, The Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Bill, 2021.\n\nThis bill seeks to amend the current Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act 2018, which has been severely scrutinised in Kenyan courts.\n\nApart from the initial proposal which we have mentioned, the bill also empowers the government to block access to certain websites in Kenya. The bill also provides for regulating online activities related to terrorism, cultism, and religious extremism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer iFreeKe, Bloggers Association of Kenya (BAKE) says the move to amend the Cybercrimes Act seems to complicate rather than address previously raised issues.\n\nKenya and pornography\n\nAfrica\u2019s attitude towards adult pornography is quite lax for a continent famous for its largely religious citizens. Very few countries have any laws prohibiting activities relating to adult pornography.\n\nHowever, there is a prevalence of laws on child pornography as contained in most enactments on cybercrime in line with the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. Section 24 of Kenya\u2019s Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act provides for this.\n\nOn the other hand, Kenyan law has no clear provisions for the sale, possession, and production of pornography; until now, it has done nothing to curb distribution online.\n\nIn November 2018, the government announced plans to filter porn websites and regulate films with explicit content to stop teenage pregnancies. The Communications Authority of Kenya was the agency in charge of that mandate.\n\nThe then ICT Cabinet Secretary, Joe Mucheru, said that the government had employed advanced technology to address the problem. However, it is not clear the exact technology it used and if at all the plans were carried out.\n\nThis new amendment regarding Internet pornography raises questions as to how the government intends to implement this law. There are suggestions that this could be done via the increased powers of the National Computer and Cybercrimes Co-ordination Committee.\n\nThe Committee can recommend websites that may be rendered inaccessible in the country.

He says the bill will go a long way in saving families.\n\nWhile this is laudable, organisations such as Reporters Without Borders consistently warn against Internet filtering.\n\nThis is because, aside from issues touching on Internet freedom and neutrality, it could lead to slower connection speeds and blocking unrelated content.\n\nThese legitimate concerns certainly throw up some dust on Kenya\u2019s Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Bill.\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from Pixabay\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nEmmanuel and Victoria here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing\n\nOPay\u2019s planned $400m raise\n\nCribMd\u2019s $2.6m seed round\n\nEnye\u2019s plan to build the next tech superstars\n\nOPay\u2019s planned $400m raise\n\nAnother funding round on the way: African digital payment platform, OPay, is reportedly about to close a $400 million seed round at a valuation of more than $1.5 billion. This is coming after raising $170 million in 2019 to expand to Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa.\n\nFun fact: Although OPay is an African platform, some Chinese VCs backed its funding rounds of 2019. The rounds were led by Chinese VCs such as Source Code Capital, Sequoia Capital China, IDG Capital, Gaorong Capital, Redpoint China and Bertelsmann Asia Investments, and SoftBank Ventures Asia, the VC arm of SoftBank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNote: It could become the second-largest ever funding round by an African startup. It will be topped only by Jumia\u2019s $603m Series C. This could also be Africa\u2019s second unicorn in 2021.\n\nGo deeper: Top funding rounds in the African tech space\n\nWhat I find baffling is how the funds would be used to help speed up OPay\u2019s expansion into new African markets even after raising funds for the same reason in 2019.\n\nOPay planned to expand to Kenya, Ghana, and South Africa in 2019, but it only could enter Ghana. However, it also entered Egypt. Why wasn\u2019t OPay able to expand to other countries with $150 million? Your guess is as good as mine.\n\nCould this be related?Lagos to enforce ban on Gokada, MAX, ORide, others from highways, starting February 2020.\n\nOr this? OPay finally drops super app ambition; restructures model.\n\nAs reported by Opera, OPay\u2019s total gross transaction value grew by 350% last year to over $2 billion in December 2020. This growth might be attributable to the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nOPay neither confirmed nor denied the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCribMd\u2019s $2.6m seed round\n\nAfter raising $250k in a pre-seed round and $100k in February 2021, an 11-month-old Nigerian healthtech startup, CribMD, has closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based VC, Sputnik ATX; Swedish accelerator, Norrsken; and mass media company, The Guardian Nigeria.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible but the co-founders said they turned down several investors and investments.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, on Tuesday took another twist as a group of leaders of the party suspended the former Chairman of the party in the State, Adelowo Adebiyi, for forming a new group.\n\nThe group, called \u201cIgbimo Agba\u201d accused Adebiyi of causing disunity within the party.\n\nThe decision to suspend Adebiyi, who now chairs a splinter group of the party, The Osun Progressives (TOP), was reached at the monthly meeting of the group held on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Chairman of the group, Sola Akinwumi, the group also passed \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d on the administration of Governor Gboyega Oyetola and the leadership of the caretaker Chairman of the party, Gboyega Famoodun.\n\nBut, Adebiyi while reacting to his suspension from the group expressed disappointment saying members of the group should have given him a fair hearing.\n\nThe former Chairman of APC while featuring on a popular radio programme in Osun said members of Igbimo Agba only based their decision to suspend him on just a radio interview, saying he deserved to be given a fair hearing.\n\n\u201cThey should have given me a fair hearing before suspending me. They should not have relied on the radio interview to make the decision. I am appealing to them to give me a fair hearing.\n\n\u201cWe have not been meeting regularly for me to brief the elders on the state of things. After the ENDSARS protest, the house of our chairman was attacked and we have not been meeting regularly, our last meeting was held at Osun State Government House. I briefed the Chairman of Elders caucus that the congress of the party is next month, June. I told him that there is a need for us to mobilise people,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the acting Secretary of APC Igbimo Agba, Hon. Omolaoye Oluremi Akintola, said TOP was formed with a view to weakening the party. He added that the formation of the TOP or any other group within the party is an aberration and inordinate arrangement to scuttle or weaken the party which he said would not be allowed.\n\nOmolaoye said though Elder Adebiyi only suspended as a member of Igbimo Agba but not as a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nDebunking the allegations of causing the disunity among the members of the party, Adebiyi said: \u201cWe, The Osun Progressives (TOP) are not here to divide the party but to sensitise members of the party, TOP is a caucus or group within the party that is recognized by the Constitution in the Article 9 and 12 of APC constitution where we have the former chairman of the party, the current secretary of the party, ex-commissioners, ex-vice chairman and Honourables. Our objective is to promote internal democracy in the party.\n\n\u201cAccording to Article 20, 1(A) that all post shall be filled with the elected member. This is our goal, to promote equity, fairness and justice within the party. To ensure transparency, accountability in party management. Where is a course of division in this?\n\n\u201cAfter the election of 2018, I met Governor Oyetola because it is embarrassing that we won the election with just 500 votes despite that we are controlling the centre and the state. When I was the chairman of the party it was not like that, we won by over 100,000 votes despite we are not at the centre. I expressed my concern to the governor and I even gave him a proposal of the way forward. 2022 election is right in the corner and we must be prepared.\n\n\u201cIt is a misconception that we are using the group to work against the current governor. We want a formidable and capable hand to take over the affairs of the party. In Oyo State, despite the good works of Senator Ibikunle Ajimonbi we lost to PDP in the state. We want to ensure that we have democratic elected capable and effective hands in charge of our party.\n\n\u201cThe party secretariat is like a ghost, with no activities to engage members, there is no life in the party again. This is a concern to us. I am comfortable with the leadership of the party. We want a level playing ground for those who become the executives of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in fighting Governor Oyetola. I urge our leaders to sit down and talk about the plan of the party. I had a meeting with the Chairman of the party, Prince Adegboyega Famodun and the governor and I presented nine points to them.\n\n\u201cThat we must understudy our poor performance during the 2018 election, have good relations with the party, members and electorates, monitor government policies, promote synergy with the party structures, make input in policy formation, implementation, evaluation and good service delivery, to improve the relationship of the party with private sectors and individuals. With the current evaluation, oppositions are not coming into the party. I submitted the proposal over one year ago, only one of the agenda was attended to.\n\n\u201cWe are the one that initiated the process of wooing Oyinlola and late Isiaka Adeleke to our party. Politic is dynamic.\n\n\u201cOyetola and Aregbesola are two different personalities, their perspectives on issues differs. If there are issues between them they are from the same source, they know how to reconcile their differences. The major aim is how we can ensure that the party is strong ahead of elections.\n\n\u201cAbout 6 months ago, Chief Akande call the party leaders into a meeting in Ila Orangun and we complained of these issues and we urge him to look into the matters. Baba set up a committee to look into these issues but till now they are still working on it. On this issue of TOP posterity will bless. Baba Akande agreed that there is inefficiency within Osun APC that needs to be worked upon. He set up a committee one per each federal constituency in the state to work on the efficiency of the party.\n\n\u201cWe have groups within the APC, we have Ilerioluwa, the governor\u2019s campaign group, Oromiyan group within the same party, I am surprised that TOP is now giving some people concern.\n\n\u201cIf people support Oyetola second term ambition we will support him. He is performing. If the governor reach out to us we will support him base on agreements which is conditional\u201d\n\nMeanwhile , the leaders and members of APC in Ijesa North Federal Constituency, made up of Obokun and Oriade Local Government areas in Osun State, have distanced themselves from the splinter group which has the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, as the Chairman of its Board of Trustees.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the party leaders and members in the zone, Otunba Jumoke Ogunkeyede, the overall leader of Obokun LG APC, said the decision of TOP to oppose the party being led by Governor Oyetola and team up with Aregbesola, who was believed to be in rift with the governor, was \u201ctantamount to evil, egregious and unscrupulous act which should be discountenanced in its entirety.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that with all the giant strides of Mr. Governor in the state, some elements under the guise of the Osun Progressive (TOP) have made themselves willing tools in the hand of the devil, all with the aims of distracting Mr. Governor from properly managing the Osun economy which has once crippled. We will use all our arsenals to stand by Mr. Governor to continue his good work in Osun beyond 2022.\n\n\u201cWe will also resist these disgruntled ones until they retrace their steps and team up with the people\u2019s governor whose hard work has been earning him accolades and awards from within the state and all over Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder no circumstance will the leadership and members of this Federal Constituency abandon truly progressive efforts of our amiable and goal getting governor for a group whose only cause of action is cruel hatred towards a perfectly responsible, responsive and a performing governor whose level of attentiveness is second to none,\u201d the constituency said.",

However, as of December 31, 2020, the country\u2019s debt portfolio had risen to N32.92tn.\n\nThis shows that within a period of five and half years, the country\u2019s debt has risen by N20.8tn.\n\nThis period corresponds with the Presidency of President Muhammadu Buhari who assumed leadership of the country on May 29, 2015.\n\nIt also means that within the period, the country\u2019s debt portfolio rose by 171.62 per cent, PUNCH reported.\n\nOf the total debt of N32.92tn, the Federal Government has a total of N26.91tn, leaving a balance of N6.01tn to sub-national governments, mainly, the 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory Administration.\n\nThe implication of this is that 83.78 per cent of the nation\u2019s debt stock belongs to the Federal Government, with the sub-national government accounting for 16.22 per cent.\n\nFurther analysis by PUNCH shows that domestic sources accounted for N20.21tn while external sources accounted for N12.71tn.\n\nIn percentage terms, external debts accounted for 38.6 per cent of the total debt portfolio while domestic debts accounted for 61.4 per cent.\n\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has ridiculed the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\n\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26tn on debt servicing.\n\nWhile servicing local debts gulped N8.53tn between July 2015 and December 2020, servicing external debts gulped N1.72tn from 2016 to December 2020 (external debt servicing converted to Naira at the exchange rate prevailing at the time, provided by the DMO).\n\nThe data provided by the DMO showed that from July to December 2015, N489.59bn was expended on servicing local debts.\n\nFrom January to December, a total of N1.23tn was spent to service the country\u2019s domestic debts in 2016. The figure rose to N1.48tn in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s domestic debt servicing bill rose to N1.8tn. The cost of domestic debt servicing came down a bit in 2019 to N1.69tn. In 2020, it rose again to N1.85tn.\n\nOn the other hand, external debt servicing consumed $353.09m in 2016. In went up to $464.05m in 2017 and jumped up to $1.47bn in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the nation spent $1.33bn on external debt servicing. In 2020, external debt servicing gulped $1.56bn.\n\nThe rise in the country\u2019s debt servicing reflected the nation\u2019s increasing commitment to external loans.\n\nGiven the high cost of local debt servicing previously, the Federal Government deliberately moved to secure more external loans.\n\nThe government\u2019s policy was to rebalance the country\u2019s debt portfolio to 60 per cent local debts and 40 per cent foreign debts.\n\nHowever, dwindling revenues arising from low receipts from oil and gas exports presented the government with a dilemma.\n\nFalling local currency had brought to the fore the foreign exchange risk inherent in securing foreign loans while the need to shore up foreign exchange proceeds had made it difficult for the government to wean itself from foreign borrowings.\n\nIn fact, the President had about a fortnight ago asked the Senate to approve another $6.18bn external borrowing for the government.\n\nBuhari said the proposed loan which is equivalent to N2.3tn is to finance the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6tn.\n\nHe said the loan would enable the Federal Government to fund critical infrastructural projects in transportation, health, and education among others.\n\nWhen the National Assembly eventually approves the new debt plan, the implementation will take the country\u2019s debt portfolio higher.",

I thought the insecurity will stop at the banditry and the Boko Haram thing but with what is happening in the South, it is no more a Fulani thing.\n\n\u201cMy concern is what has INEC office done that you will go and burn it, what will you achieve? But then when you look at the sub-total of people who constitutionally have a right to ask but not to burn and not to fight, but to ask.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of treason in this country but I think the people who are burning INEC offices and police stations are people who are trying to provoke the state, I mean the country; by provoking the country they want an action that will be taken that they will not justify all their actions.\n\n\u201cMaybe it may be too much to ask because it is part of the fundamental human rights of people; this dual citizenship thing, I think we must look at it and review it properly. Are you a Nigerian or not a Nigerian?\n\n\u201cYou will go and serve in the military of a foreign country, then you come back to Nigeria and start agitating for what is not, that is one for that purpose.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn other countries unless you satisfy certain requirements you cannot even run for elections. But here everybody wakes up and begin to run for elections, producing leaders that sometimes may not appreciate the gravity of the situation that we are in.\n\n\u201cSo it is very important that our security agencies and believe me, each institutions have one security agency or the other, from the military down to the actual SSS, to investigate this matter properly so that we can separate them from what we consider the insecurity \u2013 kidnapping, banditry and Boko Haram from this particular internal provocateurs who are trying to provoke the state. We need to distinguish and understand what is happening.\n\n\u201cThey may relate because we know about these groups that are agitating for separation, agitating for secession and co; so they may be the ones now who are doing this particular one to encourage them and to give them a justification to continue.\n\n\u201cI believe, maybe I am too hopeful, the PDP, the former Governors Forum of PDP, indeed the former Governors Forum of Nigeria, and by the way I am the coordinating chairman of the former PDP Governors in Nigeria; we will not agree for secession, we will not support military intervention. Military intervention should remain as history in Nigeria. Whatever mistakes we have made will be corrected as we go along. Any intervention now, will take us back,\u201d Aliyu said.\n\nHe also said it was morally wrong for governors to defect to another party having gotten elected on the platform of another party.\n\nReferencing the recent defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Aliyu said: \u201cit is a PDP state, we may lose some but we are going to win that state back. I will love in the future to see either a constitutional provision or in our electoral law to say if a party elects you to a particular office, gives you a mandate, president, governor, national and state assembly, councilor, chairman of a local government, that if for any reason you don\u2019t want to go with that party then you should resign but not to defect with the mandate.\n\n\u201cFor example, these ones that you are referring to, they have defected with the mandate of PDP to APC. That is morally wrong and politically incorrect because the political culture that we are building, we are already putting the holes of political correction in them.\n\n\u201cSo a law must be established.

Dave Umahi in Abakaliki by the Police Assistant Inspector General (AIG) Zone 9, Mr. Okon, the governor openly and without any investigation, criminally accused prominent leaders of our party, including, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, Senator Sam Egwu, Chief Ali Odefa, Hon. Linus Okorie among others as sponsors of banditry and violence in the State.\n\n\u201cIt is already common knowledge that agents of the Governor Umahi-led administration had gathered known cultists and thugs and armed them with dangerous weapons including pump action riffles to be unleashed on innocent citizens, particularly members of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThese agents of APC government in Ebonyi State have also resorted to using the thugs to disrupt the meetings of our party as well as foist a reign of terror in the state, wherein thugs have taken over the streets and openly extort money from helpless motorists.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, a member of our Party, Barr. Amos Ogbonnaya, who refused to join Governor Umahi to the APC was abducted and later released with life threatening injuries after much public outcry. He is still in the intensive care unit of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThough Ogbonnaya recognized his abductors as state government agents, and reported to the Police and DSS, no arrests have been made to bring the perpetrators to book.\n\n\u201cAlso, on the 30th of November 2020 one of our members, Mr. Shedrack Nwode, a native of Umuezoka, along with his fianc\u00e9e were shot dead by thugs suspected to be working for the APC, for refusing to chant \u2018APC, Change\u2019 at a traditional wedding ceremony.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on Friday, 4th of December 2020, three prominent supporters of PDP from Ugwulangwu in Governor Umahi\u2019s own LGA were arrested on trump-up charges of being cultists.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, Chief Henry C. Udeh (Ajim Best), from Okposi in Ohaozara LGA was brutally attacked for daring to hold PDP meeting in his own house, and many valuables, including vehicles were destroyed.\n\n\u201cJust now, we received a report that a member of our party, Prince Anyigor Methuselah KS, of Ezza North has been abducted and is reportedly being kept at the Cabinet Office of the old government house in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cOur party further alerts Nigerians of Governor Umahi\u2019s resort to labelling opposition voices in the state as cultists and terrorist elements as a ploy to victimize members of our party as well as incite federal security agencies against our leaders.\n\n\u201cGovernor Umahi\u2019s suppressive government is now sealing off homes and businesses of PDP members, all in a bid to cow and silence them.\n\n\u201cA hotel belonging to former Governor Sam Egwu has been sealed up while a private school belonging to another member of the PDP, Barr.

          "title": "Revealed! How Manchester United\u2019s \u2018trophyless\u2019 seasons turned Samuel Chukwueze\u2019s Villarreal to Europa League Champions",
          "text": "David de Gea failed at the end of a marathon penalty shootout as Villarreal dashed Manchester United\u2019s hopes of Europa League glory in Gdansk.\n\nThis was a disappointing contest lacking in quality and producing only three shots on target across 120 minutes \u2013 but drama arrived with the spot-kicks.\n\nAll 20 outfield players converted their penalties in the longest shootout in a final of any Uefa competition, and in an increasingly tense stadium Villarreal goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli blasted home his effort and then denied De Gea, who was crestfallen at the end.\n\nIt gave Villarreal a first major trophy in their history and saw former Arsenal boss Unai Emery lift the Europa League for an unprecedented fourth time.\n\nHowever, on the anniversary of both Sir Matt Busby\u2019s birth and the epic Champions League final in 1999 that earned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hero status among the Old Trafford faithful, there was to be no new 26 May landmark as United complete a fourth year without silverware.\n\nUnited simply did not do enough, despite the massive gulf in transfer fees and salaries between the two clubs.\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s side did not start well and fell behind to a soft goal from Gerard Moreno.\n\nEdinson Cavani dragged United level 10 minutes into the second period after a Marcus Rashford shot had been deflected into his path, but United failed to build on that momentum and by the end Solskjaer was introducing Juan Mata and Alex Telles purely to take penalties in the shootout.\n\nBoth players scored. Although given De Gea had failed to save any of the previous 21 penalties he had faced, maybe Solskjaer should have followed the example of former United boss Louis van Gaal, who famously brought on Tim Krul purely for a shootout at the 2014 World Cup, which the Netherlands went on to win.\n\nFor most of this season, no-one has been quite sure which United were going to turn up. It felt like that across the whole game in Gdansk, as they alternated between inventive and passive almost with each passing minute.\n\nEvidently, Solskjaer felt he had no choice other than to stick with it.\n\nIn the final game of last season, he waited until the 87th minute of the semi-final defeat by Sevilla before making a change.\n\nBy then, his side were losing, so it was not a shock the Norwegian had not used any of the six he was allowed on this occasion as extra time began.\n\nThe brutal truth is, having gone with his strongest offensive starting XI, there was no-one on the bench Solskjaer felt confident could improve the situation.\n\nIn Cavani and Mason Greenwood, two of United\u2019s best performers were attackers. But Rashford had a poor game, which was summed up by the England man failing to convert when Greenwood had given him a clear sight at goal.\n\nAny goal would have been ruled offside but Rashford was not to know that as his scuffed effort rolled wide.\n\nScott McTominay\u2019s midfield industry outshone both Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba, who both flitted in and out of the game without producing anything truly remarkable.\n\nDefensive slip-up\n\nIt would be easy to point to the absence of captain Harry Maguire as the key factor in Moreno\u2019s opener.\n\nBut Maguire was on the pitch when United conceded a very similar kind of goal against Everton in February.\n\nOn that occasion it was Dominic Calvert-Lewin who slid the ball past De Gea as United\u2019s defence failed to deal with a free-kick floated from a deep position into their penalty area.\n\nThis time Moreno\u2019s run into the box went unchecked, allowing him to get in front of Victor Lindelof and turn Dani Parejo\u2019s free-kick into De Gea\u2019s goal.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "NGF: Legislature, Judiciary autonomy doesn\u2019t require Executive Order 10",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Wednesday said the Executive Order 10 issued 2020 by President Muhammadu Buhari to guarantee financial autonomy of state legislature and judiciary was needless.\n\nThe governors said there was no basis for the Order aimed at supporting implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature, insisting the president was ill-advised.\n\nNGF Vice Chairman and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this in Ado-Ekiti at a colloquium organised by the Ekiti state Ministry of Justice Academy, in honour of the retiring Chief Judge of the state, Justice Ayodeji Daramola.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cThe Judicial Autonomy: Perspective of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum,\u201d Tambuwal said the Forum expected President Buhari to have consulted widely before issuing the order, describing the unilateral exercise of such powers as \u2018sheer illegality.\u2019\n\nWhile pointing out that the governors were not opposed to financial autonomy for the concerned arms of government, Tambuwa said the delay in implementation was occasioned by the process, structure and quest for legal clarity.\n\n\u201cNigeria in Section 121(3) provides that: \u201cAny amount standing to the credit of the \u2013 (a) House of Assembly of the State; and (b) Judiciary In the Consolidated revenue Fund of the State shall be paid directly to the said bodies respectively; in the case of the judiciary, such amount shall be paid directly to the heads of the courts concerned.\n\n\u201cAs Governors of the 36 States under the platform of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), let me state very clearly that we are unequivocally committed to the autonomy of the judiciary and the legislature.\n\n\u201cIn the journey to our current position as Chief Executives of our various States, we have all benefitted from the independence and professionalism of the judiciary, be it at the level of administering our Oath of Office or our electoral victory being upheld at the Tribunal or in Court in the interest of democracy, justice, and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe concept of judicial autonomy has its foundations in the time tested doctrine of Separation of Powers. The main object is to avoid autocratic government by eliminating the over concentration of powers in one person, agency or institution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical democratic elements is the principle of checks and balances between and among the three arms of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent misunderstanding on the financial autonomy of the Judiciary is predicated on the need to establish an implementation framework to the 4th Alteration of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Section 121(3). What we have questioned, and we have made this known at every opportunity, is the process of implementing this provision of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we will be failing in our responsibility if we refuse to draw the attention of the President, stakeholders and the country to grave concerns about the constitutionality of Executive Order 10 of 2020. That was the basis of the position that we took on the Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order 10 ostensibly intended to support the implementation of judicial financial autonomy, was completely unnecessary and ill advised. Let me at this juncture state clearly that we never questioned the right of Mr. President to issue Executive Orders. We only stated that Section 121(3) did not require Presidential Executive Fiat to become implementable.\n\nTambuwal expressed delight that consensus has finally been reached on the autonomy conundrum and opined that the strike is expected to be suspended anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across States including the enactment of a Fund Management Law which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of constitution.\n\n\u201cBudgetary releases to the judiciary will be pro-rated based on the actual revenues recorded each month by the state government. Monthly revenue reconciliation and allocation will be presided over by a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to be set up under the Fund Management Law \u2013 a similar practice to what we have at the federal level.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this will put an end to the long weeks of strike action that have seen our judicial and criminal justice system grounded to a halt. We have lost so much in the past weeks. The big takeaway is the centrality of communication, sincerity, trust and dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe have requested that the President disbands the Presidential Implementation Committee on the Autonomy of State Legislature and Judiciary, to avert future rancor between the various arms of government, arising from misconceived guidance from a committee lacking the requisite understanding of constitutional matters,\u201d the NGF said.\n\nCorroborating Tambuwal\u2019s position, the NGF Chairman and Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi said the presidential directive was unconstitutional and illegal as it undermined the executive power of the governors stipulated in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said the states\u2019 governors were committed to financial autonomy for the legislature and judiciary, stressing that \u201cdemocracy can\u2019t endure if we subject the independence of these two arms to the jackboots of the governors.\n\n\u201cWho is to take capital spending for the judiciary and legislature has always been the controversy. The governors will continue to hold our judiciary with reverence because I know that this democracy will not endure, if we subject our judiciary to the jackboots of the executive.\n\n\u201cThere is no questioning the fact that we can do a lot more for our judiciary to make it truly independent.\u201d\n\nThe Sokoto state governor expressed happiness that a consensus was finally reached on the matter of judicial autonomy.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across States including the enactment of a Fund Management Law which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of constitution. Budgetary releases,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Justice Daramola said judicial autonomy was essential ingredients for democratic consolidation.\n\nHe further added that judicial autonomy was adequately guaranteed in the 1999 Constitution, saying Section 121 (3) was simple and should be respected by state governors.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

We ask the Senate Committee to consider our request.\u201d\n\nThe importance of security was the focus of Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma\u2019s address to the gathering that had Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, among other legislators from the South East.\n\nShedding more light on the group\u2019s request, Emmanuel Adaelu, leader of the Aba State Movement, said in Aba that the Ohanaeze Committee on State Creation recommended the creation of Aba State in the report it submitted to South East Governors\u2019 Forum more than two years ago.\n\n\u201cThe report is another pillar that supports our request,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Committee, which considered the merit for the creation of Aba and Adada States, resolved and recommended for the creation of Aba State, with 12 members supporting, and five abstaining. The Committee also recommended that any other State Creation exercise in the South East should give Adada State priority,\u201d the Committee\u2019s letter of 18 October 2018, to Governor Dave Umahi, chairman of the South East Governors\u2019 Forum stated.\n\nCommittee Chairman, Chigozie Ogbu, a professor and its Secretary, Uche Okwukwu, a barrister, signed the report.\n\nAdaelu said Aba State Movement stood by the Ohanaeze Committee recommendation since all groups agitating for a state in the South East fully participated in the Committee\u2019s work by making presentations to it.\u201cThe Committee did a great job. It went through the tomes of documents the 11 proposed areas for state creation submitted to it.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s leading stakeholder in the hospitality business, the management of BON HOTELS has reiterated its commitment to re-strategize to maintain professionalism and continuity in business to boost the nation\u2019 s economy.\n\nThe hotel management, which stated this while sharing experiences on how it was able to sustain it business during the heat of Covid-19 at a forum recently, noted that it will effectively drive the organization\u2019s plans and interventions in business in the current post COVID-19 recovery era.\n\nAccording to a statement issued in Abuja, it noted that \u201cwe have bolstered efforts to grow the industry saying \u201cAs the world gradually match towards the post Covid-19 Pandemic eras, the management of BON HOTELS have re-strategize to maintain professionalism and continuity in business.\u201d\n\nDuring the forum, its management disclosed that they were obviously not resting on their oars to remodel, re-strategize, and expand their reach for efficiency and ultimately to meet the demands and satisfaction of their customers despite the worst hit of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic which took heavy toll on every aspect of human endeavours across the globe.\n\n\u201d We will ensure unique and dynamic brand was sticking professionally to the fundamentals of the hospitality industry which is all about growth, service delivery and innovations which was in line with international best practice and impressively with the right and progressive management team and courteous and dedicated members of staff.\n\n\u201cThere is a popular adage that says; Tough times never last but tough people do. Consequently, it is in times of crisis that tough people, especially HEROES, are born.\n\nThey distinguish themselves in so many admirable ways.

          "text": "Palestinian group Hamas has promised not to touch \u201ca single cent\u201d of international aid to rebuild the besieged Gaza Strip after Israel bombarded the enclave for 11 days.\n\nYahya Sinwar, the head of the group\u2019s political wing in Gaza, on Wednesday promised the \u201ctransparent and impartial\u201d distribution of aid as a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas held for a sixth day.\n\n\u201cWe welcome any international or Arab effort to rebuild the Gaza Strip,\u201d Sinwar said.\n\n\u201cI affirm our commitment not to take a single cent intended for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never taken a cent in the past.\u201d\n\nSinwar\u2019s remarks came a day after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pledged his country\u2019s help in rebuilding Gaza on Tuesday, but stressed that the aid must not benefit Hamas, which rules the coastal territory.\n\nThe US idea is instead to work with the Palestinian Authority (PA), based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank and headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, reducing the risk of strengthening Hamas, which is considered a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d by the United States and the European Union.\n\nSinwar said Blinken\u2019s remarks were aimed at widening the divide between Hamas and the PA but insisted they would have no effect on relations between the rival Palestinian factions.\n\n\u201cWe will never fall for this trick and lash out at each other,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that the United Kingdom had pledged 3.2 million pounds ($4.5m) in emergency aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to support those in Gaza affected by recent hostilities.\n\nAccording to health authorities, at least 254 people, including 66 children, were killed in Gaza as Israel bombarded the Palestinian territory from air, land and sea for 11 days. At least 12 people, including two children, were killed in Israel by rocket attacks carried out by Hamas and other armed groups based in Gaza, Israeli authorities said.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Commission announced the European Union was boosting its humanitarian aid to Palestine by eight million euros ($9.8 million).\n\nAbbas\u2019s moderate Fatah party, which dominates the PA, has clashed with Hamas for years; Hamas drove Fatah out of Gaza in 2007 after Hamas legitimately won 2006 elections, and the latter has since ruled only the parts of the occupied West Bank that are not administered by Israel.\n\nBlinken is in the region to help cement the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that has so far held since coming into effect on Friday.\n\nThe latest flare-up in violence erupted on May 10 when Hamas sent volleys of rocket fire towards Israel after Israeli security forces stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound \u2013 a holy site in Jerusalem revered by Muslims and Jews \u2013 injuring hundreds of Palestinians.\n\nThe violence in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem followed crackdowns by Israeli forces on protesters demonstrating against the potential forced expulsion of Palestinians from their homes in favour of Jewish settlers.\n\nSinwar warned Israel against raiding Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and said that the recent escalation was nothing but an exercise in confrontation.\n\n\u201cOur people in Jerusalem must be ready to defend Al-Aqsa,\u201d he said, adding that the demise of Israel is tied to its violent measures in the city, by way of incursions at the compound and attacking Palestinian Jerusalemites.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has ordered intelligence agencies to investigate the emergence of Covid-19, amid growing controversy about the virus\u2019s origins.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Biden asked US intelligence groups to \u201credouble their efforts\u201d and report to him within 90 days.\n\nCovid-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.\n\nMore than 168 million cases have since been confirmed worldwide and at least 3.5 million deaths reported.\n\nAuthorities linked early Covid cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, and scientists believed the virus first passed to humans from animals.\n\nBut recent US media reports suggest growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a laboratory in China.\n\nBeijing has condemned the reports and suggested it could have come from a US laboratory instead.\n\nIn what passes for relative transparency in the US government, the Biden administration has conceded the American intelligence community is split on Covid-19\u2019s origins \u2013 it could be the lab or animal-to-human contact \u2013 and no-one is near certain about it.\n\nThat marks a big shift from the derision heaped on the lab theory by many in the media and politics last year, when Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senator Tom Cotton and others floated the idea.\n\nMr Trump and Mr Pompeo didn\u2019t help the situation, however, as they were coy about the grounds for their suspicion. And their theories floating alongside more far-fetched ones, such as that the disease was manufactured in a Chinese lab. That possibility still seems highly unlikely.\n\nThe public may never know the full truth about the virus\u2019 origins, particularly if China continues to be uncooperative.\n\nMr Biden is pledging a full investigation, however, and if the US finds conclusive evidence of a lab leak, it will mean more than just a few prominent figures having to eat crow and re-evaluate their trust in authoritative \u201cconclusions\u201d. It could place very real strain on US-China relations for years to come.\n\nIn a White House statement released on Wednesday, President Biden said he had asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office, \u201cincluding whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\u201d.\n\nOn receiving it this month, he asked for \u201cadditional follow-up\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the US Intelligence Community has coalesced around two likely scenarios but has not reached a definitive conclusion on this question,\u201d Mr Biden said.\n\n\u201cHere is their current position: \u2018While two elements in the IC leans toward the former scenario and one leans more toward the latter \u2013 each with low or moderate confidence \u2013 the majority of elements do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.'\u201d\n\nThe president has now asked agencies to \u201credouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion\u201d, and report to him within 90 days. He asked that Congress be kept \u201cfully apprised\u201d of the work.\n\nHe concluded by saying the US would \u201ckeep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence\u201d.\n\nBut a Washington Post column on Wednesday accused the Biden administration of thwarting congressional inquiries into Covid-19\u2019s origins, while passing the buck to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nMr Biden\u2019s statement also comes as CNN reported the president\u2019s administration this spring shut down a state department investigation into whether the virus could have leaked from a Wuhan lab, deeming the probe an ineffective use of resources.\n\nIn March this year, the WHO issued a report written jointly with Chinese scientists on the origins of Covid-19, saying the chances of it having started in a lab were \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d. The WHO acknowledged further study was needed.\n\nBut questions have persisted and recent reports attributed to US intelligence sources say three members of the Wuhan Institute of Virology were admitted to hospital in November 2019, several weeks before China acknowledged the first case of the new disease in the community.\n\nAnthony Fauci, President Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser, has maintained he believes the virus was passed from animals to humans, though he conceded this month he was no longer confident Covid-19 had developed naturally.\n\nMr Biden\u2019s statement comes the day after Xavier Becerra, US secretary for health and human services, urged the WHO to ensure a \u201ctransparent\u201d investigation into the virus\u2019s origins.\n\n\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic not only stole a year from our lives, it stole millions of lives,\u201d Mr Becerra said in an address to the World Health Assembly, a conference organised by the WHO.\n\n\u201cPhase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak.\u201d\n\nThe laboratory leak allegations were widely dismissed last year as a fringe conspiracy theory, after then-President Donald Trump said Covid-19 had originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Many US media outlets described such claims as debunked or false.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Trump sought to take credit in an emailed statement to the New York Post. \u201cTo me it was obvious from the beginning but I was badly criticised, as usual,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are all saying: \u2018He was right.\u201d",
