          "title": "Why 60% of Nigerian embassies are rented -Shehu Sani",
          "text": "Senator Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has underscored the need for an economic review of the dilapidated state of Nigerian Embassies abroad, to avoid colossal loss of foreign missions.\n\nSani, a former Deputy Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs in the eighth Senate, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja.\n\nHe spoke in reaction to complaints about the dilapidated state of Nigerian embassies abroad and its economic consequences to the country on funding repairs of such missions.\n\nHe observed Nigeria had been renting about 60 per cent of the nation\u2019s embassies abroad, saying such was costly in the face of ongoing challenges currently faced in the country.\n\n\u201cI found out that we have been renting about 60 per cent of Nigerian embassies abroad, some existed far back as 1960 and we are still unable to buy a house in those countries.\n\n\u201cFrom my observation, diplomatic staff have been fleecing this country in the name of paying rents; they prefer Nigeria to keep renting houses, rather than buying a building as an embassy.\n\n\u201cIn the past, everything about the embassy is in the Foreign Affairs ministry, but during the era of Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Ambassadors go to the Minister of Finance for them to be funded.\n\n\u201cAs such, it left the foreign affairs ministry with little or no choice on the embassy other than posting of diplomatic staff.\n\n\u201cEverything about the embassy should go back to the foreign affairs ministry; we should have targets, every year we should buy 10 buildings, so that in five to six years, we are no more renting.\u201d\n\nThe former lawmaker decried the embarrassment often caused by landlords in relation to rent issues.\n\nHe stressed the need to buy more diplomatic houses and to take stock of repairs of dilapidated Nigerian embassy buildings abroad, as measures to proffer a solution to the problem.\n\n\u201cThere are some buildings that we may not need; we have to trade them off and put those ones away.\n\n\u201cI learnt we have a residence for Nigeria\u2019s permanent representatives in New York and that residence has not been used for decades.\n\n\u201cIf that residence has not been used for decades, we have no reason to keep that building, we need to sell it off, use the proceeds and buy other properties in other countries.\u201d\n\nHe noted that buying good diplomatic buildings could cost as much as US$2 million, adding that such should be done to chart the way forward to safeguard Nigerian embassy operations abroad.",

          "text": "By Emma Amaize\n\nASABA \u2013 THE Delta- Ijaw 2023 Governorship Advocacy Group, DIGAG, in Delta State, Sunday, challenged leaders of Delta Central Senatorial District in the state canvassing zoning of governorship by Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, saying since 1998, the party had never zoned governorship in the state.\n\nThe group in a statement by the director general, Augustine Okporu, picked on the state PDP chairman, Barr. Kingsley Esiso and Deputy National Organizing Secretary, Chief Ighoyota Amori, who they accused of \u201cconstituting themselves as aspirants to the Delta state governorship primary election.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Police allegedly kill two students in Ilorin over cultists\u2019 rumpus\n\nExpressing lack of confidence in the two leaders, DIGAG urged the state governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, to \u201curgently call Esiso and Amori to order before they destroy the party,\u201d adding.\n\n\u201cThe two of them are occupying executive positions in the party which requires them to be neutral in all processes of elections within the PDP.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Delta state PDP chairman and the deputy national organizing secretary have chosen to throw their caps in the rings by openly canvassing for the interest of a particular senatorial district, the Delta Central senatorial district.\n\n\u201cBefore Chief Amori was elected as the deputy national organizing secretary, he was the chairman of the 2023 governorship lobby group by name, DC-23. Having being elected into the national office of this our great party, we thought that he would resign from his lobby group since they are canvassing for support for his Delta Central senatorial district.\n\n\u201cTo our utter dismay, Chief Amori is still seen leading his Urhobo people to negotiate for the unconstitutional zoning of the governorship office to his Delta Central senatorial district. He is now an unapologetic crusader of Urhobo people\u2019s governorship ambition in a race that other senatorial districts/tribes are also scheming to contest.\n\n\u201cIn a similar vein, Esiso who is the state chairman of the party has become the advocate of zoning of the governorship office to the Delta Central senatorial district. Esiso took such despotic adventure in flagrant violation of the known conventional practices in the state PDP.\n\n\u201cThe party has been in power since 1999 till date. There was no time a state party chairman has openly canvassed for the zoning of the party\u2019s office to a particular senatorial district. That is a sacrilegious act of impudence in breach of the oath of office and the ethical code of conduct in the party office.\n\n\u201cOn the 21st of January, 2022, Kingsley Esiso, while at the Delta state PDP caucus meeting moved a motion to zone the governorship office to the Delta Central senatorial district as if he was an ordinary party faithful.\n\n\u201cHis misguided motion would have torn the party in Delta state into shred if not the quick intervention of the governor of Delta state, Sen. Okowa.\n\n\u201cConsidering the partisan interest of Esiso and Amori in the Delta state PDP governorship primary, we fear the fortune of our party in 2023. To save the party in the state from the likely precipice, we call on the National Working Committee to immediately suspend Chief Ighoyota Amori from performing the functions of his office. His dual offices within the party amount to conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we also call on Governor Okowa to prevail on the State Working Committee of the party to immediately suspend Esiso as he has veered from his neutral position to become an interested governorship aspirants.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem whatsoever, if Esiso and Amori solicit for support for their Urhobo aspirants, but doing same with the toga of their offices is a serious violation of the party Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf PDP must survive in Delta state in the next elections, then Esiso and Amori should be relieved of their offices. It is on record that the Delta state PDP has never zoned the governorship office to any senatorial districts since the inception of this democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cThe office is always thrown open for the interested aspirants to contest. If there had been senatorial district zoning arrangements in the party, why then has the Delta Central people always participated in all the party governorship primaries from 1998 to date?\n\n\u201cChief Amori should tell the world why he canvassed for the support of Delta Central people in 2014 against the ambition of Delta North people if there had been senatorial district zoning in the state?\n\n\u201cRecords in the archives have clearly shown that Chief Amori was one of the strongest anti-zoning crusaders of the governorship office in 2014. He clearly displayed his opposition to the zoning by canvassing for vote for his Urhobo brother, Olorogun David Edevbie who is from Central. Why that same man is now making a vault face? The group said.",

          "title": "SERVICE CHIEFS: Why insecurity persists despite Irabor and co efforts \u2014 Wisdom, retired US Army colonel",
          "text": "BY GABRIEL ENOGHOLASE\n\nWisdom Osagiede Ogbeowemwenkon Osemwende is a retired officer who served in the United States (US) Army for over 29 years. Born and bred in Benin City, Wisdom rose to the rank of colonel in the world\u2019s strongest military before retiring. But in retirement, Osagiede says he is not tired as he wants to lead Nigeria if elected the President in 2023.\n\nIn this interview, the retired colonel explains his mission to Nigerians, explaining how he thinks this venture is possible for a Nigerian who has spent most of his working life abroad.\n\nHe also speaks on why insecurity persists in Nigeria despite efforts by Service Chiefs to contain terrorists, bandits and kidnappers.\n\nRetired Colonel Wisdom M. Osagiede Ogbeowemwenkon Osemwende isn\u2019t a person substantially known to Nigerians? Who is he?\n\nI grew up in Lagos where I went to primary school. I later went to secondary school in Benin City. After I travelled abroad, I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Business, Master\u2019s of Arts in Mass Communication and I will finish my PhD in Public Policy and Administration in March 2022.\n\nI spent the bulk of my working years in the US military. In fact, I got into the US military in 1987 and retired in 2016. During my time there, I journeyed across the field with countless leadership positions and operations across the world. Some of my most significant assignments in the US military were the expeditions in Iraq and my trips to several places around the world for humanitarian services.\n\nI also joined in the efforts to rebuild Iraq after the war. I worked in the US diplomatic missions in Uganda, the Central African Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nI was the first US officer to train the National Emergency Management Agency, known as NEMA in Nigeria when I was with the US Africa Command in Germany. I trained senior Nigerian military officers and senior civilian executives on disaster relief and pandemic response. As a civil affairs officer within the US military, I travelled across the world providing social services to populations.\n\nThese trips took me to orphanages and highly needy communities. I piloted the project for a network of Non-Governmental Organizations that converged on Iraq for post-war development efforts. I trained Iraqis on local governance.\n\nYou have lived most of your working life abroad \u2013 how much of Nigerian do you know?\n\nI have virtually lived all my working life abroad like you mentioned. However, I have always been actively present in Nigeria, as far as everything is concerned. Since I relocated, I have kept in touch with my country by visiting Nigeria every single year. I do not only travel home annually, I also make trips to different parts of Nigeria during my visit home. Nigerians know me, I have friends everywhere in the country and I have family here.\n\nI read Nigerian papers regularly, listen to Nigerian news on the radio and watch it on TV. I am abreast with the happenings in my country. Most importantly, I have always been involved in the development of Nigeria and have made frantic contributions to the social and economic growth of the country.\n\nI personally provide support to many families by way of paying school fees and the provision of some basic needs. I have always donated working tools to hard-working individuals to help grow their businesses, especially at the subsistence level.\n\nFor how long have you nursed the ambition of running for President in Nigeria?\n\nAs a little boy growing up quite close to my father, he emphasized the importance of education. He never failed to do so. My father was a civil servant in the colonial era. This probably explains why he was an unrepentant lover of education.\n\nHe would explain to me that with a sound background in education, I could easily become the number one executive officer in Nigeria. This encouragement stemmed from my interest in governance which I expressed each time I saw a member of the Nigerian government riding across the city. I soon noticed myself not only becoming familiar with these people but also nursing the ambition of getting into a position of leadership someday. However, it is after I had served in other capacities and retired that I decided to run for office for the first time.\n\nNigeria has a history of being run by military leaders \u2013 first, what is your take on having uniform people in power?\n\nThe military is not designed to rule or be in power. Its responsibility is to protect the territorial integrity of the country against enemy forces, both internally and externally. That does not, however, mean leaders who have military backgrounds are incompetent. Rather, military personnel have a strong foundation in administration.\n\nThe United States military is a great example of excellence in administration. If there is one thing I have benefitted more from the US military, it is good administration. While we are still serving, we are not meant to run for political office and get in power, even with great administrative skills. So, having retired from the military with these skills, I think the right place to exercise them is at the helm of the Nigerian administration.\n\nIn your own understanding, how would you describe Nigeria 50 years after independence?\n\nFifty years after independence, Nigeria still has a long way to go. The country has made frantic efforts in every area of life, including democracy. The fact that Nigeria can organize and run elections where the people elect their leaders and life moves on is a great achievement.\n\nThat Nigeria is the biggest economy on the continent is a fact we cannot take for granted. That we can point at some great road infrastructure and modern bridges is something to be proud of. In the past three decades, Nigeria has produced an amazing number of intellectuals, thanks to the country\u2019s enviable universities.\n\nThat should make every Nigerian a happy man. With a film industry that has helped to employ Nigerians and standing tall as the second employment sector, one can only raise their thump up. I can go on and on.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has not had the score we would have expected since gaining independence. We still have development issues such as poor farms to market roads, inadequate health infrastructure, poor maintenance culture and lack of classrooms and other learning materials in our schools. Socially, Nigeria still swims in poverty, unemployment, diseases and many other things I will be addressing in my campaign.\n\nThese issues you have raised, and perhaps more, have been highlighted by every presidential hopeful over the years. Yet, victorious ones have come to power, governed, and left without properly solving them. Why do you think there is stagnation?\n\nThe refusal to share notes is the root cause of stagnation. By that, I mean successive governments have preferred to start things all over and only implement their plans rather than continuing from where their predecessors ended.\n\nWhen you operate that way, you are indirectly rubbishing some good works already done. It is not everything about a previous administration that is bad. Governance and development are continuous \u2013 you simply continue from where your predecessor ended and your successor will go on from where you stopped.\n\nIsn\u2019t it one country, made up of one person, with one dream? America and other great nations believe strongly in the system of sharing notes \u2013 you explain what you have done, where you ended and hand over the tools for me to continue. I can start implementing my plans when I would have completed the work you didn\u2019t complete at the time you were leaving. That is how a country should be run.\n\nYou have declared your intention to contest for the presidency of Nigeria in 2023. Do you have the financial muscle?\n\nNot yet! I will declare that soon, but for now, I would want to say God will provide the finances required to take up and complete this journey. At this juncture, I can confidently say I\u2019m the most experienced aspirant in the race based on my experience in international interactions through the United States government.\n\nOn which platform do you want to actualize your aspiration, and have you registered as a member of the party?\n\nI would like to contest under the All Progressives Congress, APC, which is currently in power. I am joining APC because of the party\u2019s stability. Also, the party has been noted for bringing forth the necessary change that Nigeria had longed for. APC has righted the wrongs of the past and that inspires me a great deal.\n\nWhat do you say about the mode of selecting parties\u2019 candidates, direct or indirect primaries?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to monitor direct primaries, unlike the indirect. I\u2019m however very comfortable with direct primaries because everyone takes part in the process. It is more democratic.\n\nHow do you assess the defence & security situation of Nigeria against the backdrop of the fact that our Service Chiefs are one year old in office?\n\nThe security situation in Nigeria, from every indication, is a great concern of the current administration. The Chief of the Defense Staff, General Irabor, is a man of great honour \u2013 a gentlemen and hard worker. He is a defence professional I have trailed him since the days of Boko Haram. He put up a great performance in north-eastern Nigeria.\n\nI must applaud his good work and commitment to see the security situation of the country improve tremendously by the day. By the way, I would retain him when I get in the office. Nigeria is vast and to have the country\u2019s security under total control requires much work.\n\nHowever, what I would say with sincerity is that there is still much work to be done. The Nigerian military deserves far more than what it currently has. There is need for great motivation in terms of salaries and welfare package. That means pay rise needs to be an urgent assignment for the next administration.\n\nSecondly, the military in Nigeria needs to be equipped with up-to-date working tools. Thirdly, Nigeria needs a properly trained military, ready to deploy within 24 hours. Also, a high degree of discipline needs to be buttressed in the ranks of the military, plus other reforms. To achieve these, the military budget needs to be handsome. My years of experience in the world\u2019s most advanced and equipped military give me the audacity to make reforms in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is faced with insecurity problems with Boko Haram, banditry, kidnappers holding sway in different parts of the country. As a retired United States military officer, what is your advice to the Federal Government?\n\nThe Federal Government should modernize the military and security agencies. This can be done by recruiting more personnel as the strength of every military is also the number of men and women in the force. The military should be restructured. Also, by providing adequate and more strategic training, the men in uniform could handle these crises in a more apt manner. The Nigerian military should be furnished with state-of-the-art equipment. It would certainly perform better with an improved welfare package. The security budget also needs to be inflated.\n\nThe Federal Government recently acquired the American made Tucano fighter jets. Do you think this can change the tide of the war?\n\nI\u2019m quite familiar with the Tucano which is also known as A-29. It uses a turbo engine. It flies low and aims at its target. It can operate two missions \u2013 as a fighter jet and conducting reconnaissance operations. The Tucano is excellent on rough terrains. You know, Tucano can only provide the results if the soldiers using it are adequately trained. So, Nigerian soldiers need to be trained to the extent whereby a private soldier can request air support from the mission station and the former will not be referred to the higher headquarters. In the U.S, a private soldier can request air support during combat operations and get it within five minutes at the grid coordinate.\n\nTell us about the Nigeria Police and your vision.\n\nA country with a strong internal security setup is a successful country. The Nigeria Police, I would say, are far more advanced than those of other countries in Africa, but it is not where it should be today. There is a dire need for a lot of improvement. First, the Nigeria Police need pay rise as a matter of urgency.\n\nMost of the problems that have pinned this corps to the ground stemmed from inadequate pay. The police should not appear as a beggarly corps. It is not only a respectable profession, but officers are men and women who should feel proud to protect the citizens of their country. For them to function properly, they need to be motivated with a better welfare package. Also, and most importantly, I will abolish the barracks and implement community policing. That is my vision for the Nigeria Police.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has been reliant on the petroleum sector for a while. Is that where your heart beats more?\n\nSurprising no! My focus will be agriculture.\n\nNigeria has not exploited this sector sufficiently, whereas it is potentially the country\u2019s economic solution. We need to get back to the farms and produce food and cash crops. Nigeria has the soil, and we can cultivate crops that can be exported with a comfortable return on investment for the country\u2019s economy.\n\nWe will embark on mechanized agriculture as well and provide financial and material support to farmers. My administration will encourage the South-East region to get fully involved in manufacturing agricultural machinery.\n\nTell us about your plans to improve the health sector.\n\nWe will start by working assiduously on health infrastructure. We will set up health centers in most villages across the country. There will be centralized clinics for small communities. The existing infrastructure will be improved upon. My administration will introduce a well-organized and affordable health insurance policy across Nigeria.\n\nThere will be free medical treatment for Nigerians who cannot afford it. I will leverage this from my experience in the United States.\n\nNigeria, just like other African countries, is made up of different ethnic groups. It is not all the time that these groups interact peacefully. In fact, the country has witnessed some ethnic clashes in the past, some of which have been bloody. What is your provision for ethnic division?\n\nFirst, I will organize a high-level summit for leaders of the three major tribes in Nigeria, the Yoruba, the Igbo, the Hausa and Fulani. Discussions at this summit will focus on ways they can live together convivially. My administration will encourage patriotism and let people know they are Nigerians and only belong to Nigeria.\n\nThey must have the country at heart. It is by loving each other that they will love Nigeria. We want Nigerians to see themselves as Nigerians and not as Yoruba, Igbo, Hausas and Fulani.\n\nWhat will be your major areas of focus if elected President?\n\nI will be very strong on defence and security. I plan to organize an economic and security summit with the United States government if elected. At this summit, we will request the United States\u2019 help in modernizing livestock which will be beneficial to the Fulani. This would replace the nomadic way of grazing that appears to cause a lot of security problems.\n\nThis and many more I would do with the US will improve and strengthen the relationship between both countries. Every Nigeria shall be free to move about and carry out their duties. This can only happen when there is total security.\n\nTo that effect, security will be my major focus. I will face security head-on and make it difficult for intruders to beat the system. To fight against terrorism, I will erect a wall along Nigerian borders. There will only be a one-way in and a one-way out of Nigeria. This, I believe, will make things difficult for terrorists who move out of the country, train, and return to wreak havoc. Rest assured that Boko Haram will cease to exist once I get in office. My inspiration here is General Collin Powell\u2019s war doctrine which will be forced on terrorists and bandits.\n\nYou can refer to my July 14, 2013 interview with Vanguard newspaper. I will pay very close attention to defence. I will be very involved in the defence of Nigeria. My administration will combat poverty by introducing programs that will eliminate suffering. We will also focus on education by providing free schooling at the primary and secondary levels. Identification of Nigerians is primordial, so we will ensure that everyone has an ID card.\n\nWe will support those who cannot afford it. Meanwhile, we will create a national database for identification cards where biometric fingerprints will help us detect criminals.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "\u2018Why it\u2019s difficult to invest in Southeast\u2019",
          "text": "Most Igbo businessmen are not investing in the Southeast because doing business there is more difficult than any other region, the Managing Director of FIT Consult Limited, operators of HELIU Residences, Chief Loretta Aniagolu has stated.\n\nAniagolu was addressing a team of architects from the Enugu State chapter of Nigerian Institute of Architects as well as student architects from various tertiary institutions in Enugu\n\non an education tour of HELIU Estate, located along the Enugu-Port-Harcourt Expressway in Enugu.\n\nShe said investing in such businesses as real estates and large scale industries, attracts lots of frustrating hiccups.\n\nAccording to her, a combination of state governments\u2019 insensitive financial charges and communal constant disturbances discourage such investors.\n\nAniagolu however admitted that Enugu State and Southeast has highest return on investments with the highest rate appreciation rate of property in the entire country.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nShe said: \u201cNobody knows why it\u2019s like that, but I think it has to do with the sentiments of the Igbos in owning property in Enugu.\n\n\u201cSo you find out that the minimium appreciation rate of property in Enugu is 100 per cent annually.\n\n\u201cFor instance, these bungalows \u2013 when we built them , we sold them for N8.5m for three bedrooms. But today, people are selling them N20m. I can\u2019t even believe it but that\u2019s the reality and it\u2019s shocking because the houses were just sold in 2019. So that tells you something about the appreciation rate in this place; not even Lagos has this kind of high appreciation rate.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the first District we\u2019re developing in the Southeast. We have not done any project in the southeast. We\u2019ve done in the North. We\u2019ve done in Zamfara. We\u2019ve done in Taraba. We\u2019ve done in the Southsouth\u201d.\n\nShe however lamented Southeast is a very difficult place to \u201cdo this kind of business. In fact, now that we\u2019re doing it , we know the reason some people are not really doing some investments in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cIndeed, it Is a very difficult place to do business. It\u2019s extremely difficult to do business here, and I have to be honest with you.\n\n\u201cFor people who have funds and they are accusing a lot of the Igbos who invested in Lagos, in the West, North and so on.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the way they are going to treat you and the way they are willing to bend over backward to try and bring you into their space, you won\u2019t have options but to do business with them.\n\n\u201cBut here, after you battle in the Southeast, you won\u2019t do another project there; that\u2019s even when they\u2019re using your own money, too.\n\n\u201cIn most other parts of the Southeast, when you want to do a project, you actually have to pay the entire money to government on their land upfront.\n\n\u201cThis(Enugu) is one of the few times we worked with a state governor and they said ok, pay us part of the money as we work along. And so we have an arrangement \u2013 they take a share of what you have as they go along instead of saying pay us the entire N4billion upfront.\n\n\u201cSo when you are a developer, if they give you bush, you have to provide light, road, water, which is the job of the government. In addition to that, they estimate what you are doing based on an assumption that you have already done it and they charge you as if to say it\u2019s done but meanwhile you\u2019re still in the middle of the bush.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a very difficult place to work. Also, the communities don\u2019t make things easy. As soon as the communities see somebody coming in \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve invested over $15million so far \u2013 and we haven\u2019t borrowed money yet\u201d.",

          "text": "By Cosmas Omegoh (Lagos), Gyang Bere (Jos), Femi Folaranmi (Yenagoa), and Emmanuel Adeyemi (Lokoja)\n\nIn few months\u2019 time , the electoral process will start running in full swing. Then politicians will launch into electioneering, jostling to win the electorate and their votes. The potpourri of political activities will set the polity buzzing; tension will follow; anxiety will be running over. All sights, all thoughts will focus on the elections and 2023.\n\nBut what about insecurity \u2013 the nemesis many believe is currently ruling every inch of the Nigerian space like a leviathan? Has anyone given a thought to how it might shape the colour of things to come?\n\nWhat are some of the realities of insecurity in the country today?\n\nFindings showed that in the country now, many are ruled by high-level fear. Fear of bandits and banditry, political thugs and thugery, insurgents and insurgency, agitators and agitation, herders and their bloodletting. Then of kidnappers.\n\nAt the moment, there is a sustained orgy of banditry and mindless killing in the Northwest. And the activities of Boko Haram and ISWAP in the Northeast still remain a serious threat. Pockets of the insurgents have drifted to the North-central. There, they have established various terror cells; sacked villages and taken over territories from the government, imposing their own taxes, while mowing down innocent citizens. Then there are marauding herdsmen driving the natives far from their fields and ancestral homelands in Plateau and Benue states in particular. Then in the Southeast, the activities of IPOB/ESN are there; the South-south and Southwest zones too have their own fair share of the problem. The wind of violence is blowing everywhere \u2013 gusty without any let up or so it seems.\n\nDisappointed over insecurity\n\nFormer member of the House of Representatives representing Plateau State, Hon Bitrus Kaze, is aghast that the country is having a rough patch under the Muhammadu Buhari presidency.\n\n\u201cWe have never gone this badly, and this should tell Nigerians that people who raised our hope and trust in 2015 have demonstrated to us the stuff they are made up of. If they themselves couldn\u2019t handle our security, how can they bring people that will handle our security in 2023?\u201d he queried, lamenting that \u201cfor this to be happening under President Muhammadu Buhari, a retired military head of state, is disturbing and worrisome.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, another former House member, Hon Bolous Sylva Indiamowei who represented Yenagoa/ Kolokuma/ Opokuma between 2003 and 2007 said that the state of insecurity and the grinding poverty in the country might push the country to the edge.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria might be at the crossroads in 2023 because of the general elections, but expressed optimism that God would rescue the country.\n\n\u201cElection year is always turbulent in Nigeria. The general state of insecurity is a source of concern, so also the economic situation.\n\n\u201cForget about the figures the various agencies are churning out, there is widespread poverty in the country. And I am sure the president is aware of the real situation.\n\n\u201cThese two issues put together affect the society and could push Nigeria to the crossroads such that we might have to be on our knees to pray to God to rescue the country.\u201d\n\nA security analyst, Ben Okezie, echoed that \u201cright now, the security agencies are overwhelmed,\u201d emphasising that \u201ceven the president is overwhelmed. Short and simple!\n\n\u201cWhy are the security personnel overwhelmed? Simple! They are not being adequately taken care of.\n\n\u201cNow, look at the ISWAP. They have good hands, with retired security personnel all over the world joining them. Now, they are in Niger and Zamfara states collecting taxes and installing emirs. They don\u2019t sleep, but it looks like our own security agencies are sleeping. With their presence in those places how do you conduct elections?\u201d\n\nInsecurity has been there for long\n\nBut not everyone believes the level of insecurity in the land is such a big deal to hold back the hand of things.\n\nAfter all, Nigeria has been expressing similar challenges all along.\n\nFormer All Progressives Congress (APC) chairman, Enugu State chapter, Dr Ben Nwoye believes that \u201cinsecurity has been there much longer before now,\u201d although he admits it is a little bit \u201cwidespread\u201d today. He also believes the situation has come to stay, adding that \u201cit is a global issue.\u201d\n\nHe is optimistic this \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to stop the country from moving forward,\u201d as it can be contained.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Kogi State governor on Water Resources, Alhaji Yahaya Ade Ismail, also believes that the 2023 general election will be peaceful despite the security challenges. He, however, called for \u201cfairness, justice and equity across the party lines.\u201d\n\nHe is of the view that \u201cif all the state governors will work hard to secure their own states, there will be no fear of any security threat.\u201d\n\nLet elections hold\n\nEven while Nigerians battle with insecurity in the land, they stand united that elections have to hold as scheduled.\n\nDr Nwoye and others want the 2023 general elections to go on unhindered. According to him, \u201cthere is no need saying that because of insecurity, we should all vamoose.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, there was insecurity, yet elections held. Recently, governorship election held in Anambra State amid all the noise and hoopla.\n\n\u201cIt is the job of the government to fight insecurity and ensure that our democratic process continues.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that in 2014, Boko Haram insurgents were at their heights in the Northeast, yet elections were conducted. He, therefore, wants the country \u201cto borrow from such experience.\u201d\n\nFor ex-lawmaker, Kaze, \u201cthe question on the minds of many Nigerians in view of the degenerating situation is whether there will be elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cBut the point is that for anybody to contemplate not holding election in 2023 should not be an option. Holding elections in 2023 is a matter that cannot be compromised.\u201d\n\nSecurity experts express fears\n\nBut experts in security matters are expressing fears.\n\nSecurity analyst, Ben Okezie, is afraid that already the insecurity in the land presents a gloomy picture.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe is emphatic that if the situation persists with no conscious efforts at stopping it doom might follow.\n\n\u201cAfter my thorough analysis of the situation,\u201d he says, \u201cmy conclusion is that the security situation ahead of 2023 elections looks gloomy.\n\n\u201cFirst, the military came out to say that they discovered some people were putting on military uniforms for political purposes. That shows you that the bad boys will be out there to cause harm at elections time.\n\n\u201cIt follows that if some people are wearing security personnel\u2019s uniforms, they must also be armed. Now, we can see the number of arms that were alleged to have disappeared from the police amoury unaccounted for?\n\n\u201cNow, consider that a former military head of state General Abdulsalami Abubakar alleged that over six million illegal weapons are in various hands. So, what we are saying now is that there is so much illegal arms in the hands of non-state actors and our security agencies do not know in whose hands those arms are.\u201d\n\nIt is his considered view that \u201cwith what we are going on now, it might not be palatable for the country, especially the security agencies.\u201d\n\nHe went on to outline the developments which point to the danger he sees ahead.\n\n\u201cLook at the killings everywhere, even in places where one doesn\u2019t expect such. Look at the killing of an Oba in Ogun State. Look at what is happening in Zamfara, Plateau, Imo, Katsina and Kaduna states. Look at violence everywhere. All these are clear pointers to what to expect when the elections come.\u201d\n\nLet govt mop up illegal arms\n\nAhead of the elections, Okezie wants all \u201csecurity agencies to as a matter of urgency begin now to mop up illegal arms in every local government in the country. And who are the ones to help them? Retired security agents \u2013 the army, police, DSS.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t mop up all the illegal arms, we are just joking. Arms speak power everywhere. Everything should be done about this; they should be fast about it. Once arms are out of the way, our security agencies can handle every other challenge. Arm in the arms of a child is dangerous. But if he doesn\u2019t have that, you can draw his ears and ask him to kneel down and he obeys.\u201d\n\nRichard Amuwa former secretary, Association of Licenced Private Security Practitioners of Nigeria insists \u201cthe insecurity situation we have at the moment is a major challenge.\u201d\n\nAmuwa who works with Mega Guards Services Ltd says he has observed that insecurity during elections in Nigeria follow a trend.\n\n\u201cInsecurity has always been part of our challenges, and has continued to be so. One hopes it wouldn\u2019t go higher than what we have at the moment.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that because in \u201cevery election year, we always have loud talks about insecurity and how it is going to be. But I don\u2019t exercise any fear, although I know that insecurity presently is a major challenge.\u201d\n\nHowever, he expressed fears that \u201cif something else is added to it, that will be a huge disaster.\u201d\n\nLets recruit more security personnel\n\nRecruitment of more staff for various security outfits, for Dr Nwoye, is the way right way to go in addressing the situation at hand right now.\n\n\u201cWe need to recruit more security personnel. From my experience, our security numbers are abysmal compared to our population. Something has to be done about this. The number of policemen and other security agencies cannot police what is going on now. And so, what we have now has to change. Government has to look at recruitment and training of new officers.\u201d\n\nAllow citizens bear arms\n\nDr Nwoye suggested that the government allows the citizenry to bear arms and defend themselves.\n\nHis words: \u201cOn the alternative, let\u2019s consider what Governor Aminu Masari has said. If it becomes clear that we don\u2019t have enough personnel to defend us as a nation, then allow the people to procure their own arms. There is no reason criminals would be running around and killing people in cold blood while law-abiding citizens remain defenceless \u2013 all because we don\u2019t have enough personnel to defend us.\n\n\u201cLet there be more talks on private citizens legally obtaining arms to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, he advised politicians going on their campaigns to be very careful.\n\n\u201cBut how careful can you be?\u201d he asked, adding \u201cthat\u2019s where we have come to be.\u201d\n\nHow private security agent can help\n\nIn Amuwa\u2019s opinion, government can leverage on hundreds of private securities agencies in the country to fight insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe have over five million guards. Government can find a way to work with them. They can supply information to our security agencies and that will be a good collaborative effort.\n\n\u201cInsecurity happens in every community. If there is a guard in a community, and they see people gathering with arms, they can always report.\n\n\u201cBut we have a situation where the security personnel are not working with private security personnel; that is not very good,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic education very important\n\nAmuwa is also of the opinion that \u201cwe need to educate the citizenry on what to do when the politicians come up with their crazy stuffs.\u201d\n\nHe said that \u201cwe need to educate our communities to stay safe because arms proliferation, use of thugs \u2013 all of them will constitute insecurity challenges in 2023.\u201d\n\nHis sentiments were shared by Hon Kaze who also expressed the need to \u201cspeak to our people; we should speak to Nigerians because the insecurity level we have now is intolerable; this government has failed us; they have failed much more than every other government before now, civilian or military.\u201d",

          "title": "Controversy trails Abuja rice pyramid show",
          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen, Olakunle Olafioye (Lagos) and John Adams (Minna)\n\nIt was a moment of joy in the penultimate week as the Federal Government unveiled the Central Bank of Nigeria/RIFAN Paddy Pyramids in Abuja.\n\nNigerians who saw the heaps of rice were happy. Since then, many have started saying goodbye to hunger, which has become common in many households in the country. The new hope is that local rice will soon flood the Nigerian markets. But that may be a pipe dream as there are many who despite the cheers and new hope believe that the Abuja rice show was a scam\n\nSenator Hanga Rufai is one of the stakeholders in rice production in Kano State. Speaking with Sunday Sun in a telephone interview, he dismissed the unveiling of the rice pyramid in Abuja as a scam.\n\nAccording to him, the bulk of the rice they showcased was imported from the neighbouring countries to augment the small quantity produced locally in Nigeria so that they could cover up the money they have stolen from the Anchor Borrower Programme.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a scam. In a situation where bandits did not allow people to go to the farms, how could they have produced such a huge quantity of rice they showcased? Even where the bandits allowed farmers to farm, they didn\u2019t allow them to harvest. In some cases, they went and razed their farms with fire. Not up to 20 per cent of our land last year and the year before was cultivated because of this banditry that is all over the Northwest.\n\n\u201cIt is a scam because the Anchor Borrowers coordinators were stealing the money. The arrangement is for the farmers to produce rice commensurate with the money given to them, but at the end of the farming season, the coordinators of the Anchor Borrowers programme were seen running helter-skelter looking for rice to buy both internally and from foreign countries so much that a bag of rice which was hitherto sold for N10,000 went up to about N17,000 in the market. So, the rice they showcased was not actually produced in Nigeria, the bulk of it was imported from neighbouring countries like Niger, Benin Republic, and Burkina Faso.\n\n\u201cKano is one of the largest producers of rice in Nigeria, we know what happened. We were there physically when they were buying rice in the market. There was production of rice, but not to the volume they showcased. If they said they produced one million tons, I am sure they did not produce up to 1000 tons.\n\n\u201cI have a large farm but didn\u2019t have enough money to produce. So, I saw the Anchor Borrowers programme as an opportunity and showed interest to borrow. They featured thousands of us, but eventually, they gave about 100 of us. Each person got one bag of manure, one sprayer, a container of chemical, which was largely water, and one bag of fertilizer. I saw it as a scam and returned the items.\n\n\u201cThe input they provided for farmers was for subsistence farming and the money they released did not reach the farmers because the leaders of the Anchor Borrowers programme stole the money. Before the former Minister of Agriculture was fired, I went to him and advised him to report the matter to the CBN, but he refused. Eventually, the president sacked him.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a scam. And you know that our man (Mr President) takes anything they tell him. But Nigerians know that this is a scam. The very poor people of this country know that they didn\u2019t produce this rice pyramid. If it was produced here in Nigeria, how did a bag of rice jump from N10,000 to N28,000 or N29,000 during Christmas? So, the ordinary people were competing with them (leaders of Anchor Borrowers Programme) to buy rice in the market.\n\n\u201cThe programme should have been run by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with the states. That way, there would be competition among states. But at the end of it all, everything turned out to be a scam. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, rice dealers in some parts of Lagos State have criticized the Federal Government over its claim of availability of locally grown rice in the country, describing the claim as false and misleading. Some of the traders who spoke to Sunday Sun said the pictures of rice pyramid which the government boasted so much about was not real.\n\nWhen Sunday Sun correspondent visited some areas in the state, including Agege, Ipaja, Alagbado and Ogba, most dealers claimed that they did not have local rice in their stores while the few who had said they only have limited supplies and offered to sell it at marginally cheap price compared to foreign rice.\n\nA dealer in Alagbado area of the state, Joel Oganiru, told Sunday Sun that a bag of locally grown rice costs 26,500 while the same quantity of foreign rice sold for between N27, 800 and N29, 000.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cI have less than one bag (of locally grown rice) at the moment but if you would like to buy half a bag it is N13, 250. A bag sells for N26, 500,\u201d Oganiru said.\n\nThe dealer also confirmed that he had equally seen the purported rice pyramid on social media but said there was scarcity of the brand the last time he tried to replenish his stock. \u201cMay be they have not shipped it to Lagos,\u201d he reasoned.\n\nThe story was not different at Agege and Ipaja-Ayobo area of the state where another rice dealer had to make three different calls to his fellow dealers before he was able to ascertain the availability of the local brand of the rice which he offered to sell at N26, 800 per bag and on the condition that the correspondent would have to wait for about 30 minutes before the product would be brought to his shop.\n\nIn Niger State, only 20 per cent of the N6.5 billion given out to farmers in Niger State under the Central Bank of Nigeria Anchor Borrowers loan being jointly supervised by the apex bank and Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) have so far been recovered from rice farmers in the state.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2019, the CBN through RIFAN, Niger State chapter, approved and disbursed the said amount as loans to 32,500 rice farmers in the state.\n\nThis loan, according to the Chairman of RIFAN in the state, Mallam Idris Abini were given in form of farmer implements and equipment, ranging from water pumps and accessories, rice seeds, sprayers, fertilizers, pre-emergency herbicides and post-emergency herbicides.\n\nHe revealed that the 20 per cent loan recovered so far in the state was made possible by the new policy introduced by CBN to appoint an individual as coordinator between the RIFAN, CBN and the farmers, and all farm inputs and equipment would be channelled through the person.\n\nHe pointed out that all the 32,500 beneficiaries of the loan in the state were made to pay 20 per cent of items given to them as equity through the coordinator, who served as a guarantor, adding that the policy was introduced by the CBN in 2019 when the farmers refused to pay back their loan.\n\n\u201cAll items were given to the coordinator, who served as guarantor between the farmers, CBN and RIFAN. That policy has kept the programme going since 2019 till date. The CBN in its wisdom decided not to shut the door on Niger State because of her potential in rice production so it introduced the policy, and an individual was appointed to be in-charge of special RIFAN projects.\n\nExplaining implementation modality of the new policy, Abini said: \u201cAll the inputs will be given to the Coordinator based on the number of registered farmers under him and they pay 20 per cent of the value of the items given to them as equity.\u201d\n\nHe added that since the policy was introduced in 2019, about N195 million had been recovered from about 9,500 farmers who have benefited from the loan.\n\nHowever, due to the policy and commitment towards the loan repayment shown by the state RIFAN since 2019, as contained in it reports recently presented to the National Headquarters of RIFAN, the state is being considered for the dry season funding.\n\nAbini said about 65,000 hectares of rice farms is being cultivated by farmers in the state every year, producing an estimated 260,000 metric tons of rice in the state.\n\nHe, therefore, attributed the current high cost of the commodity to hoarding by the middlemen who want to exploit Nigerians and paint the present administration in a bad light of not doing enough in the area of rice production, stressing that \u201cit is purely act of sabotage by some few individuals.\u201d",

          "title": "President I want for Nigeria in 2023 \u2013Prof Tunde Adeniran",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nRenowned academic and tactical politician, Prof Tunde Adeniran, was former Minister of Education, former Ambassador of Nigeria to Germany, as well as the chairman of the defunct Directorate for Social Mobilization (MAMSER).\n\nHe was also a former member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before his defection to the Social Democratic Party in 2018.\n\nHe left partisan politics in 2020, after serving as the national chairman of the SDP, a position he took over from Chief Olu Falae (former finance minister and presidential candidate).\n\nIn this exclusive chat with Sunday Sun, the celebrated scholar, spoke on critical national issues, including delay in electoral bill, petroleum subsidy, zoning and the president that Nigeria needs in 2023. Excerpt:\n\nLatest Transparency International (TI) report on corruption index on Nigeria is again damning. What is your reaction to it?\n\nI believe the report is worrisome, it shows that we still have a long way to go and unless we tackle it head-on, it will continue to haunt us and we need to be very decisive about our national policy or determination to fight corruption because it is all over the place, in the political, the economy, in fact, in all areas of our national life. We really need to tackle it and what is worrisome about it is that when you see the younger generation not giving much hope and thinking that that has become a way of life then that becomes more disturbing. So, I think it is an issue we really need to tackle head-on. It is something that we can conquer; we can put an end to it if we are so determined. It means that we have to work it out together within our various systems, dealing with it in our daily life, in our public and private life. We need to deal with it because if we don\u2019t deal with it, it will not go away on its own.\n\nWhat do we really need to do? Is it that the culprits do not receive appropriate punishment?\n\nThat is part of what I mean because it is becoming increasingly fashionable for people who have been alleged to have cheated the public or an institution to feel that it is something normal and some even celebrate it, giving impression that it is a show of, look, we have become big men. It is really a tragedy because they believe that when they do it they will go away with it and they do it with impunity, but if they are well sanctioned, if adequately punished there will be an end to it. When they are really sanctioned and the courts do not adjoin endlessly and without coming up with judgments that are ridiculous, then things will gradually begin to fall in line. Once justice is done and offenders are made to face the music, then it will serve as deterrent to others.\n\nThere is this issue of Electoral Act being delayed. Are you worried?\n\nI do not believe that the Electoral Act should take as much time as it is taking to have its finality. When people begin to see this type of delay it gives a signal that there is something wrong somewhere, maybe that some people are trying to play games, maybe that some people are trying to manipulate to favour their political lining etc. We should not be doing things in such a way that every situation creates tension. Nigeria does not deserve all this, it is most unfortunate this is something that is so straightforward that ought to have been handled with transparency and decisiveness, and there is no need for all these rigmarole.\n\nAlready, there is a parade of presidential hopeful from the different political parties for the 2023 presidential battle. Are you satisfied with the stuff you have seen so far?\n\nSo far I am not particularly satisfied because I believe that this country has a lot of human resources. We are not just endowed with mineral resources alone, God in His mercy gave this country a lot of materials, in terms of human resources and they should come out and serve this country. The more the merrier, once the people see many more people with the capacity to turn things around for better in this country joining the race they will have confidence that the future indeed will be better than today. So, we are expecting that more people will definitely come out to join the race so that the people will be able to make more informed choices based on their antecedents, based on their vision, based on their capacity, their competence and, of course, based on their ability to understand and appreciate what is on ground and what it will take to turn things around for Nigerians and the Nigerian nation.\n\nNigerian politics today seem to be a struggle between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Do we really need a Third Force if there must be something different?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nI believe what has been lacking all along is the absence of an ideologically-rooted party, a party that is based on clear ideology. When you talk about the APC and the PDP today being the dominant party, yes they are dominant, yet at the same time people are walking in and out of both parties because there is no difference. That is why today you can hardly tell in some cases who belongs to which party. Today, you think they are in the APC, tomorrow you discover they are not. There is no clear-cut ideological distinction between those two parties; they are just mere vehicles for winning positions. What is different is just the name, but people within those parties in terms of their philosophy and ideological orientation there is no difference.\n\nThe government has shifted subsidy removal to another 18 months, while some say it\u2019s victory for Nigerians; some are of the view that its postponement of the doomsday. What is your view on it?\n\nWell, if some people see it as the extension of the doomsday they have their reasons. I think it is really unfortunate that you cannot do some things and get positive result or effect out of it unless you sacrifice some other good things also. It should be possible to remove the subsidy and at the same time not having the type of negative consequences that people anticipate and which ordinarily and normally will also happen, simply because we have not put in place measures that will address the consequences of subsidy removal. Subsidy, it has been stated over and over that it is a fraud, it is fraudulent, it is a rip-off of the Nigerian people and the Nigerian nation, so it has been carefully thought out that it is time to remove it, but yet, it cannot be removed now because if you do the burden will also be burn by the people who have all along been suffering from the subsidy. Money that should be used to develop the communities, build infrastructure, improve the quality of life of the people are being siphoned to the so-called subsidy. So, it\u2019s most unfortunate, but one believes that okay, let them enjoy another era of the subsidy within when Nigeria will be liberated from it. I believe it cannot continue forever, so it has to go.\n\nWhat exactly is your take on zoning concerning the country today and the different strategies from different zones? Do you have sympathy for any zone to take the presidency in 2023?\n\nWell, anybody has a right to be strategizing to become anything; it depends on the value of the various parties and then their orientation, which direction they want to go. One thing I have said which I believe in is that we have to think more of people with competence, people with capacity, people who know what it will take to turn things around for this country. Within that context you know that when you look at any zone you get some competent people. At the same time, you look and say okay because of the mood of the country you cannot just say okay some people have done it and that let them just continue because they are competent and all that. People feel or think that there should be a shift and then this shift will also be based on not just any character, like some of the people that we are getting now. We have to get people that Nigerians will have confidence in, those they can trust. People that can deliver, people that will represent competence, people that will represent a new change for the Nigerian people and the Nigerian nation, a new direction. I am resolute and committed to having an ideologically-oriented leadership that will be able to lead this country out of the woods.\n\nThere is this speculation in the political circle that your party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) is one of the parties that will provide platform for National Consultative Front (NCFront)\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) I don\u2019t belong to any political party now. I left partisan politics since 2020, when I resigned as the national chairman, of the Social Democratic Party. Since then, I am not a member of any political party, but I belong to the group, the orientation that believes that we need to get this country on a very solid base and to do this we need a strong ideology that will be people-oriented.\n\nWhat is your take on the security challenge in the country?\n\nI am not happy and I am not satisfied with what is on ground in terms of security. The protection of lives and property is the first and most important responsibility of any government. I believe that we can do much more. A number of steps are being taken by the government, but I believe that we need to do much more. We should create the type of environment that will mobilise the entire nation to ensure an end to this insecurity. By that I mean that those who will work and ensure that we are all secured are not just the military, not just the police or the security agencies, but each and every one of us must have to be involved in it at different levels. It means that all of us will be able to make meaningful contributions to securing ourselves, protecting ourselves and all that. When you go to some countries, by the time you land as a visitor, tourist or whoever, they know that you are there and you are monitored here and there. In Nigeria today anybody comes in and goes out, so many things happen, people are trooping in with weapons of destruction, our people are being murdered and massacred here and there, abduction takes place on a daily basis, school children can no longer go to school for fear of being kidnapped, people cannot be on their farms for fear of being kidnapped, people are in their houses they cannot sleep well because they don\u2019t know what will happen next. That is not good. That should end. In the present situation, people are living in fear and this is not in any way good for our country. Without peace and good security, development cannot take place in an environment of insecurity.\n\nWhat kind of leadership do we need, and one that Nigerians should vote for in 2023?\n\nI want Nigerians to go for a leader that has the clear vision as to where Nigeria should go, who understands the entire dynamics of this country. A leader who will be able to unite the Nigerian people, a leader who will recognise our shortcomings and our goals and be decisive in solving those shortcomings, in resolving the crisis of basic trust among various groups in the country. we need one who will address the issues of not just insecurity, but mass unemployment, particularly among the young people. A person that will adequately address the issue of economic gaps which is a very serious one and, of course, the issue of justice and equity and development so that people will feel proud and happy that they are Nigerians, that there is no second class citizens in this country and that there is no marginalisation anymore and that people can achieve their ultimate goal because they are Nigerians.\n\nIn this choice, you think age should not be a barrier or should it?\n\nAs far as I am concerned you get to a point whereby you should not aspire for such an office that is so demanding, in terms of the energy needed. For instance, you cannot see or hear me saying again that I want to be president of this country because of the physical exertion that will be required. Of course, everybody has the right to come forward as far as you fall within the constitutional requirement, but I think the younger the better and not only that, it will be better when you have people with vision, capacity, commitment and the right orientation. But we should not also write-off people based on their age, we must consider antecedents and other factors to make informed choices.",

          "text": "\u2022$3.54bn joint venture debts offset since 2016\n\n\u2022$1.143bn still outstanding\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) paid an additional cash call arrears of $452,535,270 to its joint venture (JV) partners between November 2020 and November 2021, bringing to $3.54 billion the total debts it paid to the international oil companies (IOCs) since 2016, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nNew data from the national oil company indicated that among the five International Oil Companies (IOCs) being owed the backlog, Mobil Nigeria Producing and Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) had been fully settled as of November 31, 2021.\n\nThe figures gleaned from the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for January 2022, revealed that the two oil majors got a total of $833.7 million and $1.097 billion, respectively, since the arrears repayments started in 2016.\n\nHowever, a THISDAY analysis of the data showed that the NNPC still has an outstanding balance of $1.143 billion, according to the latest data, out of the negotiated total debt of $4.689 billion with the Joint Venture (JV) partners over five years ago.\n\nAside from Mobil and Chevron, other oil majors that are being owed arrears by the NNPC include Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Total Energies and Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC).\n\nWhile the SPDC has been paid $680.6 million so far, with an outstanding $691.9 million out of the initial $1.37 billion owed, Total as of November 31, 2021, had been paid $411.73 million with a balance of $199.2 million, out of total debt of $610.97 million.\n\nFurthermore, with an initial debt of $774.6 million owed NAOC, payment to date made to the oil company was $522.6 million, with an outstanding of $252 million.\n\nThe NNPC, in 2016, signed a cash call repayment agreement with its JV partners to defray cash-call arrears within five years after many years of its indebtedness to its partners.\n\nBefore then it had consistently for years failed to meet its indebtedness to the IOCs, a situation the operators said caused loss of new investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAt the time, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources had negotiated a discount with the IOCs, comprising SPDC, Total, Mobil, Chevron and Agip from about $5.1 billion down to $4.68 billion and had since then continued to reduce the debt payments in instalments.\n\nThe NNPC further explained that in the case of SPDC, repayment was from the price balance distribution on Project Santolina; while in the case of CNL, repayment was from price balance distribution on Projects Cheetah and Falcon.\n\n\u201cNNPC has fully repaid its cash call arrears to MPN and all incremental barrels have reverted to base,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe cash call arrangements, under which NNPC had to pay for its 55 per cent to 60 per cent share of investment in the upstream joint ventures, had been in place for over 40 years before it was restructured.\n\nRecently, President Muhammadu Buhari had declared that the reforms initiated by his administration in 2015 when he took office, including the JV renegotiations, succeeded in saving the oil and gas industry in the country from total collapse.\n\nBuhari noted that, for instance, the payments of huge cash call backlog owed the country\u2019s JV partners took off a huge burden from the NNPC, saying that the current transparency drive in the national oil company was a product of those critical restructurings.\n\nThe president lamented that the sector which accounts for a huge source of foreign exchange for Nigeria, was in dire straits when he took over.\n\n\u201cWhen we were elected into office in 2015, the industry was in a very dire situation worsened by a backlog of Joint Venture (JV) Cash Call arrears.\n\n\u201cThe industry needed reforms to attract more investments and attract the needed revenue to support the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cAs a new administration, we needed to act fast to address the declining prospects of the industry and aggressively drive economic recovery and improve the country,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nAside from the cash call presentation before the joint committee, the NNPC in its data further explained that it would deduct N127 billion during next month\u2019s FAAC, for what it termed under-recovery.\n\nBut the N127 billion February projected petrol subsidy payment (for January) is far less than the N270 billion netted off the company\u2019s revenue in December 2021, accounting for the highest under-recovery paid yet.\n\n\u201cThe November 2021 value shortfall recovery on the importation of PMS (petrol) amounted to N270,831,143,856.56. The recovery consists of the November 2021 value shortfall of N220.110.853.427.56, plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N50,720,290,429.00 for October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N127.035,585.354.25 is to be recovered from January 2022 proceed due for sharing at the February 2022 FAAC meeting,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the information, the overall NNPC crude lifting of 8.31 million barrels (export & domestic crude) in November 2021 recorded a 7.78 per cent increase relative to the 7.71 barrels lifted in October 2021.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that Nigeria recorded an average production of 1.27 million barrels per day in November/December, while crude oil and gas export revenue received in December 2021 amounted to $5.13 million and $40.14 million respectively.\n\nNigeria LNG feedstock gas receipt was $113.39 million, including receipts of $51.85 million which slipped to December that ought to have been received in November 2021.\n\nFor other receipts, the NNPC data showed that the sum of $62.35 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas fees, as well as interest income was received in December 2021.\n\nIn addition, the sum of N352,518.463,538.25 was the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue for December, while strategic holding cost and pipeline repairs amounted to N3,976,516,985.27 even as product losses amounted to N3,307,613,578.863.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The final statement will come from its National Chairman after a National Working Committee (NWC) or National Executive Council (NEC) meeting.\n\n\u201cI believe the PDP will see the reason why it should not present a northern candidate, knowing also that the Middle Belt Forum and the South strongly advocate the mobilisation of their members to work against any political party that selects a northerner as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe need to address our security and development issues, and the North does not have the moral right to the presidency after eight years of President Buhari,\u201d he explained.\n\nBe Ready for a Requiem, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Tells Main Opposition Party\n\nOn its part, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday described PDP\u2019s plan to throw its presidential ticket open as the most unfortunate decision that if not quickly reversed would lead to the eventual collapse of the opposition party.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia in an interview with THISDAY said it was sad that the party had refused to reciprocate the kind gesture of the people of the South-east over the years.\n\nWhile describing the current agitation for the emergence of the next president from the South-east zone as one based on equity, Ogbonnia said the organisation remained unfazed in its agitation.\n\n\u201cI must tell you that we feel so bad that a party that has enjoyed tremendous support of the Igbos would come out boldly to throw the presidency open not minding our very just and fair agitation.\n\n\u201cFrom 1999 till date, we have continued to support the PDP. In 1999, despite what the party did to our leader, Dr Alex Ekwueme, we still supported Obasanjo. In 2007, we supported Yar\u2019Adua, sustained the support for Jonathan. And today, the best way to pay us back is for the party to throw its ticket open. This is very unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman further noted that the Igbo nation will sustain its agitation until such a time when the whole world will come to the reality that we must have the presidency.\n\n\u201cToday, we have so many of our people who have declared their intention to seek the presidency of the country come 2023, that\u2019s to show you how ready we are,\u201d he said.\n\nOgbonnia however warned that should the PDP refuse to change its decision and reserve the ticket for only candidates from the South-east, it must be ready to face a requiem.\n\n\u201cThis will certainly be the end of PDP. They still have the opportunity of doing the needful. If they fail to do the right thing, it will be the end of the party. From 1999 till date, the other two legs of the tripod have had the presidency, the Hausas, the Yorubas have had their fair share, Even the South-south have had their share and yet the Igbos are treated with levity,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso reacting, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described as ridiculous the move by the main opposition party to jettison zoning and throw open the 2023 presidential race to all interested aspirants.\n\nThe group also said it would watch and see how far the party can go with the arrangement.\n\nPANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, made the position of the group known in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say, it\u2019s a ridiculous decision. We have sufficiently made our position known on this matter. We\u2019ll wait to see how it will go,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Welfare of average Nigerian paramount to ruling party, says Osinbajo\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nBarring any unforeseen circumstance, the National Caretaker Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by the Yobe State Governor, Mallam Mai Mala Buni, will meet this week on the zoning of all the party offices, ahead of the party\u2019s February 26 national convention, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is coming as the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has disclosed that the ruling party would remain committed to the welfare of the common man.\n\nA member of the CECPC told THISDAY at the weekend that the caretaker committee would also set up a zoning committee to address the issue of the zoning of the party\u2019s elective positions.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning committee will consider equity and justice before coming up with its position on zoning.\n\nThe CECPC member, who urged members of the party to ignore all former reports of zoning, also described such reports as fake.\n\nHe said that the expected zoning committee would be guided by justice and fairness by ensuring that all zones and states are fairly represented.\n\nWhen asked whether the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the APC would be summoned to approve the zoning arrangement before implementation, he said the Buni-led committee would play the dual role of the NWC and NEC of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are a child of circumstance. We are playing two roles in one. CECPC is playing the role of both the working committee and the NEC.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any NEC meeting, but we are working with the governors of the party and others to ensure that everything about the convention is set on course and that there will be no trouble. We shall deliver a smooth and transparent convention.\n\n\u201cAfter our meeting this week, every doubting person will keep quiet. At the end of the day, because there is no NEC, the report of the zoning committee will be sent to the President who is the leader of the party and the governors for their perusal and advice and we are set to go for the February 26 date,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, one of the chairmanship aspirants, Mr Saliu Mustapha has insisted that the North-central geopolitical zone should produce the next national chairman of the APC. \u201cIt is for balancing and equity. We are the bridge linking the North and South,\u201d he said.\n\nWelfare of Average Nigerian Paramount to Ruling Party, Says Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Osinbajo has disclosed that the ruling APC would remain committed to the welfare of the common man.\n\nHe attributed this to the party being that of the people and the resolve of the APC to continually ensure that the common man benefits maximally from the government.\n\nOsinbajo, according to a statement issued yesterday by his Media Assistant, Mr Laolu Akande, made this disclosure when he played host to a delegation of the APC Professionals Forum at the State House, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThis is a party of the common man, a party of the people, a party that takes as its cradle, the importance of ensuring that the common man benefits maximally from the government which is why we have the big programmes like the Social Investment Programmes, the largest of its kind in the continent and several of such other programmes that emphasise how serious we take the lot of the common man\u201d.\n\nReminiscing on the party\u2019s formation about nine years ago, the VP noted that APC has made an impact and it is determined to improve the well-being of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the party is also where many young people are, stressing that \u201cwe are the ruling party in Africa\u2019s largest democracy, which by itself is a phenomenal achievement for such a young party.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll find that in the particular ideological direction of our party, it\u2019s one that was clear to the founders of the party, the initial persons and groups that came together to form the party and they came from different parties, but it was to present a left of centre, a social democratic alternative to the ruling party.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo further stated that the APC is determined to ensure the country\u2019s further growth and development, noting that the party carries with it, the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe party is not a mere platform for running for political office, it carries with it the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians and we must make it a place where they are comfortable, a place where they feel this belongs to us. We can even put our resources into it; it is not just for politicians; it is for us all.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said leaders and politicians are there to serve the people and give them reasons to believe in a better country.\n\n\u201cOur people, the Nigerian people, need hope; they need to be able to believe in the politicians; they need to be able to believe in their leaders and if the leaders are within the political party, that political party must have an ideology that is attractive to them, that makes them feel wanted, that makes them feel cared for and I think that role is so crucial.\n\n\u201cIt is the role this Professional Forum must take on to itself. And what it entails aside from that logical objective of the forum; what it entails is defining in writing in various ways what our party stands for.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the significance of the APC Professionals Forum in the scheme of things, the vice president urged the Forum to play more important roles in shaping the party\u2019s ideology.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are many people that say well, we have not done this, we have not done that. There are so many ways of looking at it, but the truth of the matter is that the party was committed and is seen across the country as a party of the common man, which is why I think the role of the Professionals Forum is particularly important because we are trying to shape the ideology of the party\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that professionals are integral to ensuring the party stays focused on the wellbeing of Nigerians and its ideals, as stated in the Constitution and manifesto, respectively.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the professionals cannot do that, then our party becomes all comers, anything goes so long as we have a platform to run for political office. But I think that we, especially professionals, have a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cWe have many who have run their businesses, who have professional organisations or who have excelled in their professions and we know that the only way to do things properly is if we can press on without relenting.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo further hoped that the APC Professionals Forum will also carry the hopes and expectations of millions of the party\u2019s supporters nationwide.\n\nHe also believed that the Forum, made up of professional elites, will be of great benefit to the party and Nigeria because of its leadership and quality of professionals on its board of trustees and as members, who he noted \u201care not just politicians, but people who have distinguished themselves\u201d in their respective fields.\n\n\u201cI think our party will rely a great deal on this forum and I hope and pray that the Forum will realise all of its objectives, including the extra ones that our party must place upon you, especially at this time in the life and history of our dear country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Say over 20 churches burnt, several houses, businesses destroyed\n\nInsist 110 abducted Chibok schoolgirls still unaccounted for since 2014, after 57 escaped from captivity\n\nBy Michael Olugbode\n\nThe people of Chibok local government area of Borno State have decried the neglect of their area by the government, which has left them vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks.\n\nChibok got famous when on April 14, 2014 Boko Haram invaded a school in the community, abducting over 270 schoolgirls.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja on Saturday, Kibaku Area Development Association (KADA), an association of people from Chibok local government area of Borno State, lamented that since the break out of insurgency attacks over a decade ago, their area had been attacked over 72 times, with over 407 persons killed.\n\nThe group also lamented that over 332 persons had been abducted in the council, over 20 churches burnt, unquantifiable houses and businesses burnt, vehicles stolen and grains barns burnt or destroyed by the terrorist group.\n\nThe group, which was led to the press conference by the National President of KADA, Dauda Iliya said: \u201cWe are on behalf of the entire Chibok Community, using this medium to once again call on President Muhammadu Buhari to rescue Chibok Community, an ethnic nationality, from total annihilation by the Boko Haram Terrorists. This is because since the mass abduction of our 276 daughters in April, 2014, wherein 57 escaped (on their own) we still have 110 of them still unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cThe parents and the Community have continued to be subjected to persistent and sustained attacks, killings, abductions, maiming, arsons and other myriads of criminality without adequate government protection. Chibok has been for all intents and purposes abandoned to its own devices by all layers of government in Nigeria.\n\nRight from late 2012 up to this time, the statistics of the state of damage and destruction of lives and property inflicted on the Community presents a worrisome and pathetic picture.\u201d\n\nThey alleged that: \u201cFrom late 2018 to date, the frequency of attacks and level of destruction have escalated and are simply alarming. Just this year (2022) alone, Kautikari (second largest town in Chibok area) was attacked on January 14 with five girls abducted, three persons killed, many houses and churches burnt, etc. In sustaining their carnage, Piyemi, another big town in Chibok area, was attacked on January 20 with 19 persons (mostly girls) abducted and one person, the Vigilante leader, beheaded!\u201d\n\nThey added that: \u201cThe town was practically razed down and virtually all the recently harvested agricultural produce completely burnt down and/or looted. Chibok is predominantly an agrarian community and the whole year\u2019s harvests have been lost to these sustained and targeted attacks posing serious food security concerns in the community.\n\n\u201cWe call on all well-meaning Nigerians and Mr. President in particular, to rise up to the occasion and urgently save our people from total annihilation and starvation.\u201d\n\nThey asked government to synergize with security forces in confronting the menace so as to end the sustained carnage on the people of Chibok and facilitate the return of the remaining 110 daughters abducted in 2014 and numerous others subsequently abducted at different times; for the immediate setting up of IDP Camps in Chibok town and provide Chibok with skills acquisition centre so as to avoid imminent hunger/starvation.\n\nThey also requested the federal government to order deployment of more military personnel as well as better arms to Chibok to halt the continuous attacks on the community and plead with Borno State Governor to do more in organizing and helping the people of the area in securing the state in general and Chibok in particular from attacks.\n\nThey condoled the Nigerian Army for the loss of gallant soldiers including the very brave Brigadier General B.

          "text": "* Asserts Nigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday took a deep look at the countless problems bedeviling Nigeria and declared that only people not inspired by personal profit could bring about the desired national transformation in the country.\n\nOsinbajo, who was speaking in Abuja at the 1st Annual General Assembly of Catholics in Politics and Catholic Business Leaders, also highlighted the imperative of servant leadership and transformational leadership at different levels in society as a force for the common good.\n\nHe said: \u201cHistory teaches us that everywhere there has been a national transformation, it has been brought about by public-spirited men and women of goodwill who, inspired by their belief in a higher purpose other than their own profit, have entered the public square to champion the common good.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said transformational leadership, particularly in a multi-ethnic and multi-faceted country like Nigeria, \u201cis needed\u201d across all levels of government and spheres of society, as its primary focus is the pursuit of the common good to ensure fairness, justice, unity and development in a nation.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cbuilding credible institutions of justice, the rule of law and orderly society are crucial expressions of the pursuit of the common good.\u201d\n\nRecalling the words of His Holiness Pope John Paul II during his visit to Nigeria in February 1982 in an address at the State House in Lagos, the VP stated, \u201conly the harnessing of all the forces for the common good, in true respect of the supreme values of the spirit, will make a nation great and a happy dwelling place for its people.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President stated that the common good as an imperative of public policy and governance was articulated by the second chapter of the Nigerian Constitution, adding, \u201cThe challenge of actualising the common good is coterminous with our quest to actualise the Directive Principles and Objectives of State Policy. Achieving both requires transformational leadership across all levels and spheres of our society.\u201d\n\nHighlighting why transformational leadership is critical to national life, the VP noted that it would spur positive changes across all sectors and spheres of society.\n\nHe added that as a model of leadership, transformational leadership operates by serving and uplifting others because it is servant leadership.\n\nThe VP noted: \u201cThe purpose of power is service, not domination; it is to uplift and empower others rather than to control or oppress. This is a model of leadership that is inseparable from our conception of the common good.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership is, therefore, the pursuit of the common good. But the pursuit of the common good itself is not as easy as it sounds. This is especially so where the wounds and enmities of ethnic and religious conflicts are deep.\n\n\u201cThe common type of leadership will seek the path of relevance and popularity within their own ethnic or religious camps by seeking only the good of their own. The servant-leader will serve his people by emphasising the letter and spirit of the gospel that even our worst enemies were still made in the image of God.\n\n\u201cAnd the pursuit of the common good is the pursuit of the good of those who hate us and have hurt us even in the recent past.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership means that we do not mourn and condemn the killing of those who belong to our own tribe or faith alone, or seek justice for ours alone, because all men are equal before God, and that the pain and anguish of a mother\u2019s loss of a child, is not different from one faith or tongue to the other.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways to cultivate the values that promote the common good (that seeks out the good of others) is in the delivery of justice and cementing the foundations of integrity in society, the Vice President noted.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe most progressive expressions of faith are concerned with justice and justice is impossible without taking the institutions that govern public life into account. In this sense, the purpose of governance and public policy is to establish a paradigm of justice that is measured by how well society deals with its most vulnerable members, settle disputes fairly and speedily, meting out punishment to violators of law without bias or fear.\n\n\u201cOur courts of law must be courts of justice. It means that we must pay attention to the quality and caliber of the men and women who are appointed judges. We must be concerned with their remuneration, and welfare. We must be unrelenting on insisting on their integrity.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also described corruption as a \u201ccancer\u201d noting that \u201cthe cancer in governments anywhere is corruption: \u201cWhen public officials, (be they high or low in the executive, legislature or judiciary) are toll gates for the extortion of the populace while seeking government dispensations, the common good, happy and prosperous lives for the people is impossible.\u201d\n\nHe added that the pursuit of the common good must \u201cinvolve a relentless pursuit of integrity and transparency of public officers: \u201cWe must think through the systems that will reduce human discretion in public-facing institutions. So we must, as a collective, condemn and call out corruption and corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also encouraged Nigerians not to despair, despite some of the challenges, but have hope and belief in the promise of a great nation while urging that Nigerians must be willing to pay the price to achieve national greatness by actively pursuing the common good of all, regardless of tribal and religious differences.\n\n\u201cFulfilling the immense promise of our nation requires men and women of goodwill from various communities and faiths to collaborate in advancing the common good. This is all the more important because it is such coalitions that can heal society of the wounds inflicted by the crude identity politics of religion and ethnicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur future will be shaped by how well we make common cause with other citizens of progressive persuasions to transform our communities,\u201d said the Vice President.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of forging collaborative partnerships, \u201cnot only within ourselves but with other forces which are committed to the common good to positively impact society.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo adds: \u201cOur greatest adversary in our task of national renewal is a feeling of hopelessness \u2013 a sense of futility that seems almost overwhelming. However, we cannot afford to even indulge in such despondency and despair. There is hope and there is much work to be done.\n\n\u201cNigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again. Contrary to opinion in some quarters, this house will not fall. It is being built and needs yet many more people to commit to building the sort of nation that we want. The throes and pangs of birth must not be interpreted as the pains of impending death. We are by the grace of God, more than able to overcome our present difficulties and we will overcome them.\u201d\n\nThe summit, otherwise known as the AGORA Conference, had as theme: \u201cThe Advancement of the Common Good towards Justice, Unity, Structure and Development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian musician Buju wanted to reward his fans, so he created an NFT project",
          "text": "Towards the end of 2020, project lead of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d, Iyobosa Rehoboth, a creative director of Global Creative Operations (GCO), started brushing up on his knowledge of crypto. After learning extensively about ethereum and NFTs, he started selling the idea of an NFT project to several Nigerian music artistes.\n\nThe award-winning music director, popularly known as Prodigeezy, had initially created a design for a joint NFT project for the trio of Nigerian music superstars, Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy, but when he realised that getting the three of them to collaborate on something would be difficult, he abandoned the project.\n\nRehoboth presented his design to some other artistes, who rejected it, until he got it to a Nigerian musician, Daniel Benson, popularly known as Buju. \u201cBuju was open-minded. Having made tremendous progress with his career that year, he was keen on making his brand a global one,\u201d Prodigeezy said. Buju was also, at the time, working on a comic book idea, so it was fairly easy to convince him.\n\nBuju released the remix of \u201cItaly\u201d, featuring Blaq Diamond, with a colourful artwork of his head as the song\u2019s cover. He didn\u2019t want to release a full song, so he uploaded \u201cItaly\u201d to multiple streaming platforms. Before he knew it, it was making waves and, unknown to his many fans jamming to the song, the colourful art cover is in fact an unreleased NFT project.\n\nBuju had seen the NFT project as an opportunity to build a community around his fans, reward and connect with them like never before. \u201cI feel like it is something that people are going to enjoy. I\u2019m always working on a lot of recordings. I feel like it is the best way I could reward people that enjoy my music,\u201d Buju said.\n\nThis Sunday, on a Twitter Space, Buju and the team behind the project offered more details about his NFT project \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201c, a collection of 10,001 unique NFTs of his face. Holders of these NFTs would get perks like access to physical and virtual concerts hosted by Buju, merch items, and a part of the revenue the musician makes from specific music projects.\n\nBuju explained that he would drop more songs, mixtapes, and refixes, and that the project would motivate him to drop some of the songs he has been recording for years now. Buju said that he is always dropping snippets and imagines that holders of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d will be able to claim ownership of some of the snippets he drops.\n\nHe said that while he hasn\u2019t decided the arrangement for the sharing revenue with holders, holders will have a fraction of ownership of some of his songs, which will allow them to earn part of his streaming revenue.\n\nThe roadmap for the project, whose Discord channel has close to 4,500 members, is divided into 3 quarters for this year. More plans will be provided in quarter 1of 2023.\n\nfloats, an extended reality company under GCO, which is building the project, will start and intensify an educational campaign to teach people the fundamentals of blockchain, onboard people into crypto, help them set up a wallet, and educate them about the polygon network.\n\nIn this quarter, the \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d project will be minted publicly and pre-sale will start. It is then holders will begin to get some of the perks of the project. This includes access to PlaySpace, an AR filter for Snapchat and Instagram that takes users through Buju\u2019s career and also offers access to special events and interaction with Buju. Some of the other perks are an airdrop and a life membership mic that unlocks more possibilities in the metaverse and in real life.\n\nIn the second quarter, when Buju announces the release of his debut album, another limited collection of NFTs will be released, which will help holders unlock special access to Buju\u2019s concerts, events, and studio sessions. Merch items with virtual and physical utility will also be released, and some of the virtual merch will contain unlockable NFT content.\n\nThe HeadsByBuju project will dedicate 10% of its primary sales to a creator fund, and the entire community of holders will vote to decide what kind of creative project it would be. This creator fund will also be used to purchase some land in metaverses like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels.\n\nTo ensure that holders reap real-world benefits, the project is collaborating with restaurants, clubs, hotels, and health centres to provide discounts for holders.\n\nThe \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d team wants to build the project on the polygon network, instead of the ethereum network\u2014which NFT projects are usually based on\u2014because they want to get as many people as possible onboarded to the blockchain. While developing the project, the team spoke with prospective users and discovered that the biggest problem to getting onboarded into the space was ethereum\u2019s high gas fees\u2014the amount of money you pay to execute any command on the ethereum network. So, to make onboarding easier for their audience, some of whom are interacting with NFTs for the first time, they said they want a popular and efficient marketplace and less expensive protocol, and polygon ticked all the boxes.\n\nThis is perhaps the first time any African musician has tried to use crypto technology to establish a connection with fans and reward them.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlalekan Olude, roHealth CEO\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us it is a synergy having a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, their partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving them healthcare to them or covering them as part of their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that people use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy produce up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spend.\n\nSince its inception 4 months ago, over 7000 lives and 500 businesses actively use roHealth for making their health coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Amirah graduated from the Obafemi Awolowo University, she found it difficult to get a job despite her second class upper grade in economics. Six months into her search, she was getting frustrated. While hanging out with friends, one suggested that she start a tailoring business. As a student, she had made most of her dresses and even made some for her friends.\n\nThey were confident she could build a business out of her skill. But there was a problem. She needed to get a sewing machine but had burnt through her savings during her job search. She could ask her friends for a loan, but like her, they were also broke.\n\nWhile this is a fictional story, it paints a picture of numerous people in emerging markets like Nigeria. For Amirah, she could take out a loan, but only a few financial institutions would offer her one.\n\nAccess to credit is crucial for the growth of an economy. It gives access to consumers who would otherwise have been unable to afford certain products. However, no one gives out loans for fun. Financial institutions need to get these loans back with interest after a certain period and without a good enough guarantee of that, they will desist from granting these loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat has been the case in Nigeria, where commercial banks have shied away from granting loans to most people but instead focused on a few high net worth individuals. In the past few years, fintech startups like Carbon and FairMoney have sprung up looking to solve this problem using proprietary technology.\n\nWhile some focus on lending, others embed it as a part of their service offerings. Still, one similarity is their use of technology to determine the creditworthiness of customers before granting loans.\n\nImproving access to credit for underserved markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all organisations have this capability, and this is where Periculum believes it has found its sweet spot. Like many Nigerians have done in the past few years, Michael Temitope Collins moved to Canada for his university education, where he studied business administration and management at Thompson Rivers University.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at a couple of Canadian banks and started a few businesses himself. While working at these banks, he researched and discovered many underserved customers, even in Canada.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nHis research also showed that one reason for the problem was the inability of financial institutions to assess individuals and their creditworthiness accurately. With this knowledge, he built a solution \u2014 Periculum \u2014 using existing financial and non-financial datasets.\n\nThe startup, launched in 2019, has seen some traction, getting into Techstars Toronto in 2021 and raising a pre-seed round of $620,000 from investors such as Loyal VC, First Fund, and White Hibiscus Capital, which Collins says exceeded their initial goal of $500k. Although the startup has clients across three continents \u2014 Africa, South America, and North America \u2014 it plans to focus on Nigeria in the interim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe plan now is to build out a separate entity in Nigeria and focus strictly on the Nigerian market. The Nigerian market is unique; it\u2019s not a market where you can operate remotely.\u201d\n\nIn pursuing this plan, the startup has hired Damilola Aluede as managing director to head its Nigerian division.\n\nAccess to credit facilities provides businesses and individuals with numerous benefits. Businesses can scale and unlock demand using credit like M-KOPA and Daystar Power do. On the part of the customers, they can access products and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nHowever, getting credit is difficult for both individuals and businesses in Nigeria. According to Business Day, seven in ten bank customers in Nigeria lack access to credit. In the same vein, only 4% of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the country have access to credit. Therefore, providing a way for banks and lending institutions to assess creditworthiness will increase access.\n\nThe startup has also signed up a few customers in Nigeria, including Lendaba, Sycamore, Golden Ox Partners, Vola Africa, Venero, and Fundii. It also has a working arrangement with API fintech, Mono.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing technology to predict the creditworthiness of a customer is great in theory. However, doing this requires data that is notoriously hard to collect in Nigeria. Unsurprisingly, Collins points out that this is their biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cThe ability to get good data sources is a big challenge in Nigeria. A lot of our data partners have specific customers, so their customers are just a small group of customers compared to the whole. So the challenge now is for us to try and find different ways to get data or the ability to assess the creditworthiness of the large majority that are not involved in the economy.\u201d\n\nTo solve this problem, Collins discloses that Periculum will be making use of existing data such as the NIN and BVN for customers who are already involved in the economy. For those who are not, the plan is to draw on data from mobile transactions.\n\nBusiness model and key differentiator\n\nPericulum can make money in two major ways \u2014 a credit analytics and data analytics service to businesses. Consequently, the startup can charge its customers for API calls or a subscription fee.\n\nPericulum is not the only African startup trying to solve this problem. In addition to the lending startups mentioned above, there is also Toju and CARMA. However, Collins believes that their data analytics solution gives them the edge over their competitors.\n\n\u201cA lot of our competitors do one thing, maybe a couple of things, but we do multiple things. We don\u2019t just provide a credit scoring system; we do a lot of data analytics as well. In fact, our core business proposition is data analysis.\u201d\n\nAs the government and private sector work to improve the economy, increasing access to credit facilities for individuals and businesses will be key. However, challenges such as a lack of uniformity in data collection remain, and startups that can work around them could be successful while unlocking pathways to wealth for more Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin was at an all-time high (ATH) of $68,000; it was definitely a great time to be in crypto. At times like that, crypto traders and evangelists seize every opportunity to remind everyone who isn\u2019t into crypto trading what they are missing.\n\nHowever, it is a different story on the crypto streets as Bitcoin is bleeding out. The flagship crypto has lost almost half of what it gained during the ATH of 2021, and the charts remain crimson red.\n\nThe continuous nosedive has wiped out $1 trillion from the total market cap of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor those who are not new to the extreme volatility that comes with trading or hodling crypto, the current decline is just one of those things. For Ruth Iselema, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange, Bitmama, the current dip in crypto prices isn\u2019t so much of a bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselema revealed this at Techpoint Build 2021 while speaking on the topic, Crypto beyond trading. She touched on other use cases of cryptocurrencies besides trading and how they could be very important to finance in Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s more to crypto than trading\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily for speculative purposes, buying low and selling high, but they weren\u2019t originally created for speculation. According to the white paper by Bitcoin\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the essence of Bitcoin is to provide a \u201csystem for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nToday, Bitcoin trading is more or less a career path for some, an edge against inflation and the light at the end of the poverty tunnel. According to Iselema, cryptocurrencies are viewed this way, especially in Africa, because of the high poverty rate.\n\nAround 40% of Africa\u2019s population \u2014 1.3 billion \u2014 lives in extreme poverty, making crypto trading a very attractive venture. Iselema also pointed out that crypto trading is more popular among other use cases because of the complexities of using cryptocurrencies.\n\nBringing crypto into regular finance\n\nFrom lending, insurance, and exchange of value, cryptocurrencies have other use cases beyond trading. All these are classified under decentralised finance (DeFi), financial activities performed on decentralised networks.\n\nWhen it comes to alternative use of cryptocurrencies, DeFi paints a very vivid picture. It allows crypto to perform the same function as traditional financial institutions with fiat currencies, but, of course, without the need for those institutions.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThe goal of DeFi is to create a financial system without third parties. It does this through decentralised peer-to-peer networks. This means anyone without an Internet connection can lend, trade, and borrow without the usual documentation in centralised finance.\n\nThere are several DeFi protocols such as Compound that provide crypto lending and borrowing services. People who have crypto will make it available to those who want to borrow. Collateral can be provided in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other crypto assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart contracts are an essential part of DeFi as they ensure that every party holds up its end of the bargain. As opposed to lending apps that hassle borrowers after they default on payment, smart contracts immediately carry out the action that was agreed upon if the borrower defaults on payment.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also another interesting use case for crypto. From buying valuable art or music to creating one, NFTs have been a life-changer for Africans and many across the globe.\n\nThere\u2019s still a high barrier\n\nWhile these use cases seem simple enough on the surface, there is a high educational barrier to using them. According to blockchain research tool, Dune Analytics, there are 4 million unique DeFi addresses as of January 2022.\n\nIt is important to note that one person can have up to 10 addresses, and the actual users of DeFi protocols could be less than half of the number of existing addresses. This means that not even a fraction of the global population uses DeFi protocols.\n\nWhile Africa might be the home of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions, it\u2019s still behind in alternative crypto usage such as DeFi. In Statista\u2018s ranking of 20 countries with the most DeFi interactions, only one African country \u2014 Togo \u2014 made the list, ranking 20th.\n\nThis can be owed to the fact that many DeFi platforms are complicated and expensive to use. Blockchain expert Oluchi Enebeli believes that the blockchain space is still largely composed of engineers and developers who do not pay much attention to design and simplicity.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve been touted as the path to financial freedom, crypto usage can be very costly, thus creating a financial barrier. Transactions on the Ethereum network, the most popular network for alternative crypto usage, cost a lot. For context, transaction costs could be higher than the value of the transaction.\n\nWhile there are new networks, Solana and Polygon, for instance, springing up and reducing the cost of crypto usage, only time will tell if alternative crypto usage will catch on in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Oil is near $100 but for Nigeria it is still a story of squandering of riches\n\nWith prices trading near a seven-year high as crude makes a roaring start to 2022, the finances of Africa\u2019s most populous nation remain precariously challenged by corruption and bad management.\n\nNigeria\u2019s opaque oil industry is hobbled by inept policies which meant the flight of badly needed investment resulting in the failure to produce more oil to take advantage of soaring oil prices.\n\nThe country\u2019s president also doubles as petroleum minister but a lack of clear understanding of changing global energy dynamics and a damaging fuel subsidy regime has left Nigeria\u2019s oil output below her OPEC quota.\n\n\u201cNigeria is like a man who is dying from dehydration despite being in the midst of a ferocious rainfall,\u201d says economist Festus Ogbobine.\n\nBrent hovered near $92 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate rose 2% for the week as robust demand tightened global markets. As supply remains constrained, a chorus of Wall Street banks and oil executives are forecasting a return to $100 oil.\n\nAdditionally, heightened geopolitical risks driven by fears that Russia may invade Ukraine have also contributed to crude\u2019s climb.\n\n\u201cDemand has been strong, supply has been struggling a little bit to keep up with that and that\u2019s reflected in the market,\u201d said Chevron Corp.\n\nChief Executive Officer Mike Wirth on Bloomberg TV. Wirth added that geopolitical events are impacting the commodity market more now than they did in the past and that $100 oil \u201cis certainly within the realm of what we could see in the next few months.\u201d\n\nOil\u2019s stellar start to the year comes despite a soft patch in global equity markets after the Federal Reserve signaled it\u2019s ready to tackle inflation.\n\nFor now, crude prices have defied the pull of weaker risk sentiment elsewhere, with consumption on the brink of returning to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAttention will shift next week to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies as they meet Feb. 2 to assess the market and decide on supplies for March.\n\nWhile OPEC+ has been steadily easing output curbs, there are concerns members have been unable to deliver the promised volumes in full.\n\n\u201cOPEC+ production has been gradually increasing, but still not enough to keep up with demand,\u201d said Rohan Reddy, a research analyst at Global X Management, a firm that manages $2 billion in energy-related assets.\n\nAdditionally, if Russia invades Ukraine, \u201cthere is certainly some upside for oil, because not only could sanctions factor in, but theoretically, their position in OPEC+ would be threatened too, and they\u2019ve been an important voice in the room there.\u201d\n\nMarkets are also paying close attention to Ukraine on concern that Russia may launch an invasion after massing thousands of troops on the border, potentially disrupting energy supplies.",

          "text": "Yam tuber, maize, beans, and plantain are some of the food items that gulped the most incomes of Nigerians in 2021 as they recorded the highest increase in prices, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nYam tubers rose the most with a 59.9 percent increase on the average last year while white maize, brown maize, mudfish, white beans, and unripe plantain jumped 57.7 percent, 55.5 percent, 40.9 percent, 39 percent and 30.6 percent respectively.\n\nThe rising food prices only put more burden on Nigeria\u2019s poor population already struggling with stagnant income and deteriorating standard of living, according to experts.\n\nAccording to the 2019 survey NBS, the total household expenditure in Nigeria is N40 trillion out of which N22.7 trillion is spent on food alone.\n\nA 2021 report by the Institute of Development Studies has revealed that food consumes about 101 percent of the average wages of Nigerians and the country ranks second globally where citizens spend almost all their income on food.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s middle-class is increasingly disappearing. If you juxtapose the sustained drive in the prices of food and other commodities with stagnant income or most cases disappearance in income, you will see that the standard of living of many Nigerians has deteriorated,\u201d said Ayorinde Akinloye, a research analyst at United Capital Plc.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, 40 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total population, or almost 83 million people, live below the country\u2019s poverty line of N137,430 ($381.75) per year.\n\nRead Also: Christmas meal rises most in 10yrs on surging food prices\n\nThe pandemic also has pushed an additional 11 million Nigerians into poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Bank also revealed that inflation has pushed 8 million more Nigerians into poverty between 2020 and 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation which has been on the decline for eight months saw a sudden spike in December 2021 to 15.63 percent from 15.40 in November 2021 on the back of increased demand during the festive period.\n\n\u201cThe rise in food inflation came on the back of huge demand during the festive season and insecurity in the food-producing areas as 15 states recorded higher food inflation rates in December 2021,\u201d said Ayodeji Ebo, Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nPlateau, Nasarawa and Benue are some of the worst-hit states by the herder-farmer crisis.\n\nFemi Oke, chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigerian (AFAN) Lagos State chapter, explained that the major reason for the increase in the price of food is insecurity.\n\nHe explained that most of the farmers hardly go to the farm anymore because of these herdsmen and bandits\u2019 issues.\n\nIn the first monetary policy committee meeting of the year, the Governor of the CBN, Godwin Emefiele stated the surge in food prices is as a result of logistics problems particularly transport as there is a wide disparity between the low prices at the Farmgate and high prices at the marketplace.\n\nIn December 2021 specifically, white beans, brown beans, yam tuber, palm oil and vegetable oil were also the food items that accounted for the highest increase in food inflation, the same items when the average for the year was taken.\n\nMuda Yusuf, the immediate past director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said although the Government has been doing a lot especially around CBN financing for agriculture, the rise in food prices signals that more has to be done.\n\n\u201cWe need to deal with the entire value chain, the issues of insecurity and transportation are crucial issues which need to be urgently addressed,\u201d Yusuf pointed out.\n\nThe Global Hunger Index report ranks Nigeria 103rd of 116 countries with the hungriest people, indicating that hunger is severe in the country and may become alarming if nothing is done about this urgently.",

The event commemorated a civilian-led peace agreement made between the Islam and Catholic communities in Mindanao 8 years ago.\n\nBack in 2014, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international NGO mediated the conflict in Mindanao by proposing a peace agreement by local representatives. Witnessed by Chairman Man Hee Lee of HWPL, the peace agreement was signed by Hon. Esmael G. Mangudadatu, the then Governor of Maguindanao, and Archbishop-Emeritus Fernando Capalla of the Archdiocese of Davao representing local leadership. Since then, the province of Maguindanao and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) declared January 24 as \u201cHWPL Peace Day\u201d and have commemorated it as annual event to reaffirm international cooperation and local partnership for peacebuilding in Mindanao.\n\nMoreover, peace monuments were built honoring the peace agreement in Mindanao. The 1st and 2nd Peace Monuments were erected in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In 2021, the third peace monument was unveiled in Cotabato City. Being the first in Luzon, a peace monument in Dingras, Ilocos Norte was unveiled last January 24 as part of the 8th Anniversary event of the HWPL Peace Day celebration. Also, another monument located in Siniloan Integrated National High School is set to unveil on February.\n\nThe event, under the theme of \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and on Earth\u201d, aimed to promote interfaith harmony between religions and raise public support to establish international law for peace.\n\nKey figures gave congratulatory messages including Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senator Panfilo Lacson, Senator Cynthia Villar, Senator Ronald \u2018Bato\u2019 Dela Rosa, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, and TV News Anchor Mariz Umali from the Philippines. Keynote speakers from various fields also presented commitment messages declaring their plans on promoting peace in their respective sectors including law, education, youth, women, private business and media.\n\nPrabhu Mahendra Das, Temple President of Sri Sri Radha Madhava Mandir, said that he decided to participate in the World Alliance of Religions\u2019 Peace (WARP) Office organized by HWPL as \u201ca global platform for religious leaders to talk, share, discuss, learn, and grow together harmoniously and peacefully.\u201d For the contribution to peace in the field of religion, he added, \u201cI firmly believe that all religions should enter into a partnership through the form of a Memorandum of Understanding.\u201d\n\nJustice Raoul Victorino (ret), Chairman of Philippine National Prayer Breakfast (PNPB) and Dean of the College of Law of Philippine Christian University (PCU), shared how he was inspired by the \u201crevolutionary movement\u201d that HWPL initiated to endorse global peacebuilding through the draft the \u201cDeclaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW)\u201d by global experts in international law to advocate peace as a global culture and norm. He declared, \u201cI will strive to get the support of the President of the Philippines for the National Solidarity Support of DPCW. At the same time, I will integrate DPCW [education] in the college of law by collaborating with the Philippine Association of Law Schools.\u201d\n\nAlso, representing the Philippines education sector, Commissioner Ronald Adamat of the Commissioner on Higher Education (CHED) shared, \u201cThe CHED Commission en Banc has issued an endorsement to President Duterte, urging him to declare January 24 as \u2018National Peace Day\u2019, that will provide for simultaneous celebration and observance of peace through peace activities, events, and ceremonies by all instrumentalities and agencies of government, including the private sector. This shall also be celebrated and observed in the education sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to bring all people in the world together to create a world of peace and leave it as a lasting legacy for future generations. To make this world a peaceful place without wars, let us become messengers of peace. Let us remind people around the world of that emotion\u2014a longing for peace\u2014and the Peace Day so they can remember all of this forever,\u201d said Chairman Lee during the closing remarks.\n\n[8th Anniversary of the January 24 HWPL Peace Day] \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and Earth\u201d\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PtBogiRkfFo\n\n...",

Tony Iju Nwabunike stated this in Lagos recently during a press briefing to celebrate the four years of his executives on the leadership of the foremost freight forwarding association in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPursuing bigger revenue and failing to strengthen trade results in greater losses to the economy as investments are either threatened, reduced or made non existent.\u201d\n\nHe also said that totality of customs efforts deployed into revenue pursuit reduces the service\u2019s productivity in many ways\u201d, Nwabunike stated.\n\nWhile appealing President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Finance not to sign the proposed $3.1 billion the customs modernisation contract, Nwabunike said that it would tie down the NCS to a 20 year debt repayment programme that is not necessary for the country which is already contending with huge foreign and domistic debts that are gulping over 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nNwabunike said: \u201cWe want to also advise the Federal Government to be careful before signing into the $3.1 billion Customs Modernisation Project which we heard, will run for 20 years.\n\nWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the Finance Minister to avoid assenting to the deal, saying \u201cNigeria is already in serious debts and customs being a strategic non-oil revenue earner for government shouldn\u2019t be tied to another long term debt repayment for two decades.\n\n\u201cOn this, we call on the National Assembly to take a closer look at the details and ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service and all parties involved observe due diligence that won\u2019t entrap the country in another long term debt repayment for 20 years and maybe for lesser value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its recent inauguration of an expanded partnership committee on blue economy chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, saying its a very bold step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor us, this shows more commitment by the Buhari administration to maritime matters. We urge the committee to go beyond conference room talk and paperwork to addressing real challenges militating against full harvesting of our marine environment benefits in a sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nNwabunike also called on Federal Government to ensure that it includes the ANLCA in some of its committees, saying \u201cAs a body of Customs Brokers, practitioners and investors,\u201d they have vast experience in trade matters\u201d.\n\n...",

We can even put our resources into it; it is not just for politicians; it is for us all.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe VP said leaders and politicians are there to serve the people and give them reasons to believe in a better country.\n\n\u201cOur people, the Nigerian people, need hope; they need to be able to believe in the politicians; they need to be able to believe in their leaders and if the leaders are within the political party, that political party must have an ideology that is attractive to them, that makes them feel wanted, that makes them feel cared for and I think that role is so crucial.\n\n\u201cIt is the role this Professional Forum must take on to itself. And what it entails aside from that logical objective of the forum; what it entails is actually defining in writing in various ways what our party stands for.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the significance of the APC Professionals Forum in the scheme of things, the Vice President urged the Forum to play more important roles in shaping the party\u2019s ideology.\n\n\u201cThere are many people that say well, we have not done this, we have not done that. There are so many ways of looking at it, but the truth of the matter is that the party was committed and is seen across the country as a party of the common man, which is why I think the role of the Professionals Forum is particularly important because we are trying to shape the ideology of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe VP stated that professionals are integral to ensuring the party stays focused on the wellbeing of Nigerians and its ideals, as stated in the Constitution and Manifesto respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the professionals cannot do that, then our party becomes all comers, anything goes so long as we have a platform to run for political office. But I think that we, especially professionals, have a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cWe have many who have run their businesses, who have professional organizations or who have excelled in their own professions and we know that the only way to do things properly is if we are able to press on without relenting.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo further hoped that the APC Professionals Forum will also carry the hopes and expectations of millions of the party\u2019s supporters nationwide.\n\nHe also believed that the Forum, made up of professional elites, will be of great benefit to the party and Nigeria because of its leadership and quality of professionals on its board of trustees and as members, who he noted \u201care not just politicians, but people who have distinguished themselves\u201d in their respective fields.\n\n\u201cI think our party will rely a great deal on this forum and I hope and pray that the Forum will realize all of its objectives, including the extra ones that our party must place upon you, especially at this time in the life and history of our dear country,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, former Governor of Bauchi State, Mallam Isa Yuguda, who is the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Forum noted that professionals in the party felt the need to identify with the Vice President being himself a professional. He invited the VP to the Forum\u2019s upcoming event in Abuja next week.\n\nThe Forum\u2019s delegation also included Deputy Chairman, Board of Trustees and former APC National Secretary, Waziri Bulama; Board of Trustees Secretary, Barrister Dapo Akinosun, SAN, and the national coordinator, Akeem Akintayo.",

She was a girlfriend of one Soliu, who is now in police custody.\n\nSoliu allegedly enticed the girl into his apartment, held her down, and requested one of his buddies to slay her with a knife.\n\n\u201cThe arrested suspects were identified as 17-year-old Wariz Oladeinde from Kugba, 19-year-old Abdulgafar Lukman from Kugba and Mustakeem Balogun from Bode Olude, all in Abeokuta. Soliu was the boyfriend of the girl, he ran away, but was later arrested.\n\n\u201cThey killed Rofiat, cut off her head, packed the headless body in a sack and started burning the head in a pot. They told the police in the presence of a mammoth crowd that they wanted to use it for money ritual.\n\n\u201cThe police have taken the body away to a mortuary,\u201d a source told our correspondent on Saturday.\n\nIn a video made available to our correspondent, Mustakeem Balogun, said: \u201cWe wanted to use just her head alone for money ritual. Soliu strangled her and he told me to assist him and we cut off her head.\u201d\n\nConfirming the incident to journalists, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, the suspects led policemen to the building, where the dismembered body was recovered and deposited at the general hospital mortuary for autopsy.\n\nOyeyemi added that, a short cutlass and a knife used in cutting off the deceased head were also recovered from the suspects.",

          "text": "Teenager Dango Ouattara scored the only goal and was sent off as Burkina Faso surprised Tunisia to reach the Africa Cup of Nations semi-finals.\n\nOuattara, 19, ran onto Blati Toure\u2019s through ball, held off two defenders and cut inside before firing in.\n\nBut he was then sent off in the 82nd minute for an elbow on Ali Maaloul.\n\nThe Stallions, who have never won the tournament, will meet the winner of Sunday\u2019s game between Senegal and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nBut they will be without Ouattara, now suspended after his late dismissal. It came after referee Joshua Bondo\u2019s second trip to the monitor for a video assistant referee check in quick succession.\n\nMinutes earlier, Tunisia were denied a penalty as Soumaila Ouattara caught Wahbi Khazri with a high tackle in the box after initially winning the ball.\n\nBurkina Faso, who are ranked 60th in the world, have won all four Afcon quarters they have ever played including three in the past four tournaments. Tunisia, ranked 30th, have lost six of their past seven.\n\nKamou Malo\u2019s side were hanging on at the end but the Eagles of Carthage, who beat Nigeria in the last 16, never really looked like equalising.\n\nKhazri had two of their better chances, with a 30-yard free-kick tipped over the bar by Herve Koffi and a miscued shot from six yards going well wide.\n\nLorient forward Ouattara was the difference between the teams with his run from Toure\u2019s midfield ball before lashing in just before the half-time whistle \u2013 although his late red card could well end his tournament.\n\nThe Burkinabe, who lost the 2013 final, had chances to win by more \u2013 albeit long before the late drama \u2013 with Cyrille Bayala denied by Bechir Ben Said when he had time and space in the box.\n\nThe final whistle, blown 15 seconds before the indicated amount of injury time was over, was met by wild celebrations from the Burkina Faso players.",

          "text": "Italy\u2019s parties Saturday voted overwhelmingly for outgoing President Sergio Mattarella to remain for another term, averting the political chaos that a failure to elect his successor could have sparked in the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\nElecting the 80-year-old ended weeks of hand-wringing over whether prized Prime Minister Mario Draghi should be elevated, with many fearing such a move would have left the government rudderless at a highly sensitive time.\n\nMattarella needed at least 505 votes from an electoral college of 1,009 lawmakers and regional representatives. He won 759, earning another stint as president in spite of himself.\n\nThe former constitutional court judge had repeatedly ruled out serving a second term but gave in Saturday after Italy\u2019s bickering political parties failed to find another viable candidate.\n\n\u201cI had other plans, but if it\u2019s necessary, I\u2019m available,\u201d Mattarella said before the vote, according to party parliamentary representatives.\n\nREAD ALSO: Putin, Macron Agree On Need For \u2018De-Escalation\u2019 In Ukraine\n\nHe was expected to be sworn in on Wednesday or Thursday. Although many expect him to leave before the end of his new seven-year term, he is likely to stay at least past elections scheduled for 2023.\n\nItaly\u2019s presidency is largely ceremonial, but the head of state wields serious power during political crises, from dissolving parliament to picking new prime ministers and denying mandates to fragile coalitions.\n\nDraghi said the result, after eight rounds of voting over six days, was \u201cwonderful news for Italians\u201d.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted his congratulations to \u201cdear Sergio\u201d, while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier hailed a \u201crole model\u201d who \u201cunderstands the importance of Europe\u201d.\n\nPope Francis hailed Mattarella\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d agreement to stay on during a period of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Italy hard.\n\n\u2018Ideal For Financial Markets\u2019\n\nDraghi, a former European Central Bank chief brought in to lead a national unity government almost a year ago, had been touted for months as the most eligible head of state.\n\nBut many feared his departure as prime minister would destabilise debt-laden Italy as it recovers from a lockdown-induced recession.\n\nItaly is banking on almost 200 billion euros ($222 billion) in EU funds to cement the trend, but the money from Brussels is dependent on a tight timetable of reforms.\n\nInternational investors have been watching the election closely, amid fears Draghi\u2019s exit could undermine the whole programme.\n\nGuido Cozzi, professor of macroeconomics at the University of St. Gallen, told AFP an extension of Mattarella\u2019s mandate was \u201cideal for the financial markets\u201d.\n\nDraghi has also managed to keep to a minimum squabbling between Italy\u2019s parties, almost all of which share power in his national unity government.\n\nBut the Repubblica daily pointed out that, with the campaign for the 2023 election already underway, the year ahead \u201crisks being a replay of the shambles we\u2019ve seen over the past few days\u201d.\n\nIt will now fall to Mattarella to keep the peace: \u201ca task more difficult than we can imagine\u201d.\n\n\u2018Big Sacrifice\u2019\n\nMatteo Salvini, head of the far-right League party, was the first to openly propose the popular outgoing president Saturday, after putting forward a candidate Friday that flopped.\n\nBillionaire former premier Silvio Berlusconi, who took a failed shot at the presidency himself, also said his party would ask Mattarella \u201cto make a big sacrifice\u201d, as did the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).\n\nOnly the far-right Brothers of Italy party was against asking him to stay on.\n\nA double mandate is not entirely unprecedented.\n\nIn 2013, president Giorgio Napolitano was re-elected in an attempt to resolve the political stalemate left by an inconclusive general election. He served nearly two more years.\n\nMattarella was little-known to the public when elected president in 2015, known mostly for his brother\u2019s murder by the mafia in 1980, and for taking a stand as a minister against Berlusconi.\n\nBut the Sicilian has inspired respect and affection across the political sphere, seeking to be a unifying figure through five different governments.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "A former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Soludo, has narrated how he received several death threats when he undertook some reforms in the banking sector.\n\nSoludo, who is the governor-elect of Anambra State, said he received 19 written threats, including physical attacks for undertaking the banking revolution.\n\nSoludo served as Governor of CBN from 2004 to 2009.\n\nHe disclosed this on Saturday as a guest speaker at the first graduation day of students of the School of Politics, Policy and Governance (SPPG), founded by a former Minister of Education, Dr. Obiageli Ezekwesili, in Abuja.\n\nSoludo noted that disrupting the existing social order was dangerous, saying beneficiaries of the current order are powerful enough to organise and viciously fight back to protect their privileges.\n\nAccording to him, with the objective to retain power within the context of short electoral cycles, politicians are afraid to undertake the necessary disruptive changes to guarantee long-term safety and prosperity for all.\n\nHe said: \u201cOil is on its way out, but dismantling the decades-old debilitating institutions and politics around it won\u2019t be a tea party. Nigeria is now at a fiscal cliff with a crunching solvency challenge.\n\n\u201cYouth unemployment, insecurity, poverty, inflation, etc threaten the social fabric. Migrating to a post-oil world of the 4th Industrial revolution and sustainable prosperity will require massive disruptive transformations and restoration of a productive social contract.\n\n\u201cSuch disruptions will come at great costs, and could indeed be dangerous. It is not far to imagine what could befall serious disruptors. In Nigeria, we remember what happened to Murtala Muhammed, and the history books are replete with hundreds of examples of the inherent risks.\n\n\u201cAt a personal level, undertaking the banking revolution in Nigeria came with 19 written threats to me and my family, including physical attacks. Disrupting the existing social order is dangerous. Beneficiaries of the current order are powerful enough to organise and viciously fight back to protect their privileges.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, the masses who are the ultimate beneficiaries are not organised enough to act as a bulwark against the special interests. As things stand currently, we are standing between the rock and the hard place. With the objective to retain power within the context of short electoral cycles, politicians are afraid to undertake the necessary disruptive changes to guarantee long-term safety and prosperity for all.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the existing trends are totally unsustainable and the system is living on borrowed times. Everyone is sleepwalking to the hard place and praying that somehow a miracle will happen along the way.\n\n\u201cSo, who is ready to put his head on the line to lead such productive but dangerous disruptions? Are the SPPG graduates ready for the assignment? I assume that you can\u2019t wait to get to work, to apply your knowledge for a new Nigeria. Am I right? You have my prayers! As I pray for your success, let me throw up a few random nuggets to chew on your way.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, politics has become big business, adding that appointment or election into public office is seen largely as an opportunity to \u2018eat\u2019 rather than a call to selfless service.\n\nSoludo lamented that less than one percent elite have a stranglehold on the public purse, sprinkling occasional crumbs to the citizens as \u2018dividends\n\nHe said: \u201cPolitics has become big business. Appointment or election into public office is seen largely as an opportunity to \u2018eat\u2019 rather than a call to selfless service. There is an army of rich (big men) who have never worked or done any productive work in their lives and believe that it is their right to expect something for nothing.\n\n\u201cThe tiny less than one per cent elite have a stranglehold on the public purse, sprinkling occasional crumbs to the citizens as \u2018dividends of democracy. The citizens themselves either out of helplessness or acquiescence join the party, expecting the politicians to dole out pittance out of the public treasury as charity.\n\n\u201cThe citizens actually clap for such phantom \u2018charity.\u2019 Politicians who refuse to do so are deemed as \u2018stingy\u2019 or \u2018wicked,\u2019 and the circus goes on. With a rent system, a culture of freebies emerged, and most people don\u2019t expect to pay for anything, including taxes, electricity, water, petrol, etc.\n\n\u201cA classic feature of the political environment is that corruption has become part of the \u2018culture,\u2019 with little incentive for honesty. Honesty is scorned as wickedness, foolishness, or mere pretense, and those who dare to be different have a steep price to pay.

          "text": "The Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, has denied placing Nigeria above the United States in terms of infrastructural development.\n\nFashola was recently quoted widely in the media as having said that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration had surpassed his American counterpart, Mr. Joe Biden in the expansion of the country\u2019s infrastructural base.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that the present All Progressives Congress (APC) administration of President Buhari has achieved what even the US government is trying to do, in terms of infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAs at December 2021, we had completed 941 kilometres of roads across all states and geopolitical zones,\u201d Fashola had reportedly said.\n\nBut in a statement issued yesterday by his Special Adviser on Communications, Mr. Hakeem Bello, the minister clarified the statement, alleging that it was \u201cmischievously\u201d attributed to him.\n\nThe minister also blamed the \u201cmain opposition\u201d in the country for being behind the development, noting that it was a precursor to what to expect as the 2023 election approaches.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which lost the 2015 presidential poll to the APC, is regarded as the country\u2019s main opposition to the ruling party.\n\nBello stated that the minister gave further explanation while responding to a journalist\u2019s question on the issue during an inspection tour of the ongoing rehabilitation of the Abuja- Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Dual Carriageway Sections I to III.\n\n\u201cThe first point to make is that I didn\u2019t say that Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure was better than America\u2019s infrastructure because certainly anybody who knows what he is doing will know that America is a much richer nation, their infrastructure is well ahead of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat I was talking about at the presentation with the APC Youth Ministerial Conference was about the challenges of infrastructure and that it is universal. Every country commits to infrastructure as a legitimate way to create work, to grow the economy and distribute wealth as we have seen here.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first point I was making, and that in a democracy you always need the parliament to authorise what you spend on infrastructure and so I was making the comparison that Buhari has been able to get his parliament to authorise his spending.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we were even able to gather here (at the Special Ministerial Conversational Conference). But that the American government is struggling to get authorisation from their own parliament to start what we are already doing. I didn\u2019t say our infrastructure is better than theirs,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the minister, the \u201cdeliberate misreporting\u201d of his clear statement of fact and the almost \u201cspontaneous orchestration\u201d of reactions based on the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d on the social media should send a clear warning to right- thinking and well-meaning Nigerians about the type of campaign, which the main opposition wants to run towards the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a campaign of lies and misinformation. The main opposition has a very uncomfortable relationship with the truth; so, they are going to run a campaign of lies and disinformation; so, we must be ready for it,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that the \u201cprogress\u201d the Buhari government has been making was making the opposition uncomfortable, pointing out that it was meant to disprove that work is going on all across the country.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t disprove that infrastructure is being developed; so, they are going to look for every way to distort and misinform the public,\u201d he said .\n\nThe minister vowed that he would remain undaunted by the \u201cunwarranted attacks based on misinformation\u201d, adding that he took time to make the clarification in the course of the inspection tour to intimate Nigerians with the alleged plan by the main opposition party.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

Foreign exchange inflow through autonomous sources was $13.37 billion, compared with $11.79 billion in the preceding period, as a result of improved inflow from invisible purchases and non-oil export receipts,\u201d the CBN report explained.\n\nThe CBN said aggregate foreign exchange inflow into the economy was $7 billion in October, compared with $13.38 billion in September.\n\n\u201cThe difference between the levels in October and the preceding month was mainly accounted for by the debt proceeds of Eurobonds, which boosted receipts in September 2021.\n\n\u201cHowever, foreign exchange outflow through the economy increased by 32.3 per cent to $4.31 billion in October 2021. Outflow through the bank increased by 45.6 per cent, relative to September (mainly third-party MDA transfers and interbank sales).\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, autonomous outflow declined by 7.2 per cent to $0.76 billion, on account of the decrease in invisible imports.

This is because since the mass abduction of our 276 daughters in April 2014, wherein 57 escaped (on their own) we still have 110 of them unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cThe parents and the community have continued to be subjected to persistent and sustained attacks, killings, abductions, maiming, arsons and other myriads of criminality without adequate government protection. Chibok has been from all intents and purposes abandoned to its own devices by all layers of government in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cRight from late 2012 up to this time, the statistics of the state of damage and destruction of lives and property inflicted on the community presents a worrisome and pathetic picture,\u201d he explained\n\nThe Chibok community alleged that: \u201cFrom late 2018 to date, the frequency of attacks and level of destruction have escalated and are simply alarming. Just this year (2022) alone, Kautikari (the second largest town in the Chibok area) was attacked on January 14 with five girls abducted, three persons killed, many houses and churches burnt, etc. In sustaining their carnage, Piyemi, another big town in the Chibok area, was attacked on January 20 with 19 persons (mostly girls) abducted and one person, the vigilante leader, beheaded!\u201d\n\nAccording to the indigenes\u2019 spokesman, the town was practically razed down with virtually all the recently harvested agricultural produce completely burnt down and/or looted.\n\n\u201cChibok is predominantly an agrarian community and the whole year\u2019s harvests have been lost to these sustained and targeted attacks posing serious food security concerns in the community.\n\n\u201cWe call on all well-meaning Nigerians and Mr President in particular, to rise to the occasion and urgently save our people from total annihilation and starvation,\u201d he said.\n\nThey also called on the state government to synergise with security forces in confronting the menace to end the sustained carnage on the people of Chibok and facilitate the return of the remaining 110 of their daughters abducted in 2014 and numerous others subsequently abducted at different times.\n\nThey also called for the immediate setting up of IDP Camps in Chibok town and the provision of Chibok with a skills acquisition centre to avoid imminent hunger/starvation.\n\nThey also requested the federal government to order the deployment of more military personnel to Chibok to halt the continuous attacks on the community.\n\nThe Chibok indigenes also pleaded with the Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum to do more in organising and helping the people of the area in securing the state in general and Chibok in particular from attacks.\n\nThey condoled with the Nigerian Army for the loss of gallant soldiers including the very brave Brigadier General BK Zirkushu who lost their lives in Askira, while protecting the people against the invading terrorists on November 13, 2021.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
