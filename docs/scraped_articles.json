          "text": "Gunmen have abducted the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Federal Otokito.\n\nHe was kidnapped on Thursday night at his residence in Otuokpoti in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state.\n\nA spokesman for the State Police Command, SP Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident in a statement he issued on Friday.\n\nBuswat said, \u201cPreliminary investigation reveals that the kidnappers stormed the residence of Hon. Federal Otokito on 20th January, 2022 at about 2300hours and whisked him away in a waiting speedboat to an unknown destination.\u201d\n\nHe said the command had launched a manhunt for the rescue of the victim and the arrest of the suspects.\n\nBut Saturday PUNCH gathered that Otokito was kidnapped by suspected oil thieves as a result of his opposition to their plan to set up an illegal crude oil refinery around the community.\n\nThe oil thieves are believed to have escaped from Rivers State where there is an ongoing clampdown on operators of illegal crude oil camps by the state government.\n\nThe leader of the camp, according to sources, had approached Otuokpoti community and held a meeting with some persons, including elders and youths, to set up a camp in a forest bordering the community and neighbouring Agbura in the area.\n\nTo seal the understanding reached at the meeting, the camp leader and his gang members provided bags of rice, lives goats and cash gifts.\n\nHowever, Otokito got wind of the meeting and headed to the village and vowed that as a serving commissioner, he would not allow any illegitimate oil refinery to operate in the area.\n\nHe was said to have also confronted the leader of the gang and warned them to steer clear of the forest, threatening to expose them if they attempted to carry out their illegal business.\n\nApparently angered by the commissioner\u2019s decision to abort their plan, the armed oil thieves were said to have stormed Otokito\u2019s house at about 11pm on Thursday and gained entrance through the kitchen.\n\nThey were said to have headed straight to his bedroom and dragged him into a waiting speedboat at gunpoint at the waterside and sped away.\n\nOne of the victim\u2019s daughters, Favour Otokito, who opened up on the incident, said they were all sleeping when the assailants struck.\n\nNarrating what happened, she said, \u201cMy father, mother, brother and sisters were sleeping when our power generating set went off. So, my father asked my mother if she did not put enough petrol in the tank, she responded that she did.\n\n\u201cSo, she went outside with the intention to bring the generator into the house, so we could find out what the fault is by daybreak. It is our village, so she didn\u2019t envisage any danger. When she got outside, some boys came out of hiding and ran towards her, she quickly ran back inside and locked the door.\u201d\n\nShe said the gunmen forced their way inside through the kitchen and took their father away, eventually.\n\nThe chairman of the Otuokpoti Community Development Committee, Anthony Azibaloa, condemned the abduction of the commissioner saying it as unacceptable and provoking.\n\nHe further said, \u201cKidnapping is not common in our community, so we are surprised over what happened to the commissioner. So to us, the incident is totally unacceptable and condemnable.\n\n\u201cFor now, we have not been contacted by the kidnappers for ransom or any form of demand for his release. We are appealing to the state government and relevant security agencies to swing into action and help rescue our son.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Clamour for equity and justice In Nigeria!",
          "text": "By Braeyi Ekiye\n\nA few weeks ago, Elder Statesman, Chief Edwin Clark, Leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) had cause to castigate his political associate and longstanding friend, former president Olusegun Obasanjo over the latter\u2019s views at a public conference in Abuja that the crude oil in the Niger Delta belonged to Nigeria and not to the region and her people.\n\nClark, who took great exception to Obasanjo\u2019s claim, condemned in very strong terms the stand of Obasanjo on this issue. It would be recalled that, so insistent was Obasanjo on his assertion, he continuously interrupted Chief Clark\u2019s representative at the forum, the Ijaw National Congress Secretary- General.\n\nThe INC Secretary-General had barely spoken on the need for equity and justice in the system of revenue allocation and the entrenchment of Resource Control, when the former president interruption came repeatedly with a bang on the table in anger and desperation, and to the consternation of dignitaries on the high table and the audience.\n\nChief Clark described Obasanjo\u2019s outburst not only as a rude shock and unstatesmanly but disappointing. Clark further accused former President Obasanjo for displaying hate attitude against the people of the oil producing areas of Nigeria.\n\nThe event which attracted Clark\u2019s anger was a Summit on Peace and Security, organized by a group, Global Peace Foundation, on Monday 13th December, 2021 in Abuja, the Federal Capital of Nigeria.\n\nChief Clark said the former President\u2019s argument that resources are placed in the soil by God, and that it was free for all to exploit and appropriate, is an invitation to chaos and anarchy in the country.\n\nChief Obasanjo in his characteristic manner has since debunked Clark\u2019s pungent accusations against him, saying that, he stood by what he said at the forum.\n\nChief Obasanjo said, his outburst was in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution on appointments and resource control. The former President denied claims that he hated the people of the Niger Delta origin, adding that he had never shown any anger or distraught with Niger Delta region nor any part of Nigeria.\n\nIn the concluding portions of his reaction to Clark, the former Nigerian President advised that it would be better for Niger Deltans to think, adjust and negotiate to achieve better results than dictation in matters of greater inclusiveness and right to resource control and self-determination.\n\nThe crux of the matter here, however, is General Obasanjo\u2019s insistence that the oil and gas resources in the Niger Delta region belong to Nigeria and not the region and her indigenous people. Any discerning mind and lovers of justice should be appalled by this hollow thinking and assumption of our revered General. The General should be reminded that Nigeria is a federation; even though it is being run as a unitary government with dictatorial tendencies.\n\nFor long, Nigerians have cried out against this Unitary System of Government being practiced in the nation since late General Aguiyi Ironsi\u2019s Decree 34 of 1966. It is crystal clear that Nigeria purports to be a federation but in practice, she is not. There are roughly twenty five countries operating Federal Constitutions in the world. They include some of the largest democracies and advanced economies. Notable among them are: The United States of America, India, Germany, Russia, Canada, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Australia, Mexico, Brazil and Belgium.\n\nFormer president Olusegun Obasanjo should mention one such federation that has hijacked the resources of its federating components, and wilfully appropriated and misappropriated the proceeds from these resources belonging to parts of the federating units in these countries? Where in the world a President would have powers to allocate oil blocks and other juicy facilities to whoever he pleases, throwing overboard international best practices in such sensitive matters?\n\nThere are fourteen prominent obnoxious and unjustly coercive laws, among others, that constitute the legal frame work of the familiar imperial mechanism laws in Nigeria in respect of petroleum ownership. It has been demonstrated assertively that these laws and constitutions governing ownership, control and management of oil and gas resources in Nigeria are copied verbatim from colonial laws. So, it can safely be said, that the colonial oppression, repression, co-ercion, exploitation, injustice selfishness and rights emasculation that were inherent in colonialism, and replicated in the imperial mechanism laws of Nigeria are still embedded in the falsely christened Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nClearly, Barr. Alex Moro, author of \u201cOwnership of Petroleum in Nigeria\u201d was right when he said in his book that: \u201cThese laws and constitutions governing petroleum in Nigeria are lifted from colonialism\u201d. And that, they contain the vices in colonialism such as the offensive adjectives describing these obnoxious laws as earlier stated in this write-up.\n\nIn the same breath, you can see clearly in Section 44 (3) of the Nigerian 1999 Constitution of the carry-over mentality of Laws and Acts of Colonialism, 62 years after Nigeria\u2019s independence.\n\nBarr. Moro in his book stated thus and I quote: \u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing provision of this section, the entire property in and control of all minerals, minerals oil and natural gas in under or upon any land in Nigeria or in under or upon territorial waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone of Nigeria shall vest in the Government of the Federation and shall be managed in such manner as may be prescribed by the National Assembly\u201d.\n\nIt is also not surprising that Author, Alexander Moro further stated in his book that ownership of petroleum in Nigeria vested in the Federal Government is a violation of the principle of Federalism. The writer posited that, as a Federation, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government has no single drop of oil or gas in the Niger Delta region.\n\nAnother offensive Law is in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in Section 2 which violates the ownership rights of petroleum resources of Niger Deltans. It is an archaic and coercive colonial law lifted or copied into the 1999 Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThose who stand upon and act on these unjust and obnoxious laws of the Federation know that they and their lot have continued to strangle the nation, rendering her search for equity and justice impotent since 1966, from when the military took over political power up until now that we are practicing a semblance of democracy.\n\nThat, General Obasanjo superintended over the affairs of this nation as Military Head of State and later as a two-term civilian President and could not see the EVIL in these laws, designed to conquer a people and deny them of their political and economic rights and privileges speak volumes of the national Leadership quality Nigeria has unfortunately been blessed with, since her independence in 1960.\n\nNo amount of intrigues can daunt the fighting spirit of the Niger Deltans on their legitimately justified demand for resource control and self-determination. The Power Block\u2019s high sounding and clanging cymbals and trumpets of hypocrisy, greed, avarice and thievery at the expense of the owners of these resources in the Niger Delta will in no way sway Niger Deltans from negotiating the just cause of a people who unfortunately found themselves in a hostile political and economic climate and landscape called Nigeria.\n\nOur most respected and revered Elder Statesman and former President\u2019s views on this matter of ownership of petroleum resources clearly represent the unpleasant stance and disposition of Nigeria\u2019s ruling \u2018Power Block\u2019 against the people of the Niger Delta. That, this Group and her allies from within and outside are oblivious of the monumental environmental damages, including the depreciation of health and death of her people, poverty, hunger and stunted infrastructural growth and holistic development, piques the mind.\n\nWhat the people of the Niger Delta are asking for is: Equity, fairness and justice in the Nigerian State. This brings to mind the clamour for a restructured Nigerian State based on True Fiscal Federalism, and the dismantling of the fraudulent 1999 Nigerian Constitution and crafting of a new one to accommodate the aspirations of all Nigerians. A Document that we can truly affirm to. And a Document that would pave the way for a truly United, Peaceful and Progressive Nigerian State. And a Document that would give Nigerians a sense of balance, and above all, a sense of nationalism to spur them to proudly identify themselves as Nigerians.\n\nBraeyi Ekiye is Publisher of Environment Watch and writes from Yenagoa.\n\nPhone: 09031594537; Whatsapp: 09094774864;\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Benue Youth Forum, BYF has lauded Governor Samuel Ortom over his recent comments on amended Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, 2017.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the governor, during an interview with Arise TV on Friday, said the law which was recently amended with stiffer penalties has recorded successes in the battle against insecurity in the state.\n\nAccording to the new law, owners of animals impounded within the state will pay the fines of N50,000, N10,000, N5,000 and N1,000, respectively, per cow, sheep, goat and bird or poultry for violating the law as amended.\n\nReacting to Ortom\u2019s interview, the Benue Youths, in a statement issued and made available to DAILY POST on Saturday by its president, Terrence Kuanum, said the governor was right in all his exposition during the interview.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cThe Governor was right when he said the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of Benue State has been successfully enforced with great achievements recorded. It is true as the Governor stated that the spate of armed Fulani herdsmen attacks has reduced with only a few cases of violations of the law still being witnessed in the border communities.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely correct that President Muhammadu Buhari is not ready to solve security issues in the country, otherwise why would he be insisting on reopening cattle routes when the three regions in the country have banned open grazing? It is a clandestine support from him to the altracious killings by the armed Fulani herdsmen\u201d.\n\nAccording to the group, Ortom spoke the minds of the majority of Nigerians particularly the Benue people when he said that the day President Buhari decides to end the attacks on innocent people by suspected herdsmen, the menace would become a thing of the past.\n\nThe group urged President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto come down from his high ego horse and listen to critical stakeholders like Governor Ortom who have been offering viable solutions for fixing security, economy and other critical issues to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cLastly, we urge the Buhari administration and its agents to focus on their mandate of providing leadership to alleviate the suffering of the people and desist from vilifying and castigating true nationalists and patriots like Governor Samuel Ortom.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s poor handling of the economy has made Nigerians poor and hungry, with a high rate of unemployment and a staggering debt profile. Nothing is working and we citizens of this country cannot wait for the expiration of an insensitive administration of the Buhari led Federal Government before we raise our voices\u201d.",

Maduka Emilio Okoye (born 28 August 1999) was born in D\u00fcsseldorf to a Nigerian father and a German mother.\n\n2. He left Nigeria at six and did not return for 14 years.\n\n3. Born of Enugu-Nigeria father and a German mother, he spent brief times in Enugu, Abuja, and Lagos before he was ferried to Germany where he spent his formative years and become a professional footballer\n\n4. He was groomed at Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s academy before joining Fortuna Dusseldorf in 2017 where he has been manning the post for the reserves.\n\n5. In July 2020, Okoye signed for Eredivise side Sparta Rotterdam.\n\n6. On 30 November 2017, former coach Gernot Rohr talked about his plans to invite Maduka to the National Team before the 2018 World Cup but the plans weren\u2019t successful\n\n7.

On 9 May 2019, Maduka was again invited to the Nigerian U23 Team for the 2019 African U-23 Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan U-23.\n\n10. On 26 July 2019, the coach of the Nigerian National Team, Gernot Rohr, hinted that he is shifting his focus to Maduka as he looks to solve the goalkeeping crisis that has rocked his team since Carl Ikeme quit due to illness.\n\n11.

          "text": "Nigeria will square up against Tunisia in the Round of 16 of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThe Carthage Eagles booked their place in the knockout phase of the competition as one of the four third-placed countries after a shock 1-0 loss to the Gambia on Thursday night.\n\nPrior to their last Group F showdown against the Scorpions, the North Africans needed a win to finish as runners-up.\n\nIn the closing stages of the first half, they were awarded a penalty as Pa Modou was penalised for a foul on Seifeddine Jaziri.\n\nJaziri stepped up to take the ensuing kick and goalkeeper Baboucarr Gaye guessed the right way to save it. This was the third spot-kick which Tunisia have missed at this year\u2019s tournament.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDespite the 2004 African kings dominating the ball possession, it was Tom Saintfiet\u2019s men who had the last laugh when Seraing midfielder Ablie Jallow curled in a superb left-footed strike from inside the box which left Bechir Ben Said standing motionless.\n\nTo reach the last eight of Cameroon 2021, Augustine Eguavoen\u2019s men must negotiate their way past Mondher Kebaier\u2019s team.\n\nThe match will be played Sunday at the Roumde Adjia Stadium in Garoua. The winner from there, will face either Burkina Faso or Gabon in the quarter-finals.\n\nBoth teams have met on four occasions in the history of the competition, albeit, it is Nigeria who hold the upper hand.\n\nThe West Africans squared up against the North Africans for the first time in the third-place game of Ghana 1978.\n\nWith the score tied at 1-1 at the Accra Sports Stadium, the Tunisians walked off the pitch in the 42nd minute to protest the officiating.\n\nThe Confederation of African Football awarded the Eagles a 2-0 win while banning the Carthage Eagles from the 1980 edition. Twenty-six years later, they met at Stade 7 November, Tunis as hosts Tunisia defeated the three-time African champions 5-3 on penalties after the score ended 1-1 after 120 minutes.\n\nTwo years later in the competition, Nigeria avenged their loss by silencing the Tunisians in the quarter-final at the Port Said Stadium.\n\nTheir last outing was in Egypt 2019 when Odion Ighalo\u2019s first-half strike settled the third-place showdown between Gernot Rohr\u2019s men and the North Africans in the fight for the bronze medal.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champions Algeria exited the Africa Cup of Nations after a lacklustre 3-1 defeat at the hands of Cote d\u2019Ivoire. With a single point from three matches, the North Africans finished bottom of Group E.\n\nEarlier, Ghana became the first major casualty of the continental finals and the reigning champions and sky-high favourites Algeria were next on Thursday. Franck Kessi\u00e9 and Ibrahim Sangare scored for the Ivorians before the break and Nicolas Pepe added a third before Sofiane Bendebka got some consolation in the 73rd minute.\n\nThe Algerians were lethargic and without much fighting spirit for much of the 90 minutes and the defeat marked an ignominious exit for the Algerians, who had come into the tournament on an unbeaten run of 34 matches but failed to beat Sierra Leone in their opening match before slumping to a humiliating 1-0 defeat against Equatorial Guinea.\n\nIn 1992, Algeria also crashed out of the competition in the first round as defending champions. In the last five editions, the holders have now exited the competition three times in the group stage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make a rational analysis at the moment,\u201d said Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi. \u201cWe wanted to make up lost ground in this match, we weren\u2019t able to do that. When we didn\u2019t convert our chances early on, perhaps doubt set in. Even penalties we struggled to score.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEveryone\u2019s preparation was chaotic. Three days before we were to receive our players, we are told that they\u2019d come one week later. We cancel our game against the Gambia. Lots of players that struggled with Covid, who can only half-train and have to stay in their rooms.\u201d\n\nHis team had come into the tournament with high hopes, even seeking to emulate Italy\u2019s world-record run of 37 matches unbeaten, but Algeria failed to ignite and their campaign came crashing down in spectacular fashion in the space of nine days.\n\nTheir departure means Africa will crown a new champion on February 6.\n\nThe playing field is more open than ever. The tournament\u2019s two debutants, Gambia and Comoros, were both confirmed in the last 16. Tom Saintfiet\u2019s Gambian team defeated Tunisia 1-0 to finish second behind Mali on seven points in Group F. Comoros, who knocked Ghana out of the competition, progressed after Sierra Leone\u2019s defeat by Equatorial Guinea and the Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s victory.\n\nThey will meet the hosts Cameroon in the second round. In the other blockbusters of the last 16, Egypt take on Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Nigeria play Tunisia.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure and Laide Raheem, Abeokuta\n\nAn unease calm is currently sweeping across parts of the South West over fresh cases of attacks by suspected herdsmen in the area. Eight villages in the Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of Ogun State recently fell victims. There was also the violent exchange between herdsmen and some Ohori farmers at Idofa village, which left five persons dead, and property worth millions of naira destroyed.\n\nIn Ondo State, some herdsmen attacked farmers in some communities located in two local government areas of the state and Akoko division leading to death of five people. The attack prompted some women in Auga-Akoko and some other neighbouring towns and villages to protest half-naked against the killings and rape and other dangerous attacks being perpetrated by herdsmen against the indigenes. They then appealed to operatives of Amotekun corps and local hunters to come to their aid, as they can no longer sleep with their eyes closed or go to farm.\n\nIn recent times, there had been reported cases of kidnapping in the Ogun State axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The three flashpoints on the road are: Ogunmakin, Onigaari and Ishara. Some cases of kidnapping resulted in payment of ransom running into millions of naira while some led to the death of the victims.\n\nThree victims were kidnapped on the highway on Sunday, January, 16, by gunmen. The Amotekun Commander in Ogun State, Mr. Dave Akinremi, a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police, told Saturday Sun that the agency\u2019s security outfits in Ogun and Oyo States have been collaborating to improve the security on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway in conjunction with other security agencies.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe revealed: \u201cWe have meetings of Council of Amotekun Commanders, where we fashion out strategies that we have been employing in checkmating criminal activities. We have been having joint patrols and operations when the need arises. We do share intelligence.\u201d On the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway incident, he acknowledged two cases of kidnapping in recent times but added that they are working out a new approach to security joint operations around the axis.\n\nBut the Secretary-General of Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Dr. Kunle Olajide, while describing as \u201cdisturbing, embarrassing and frustrating\u201d the resurgence of kidnapping on the expressway, called on the governors of Lagos, Ogun and Oyo States to \u201csit together and get the security agencies to monitor the road, supervise it, and be on patrol 24 hours of the day on the highway.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the commissioners of police in both Oyo and Ogun States have visited the flashpoints to beef up security on the entire stretch of the ever-busy road. They assured road users not to entertain any fear whenever they are traveling through the axis. When contacted, the Amotekun Commander in Oyo State, Col Olayinka Olayanju (retd), said that the Nigeria Police Force is the lead security agency in internal security and has been coordinating other security agencies to ensure security of lives and property on the rod.\n\nOgun State government says it will not allow any part of the state to be taken over by terrorists, killer herdsmen, kidnappers or bandits as a safe haven to unleash mayhem on the people. It added that it is already collaborating with neighbouring states like Oyo and Lagos to comb its forests so as to smoke out the \u201charbingers of destruction.\u201d Akinremi who stated this while speaking to newsmen yesterday in Abeokuta, noted that Amotekun personnel in Ogun and Oyo states are now combing the forests to dislodge the terrorists while disclosing that the state government has concluded arrangements to fortify all the 20 local government areas of the state with Amotekun operatives.",

          "title": "2023: We\u2019re talking with stakeholders to zone presidency to",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nSenate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has said he and others are discussing with stakeholders in the All Progressives Congress (APC), from other zones to zone the party\u2019s presidential ticket to South East.\n\nSpeaking on Silverbird TV on Friday, the former Abia State governor said a president of Igbo extraction will change the fortunes of Nigeria.\n\nKalu said only the North East and South East have not produced a President and that he is having conversations with other zones in the country to see this fact and explain to them why the South East should be supported. He said at the end of the day, he would abide with whatever the party decides.\n\n\u201cI have been consistent in saying that there are only two zones that have never been president in Nigeria and it is the North East and the South East and if we are to sit, I would say that you should zone it to my village because that is what I would like to see. But what is the feeling of the other generality of Nigerians? The party is supreme and I believe in whatever the party says. When we get to our caucuses, we can discuss there, but if you want my personal opinion, it should be zoned to my village so that I can become the president and give Nigerians what they would like to see.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to other zones in the country to see that the South East has never produced a president and this conversation is going on very well. We need other stakeholders from across the country to agree that the presidency should be zoned to the South East and at the end of the day, it is left for the party and the Nigerian people to decide.\u201d\n\nOn what the country will benefit from a president from South East, Kalu said: \u201cA president of Igbo extraction means that Nigeria is ready for a miracle. I am not going to play politics, we will centre our policies on the growth of the economy. If we have a President from the South East, you can be assured that everyone will win. I am ready for the job but I can tell you that when I met with Bola Tinubu, Governor Dave Umahi and Pius Anyim, I told them that I was not running. But a couple of days after my discussion with them, I had conversations with elders from the North, West and Niger Delta from January 5 and on January 8, I came back to Igbere and met members of my community and they said it is a possibility. It is for that reason that I went back to those I told that I would not run but I would still have a meeting with them to tell them formally that I would run for election. I have always said that there is nothing like Igbo presidency, what we have is a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction because Igbo is not a nation and when you are not a nation, you can\u2019t produce a president.\n\n\u201cTinubu is not a threat to my ambition and I am not a threat to his ambition. We are very close friends and politics cannot separate us. When I newly became the governor of Abia, my children were attending school in Lagos and they were living with Mrs Remi Tinubu. In 2003, when as governor, he was lagging behind, I came to Lagos and took him round to meet with Igbo and made sure he won re-election and that is what caused my problem with former President Olusegun Obasanjo. He has his idea on how he does things and I have my idea on how I do things and if we meet at the Eagles Square, I would give a good account of myself,\u201d Kalu said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe warned those who claim that the South East does not speak with one voice when it comes to politics to stop blackmailing the zone, insisting that in a democracy, everyone is allowed to have an ambition and express an opinion.\n\n\u201cWhich zone in the country have ever spoken with one voice? This is blackmail that people use against the Igbo by saying we don\u2019t speak with one voice. When Buhari ran for election, did Atiku Abubakar not contest? Is Atiku from my village? He\u2019s a Fulani man like Buhari and they contested against each other. When Obasanjo ran for election, Olu Falae ran against him. Democracy is not a one-man show. People should stop blackmailing Igbo by saying we are not together. The beauty of democracy is the more the merrier, which is why after telling some people that I would not run, other people persuaded me because they know that I can get the job done.\n\n\u201cGoing to tell the president that you want to contest for election makes it look unserious. When it gets zoned, you can then formally go and tell the president that you want to contest. The President cannot win elections for anyone; he cannot put anyone there. He is going to allow Nigerians to choose who they want to lead them. I have a way of doing things and Tinubu has his own way. His style is to go and inform the president that he wants to contest but that is not my style,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Abia APC, Kalu maintained that he is the leader of the party in the state and does not belong to any faction and that he told the national chairman that if the list of local government and state executives are given to him, he will work with them if the majority of the people are satisfied with the list.\n\n\u201cIn a large party like APC, there must be issues. But on February 26, we would surprise Nigerians and show that we are united. In Abia State, I am the leader of the APC and my relationship with the party is very cordial. I don\u2019t belong to any faction and I have told the national chairman that any day he gives me the list of local government and state executives he wants me to work with, I will work with them if the majority of the people are satisfied with the list. We have a father figure in Buhari and we have people who can calm things down, so all the issues would be resolved before the convention.\n\n\u201cI have no plans to join the PDP if I fail to pick the ticket. If I don\u2019t have my way, I will go back and sit in the Senate where I would be useful to the people of my constituency. I am not desperate to be President but now that I still look very young, I am anxious to contribute my quota to the development of Nigeria. I would be a President that would address the issue of insecurity and the economy. When I was governor of Abia, there were security and I tackled it effectively and I can repeat the feat. Wherever President Buhari stops on fighting corruption, I will take it over from there and I will be very ruthless because corruption is the root of every evil. I fought corruption in Abia and I can do it again,\u201d Kalu said.",

          "title": "Why National Assembly must pass Gender and Equal Opportunity Bill -Bisi Fayemi",
          "text": "Wife of Ekiti State governor and chairperson of Nigerians Governor Forum Wives, Bisi Fayemi, recently spoke at the just concluded first-ever National Progressive Women\u2019s Conference. At the panel discussion with the theme: \u201cGiving Voice to Women\u2019s Visibility: Our Support\u201d, she spoke on why female politicians must not abandon those who worked hard to put them in office, and why the women must up their demands ahead of the 2023 elections and hold party leaders accountable. JULIANA TAIWO-OBALONYE was there.\n\nWhat does the term women visibility mean to you?\n\nWomen visibility, for me means three things. And I am saying this based on my own experience of engaging with women in my own state in Ekiti. First of all, it means I need to be an advocate. My background is in international development, specifically gender and women civil rights.\n\nSo when my husband became the governor of the state, my first port of call was to look at our legal and policy framework in the state. Without going into too much detail, I\u2019m pleased to let you know that my advocacy has brought about five laws in the state for the promotion and protection of the rights of women and girls. The laws are: Ekiti GBV Law (2011 revised in 2019 to domesticate VAPP), I Chair the Ekiti State GBV Committee as well as the Ekiti State HIV AIDS Control Agency, Ekiti GEOB (2013), HIV Anti-Stigma Law (2014), Treatment, Care and Protection Law for Sexually Abused Minors (2020) and Ekiti Mental Health Law (2021).\n\nAnd again, through my advocacy, I have managed to secure positions for women in leadership, and not just appointing women into positions because the governor feels like doing so but to ensure that it is enshrined in our laws and policies. So for example, we have a Gender and Equality Opportunities law in Ekiti State and 35 per cent affirmative action is a part of that legislation in the state. I\u2019m not saying that we have achieved the 35 per cent, but at least we used it to negotiate and to threaten, if I might use that word, our party leaders.\n\nSecond, I see my role as the need to empower our women. I need to able to provide support for those, for example, who might not be able to benefit from political appointments, who might not have the qualifications, because it always comes up. When women are mobilising for election, and singing and dancing and organizing Aso ebi, they are qualified then. But when it comes to giving out positions or appointments, that is when their qualifications are called to question. And so for those who can\u2019t benefit from appointments, I try and ensure that they are empowered in other ways, with empowerment materials, education opportunities, training, and so on.\n\nAnd the third thing that comes to my mind is being present, be there for our women. There is a proven accusation of women in leadership, whether we are talking about women who are parliamentarian or women who are ministers or First Ladies, that once we get into these positions, we are no longer there for the women. They invite us to their weddings, birthdays, funeral ceremonies, we are too busy to attend or we send a representative. If we can show up to ask for their votes and support we can be there for them when they need us when we get into office. You don\u2019t know what it means to a woman from a local community for a First Lady to show up at her event and for her to let people know that yes, I am the one who brought the First Lady or even the governor to my programme. So in summary, I believe, being an advocate, and empowering our women and always being there for them is very critical to those of us who occupy these positions, because as I said earlier, we are in this position, because these women worked hard to make it possible. And so we owe them.\n\nBut speaking as a Nigerian woman now, not just as a First Lady, I think we need to up our demand, and next year 2023, presents us with an opportunity. We need to hold our leaders accountable. All of us here in this hall, for example, we worked hard to mobilise for members of the National Assembly to occupy their position. So we need to go and ask, particularly the men, why are they still holding back on passing the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill? Why? On what basis are they going to come around next year to ask for our votes? So we need to ask them questions. And for those that are aspiring into the presidency, what are they going to do for Nigerian women that is completely beyond rhetoric? We have the National Gender Policy, for example, how many states in Nigeria have domesticated the national agenda? I could go on but we need to up our demands. It cannot continue to be business as usual.\n\nHow can women be encouraged to increase their participation in politics?\n\nMy response is that we need to mobilise intentionally. And for me, mobilization towards an election starts from the day the previous election ends. It doesn\u2019t start couple of months before the election, when INEC releases the timetable as they have just released the timetable now. And so I would like to believe that all of us here have been actively engaged in mobilising women in our state through structures.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nI, for example, I have had structures to mobilise Ekiti women in politics since 2006, when my husband first decided to run for office. And it is not as if Ekiti women were not organising before, they were but their efforts were not being recognised. And even when some of them were allowed to participate, there was always a reason why some could be pushed out. So I created a broad network of what we call women stakeholders, across all the 16 local governments in Ekiti State. And that structure still exists up to today. And we\u2019ve continued to build on it and to strengthen it. And so we are always prepared for every electoral cycle. It is from these stakeholders that we have women who are capable of running for office. In these stakeholders, we have young women we push forward for leadership. And amongst these stakeholders, we have women who know what party loyalty means, and who are not just fair weather politicians and even the men say that female politicians are more loyal than men. So using our structures to mobilize is extremely important.\n\nLike I said, I have advocated for the inclusion of women in politics and governance. I supported four women into the Ekiti State House of Assembly in 2011 and I did it again in 2019 with four women in the State House of Assembly and one in the House of Representatives. I have also recently got a significant number of women into local government leadership as chairs, vice chairs and councillors. In order to strengthen spaces for women\u2019s leadership development, I established the Forum for Women in Development in 2012 and Forum for Spouses of Ekiti State Officials in 2011.\n\nSecond, again, speaking as First Lady, I think it\u2019s important that we have a two-way process of engagement. It goes without saying that we need to continue to engage with our grassroots female politicians. But we would also like our women to engage us as well, regardless of whether you are at the grassroots or whether you are at the National Assembly. There are a lot of women with all due respect, because we can\u2019t come to a place like this and leave if we cannot tell one another the truth, then it means we have deceived one another.\n\nThere are lots of states where the female politicians don\u2019t have a really great relationship with the state first lady. And I think that needs to change. In most cases, the relationship might be a great one. But ideally, it needs to be better.\n\nAnd again as First Ladies, you can\u2019t just demand respect, you have to earn it. And the fact that I have hand-held women and nurtured them to get party tickets, sponsor them, begged on their behalf, threatened on their behalf and done everything to ensure that they occupy office right from local government level up to the House of Representatives, I believe, I have earned that. So I believe all of us here, as First Ladies, should make that commitment.\n\nWhat concrete changes are you making, or hoping to make to improve women\u2019s visibility as a first lady of your state?\n\nAgain, I would like to go back to the issue of the policy and legal frameworks, because this problem we are trying to address is a problem that has to be tackled, with a pressure cooker approach. Pressure from below, and pressure from the top. Pressure from below comes with awareness raising that my sister Osun spoke of, and conscientiousness raising of our women from grassroots level. But there also has to be pressure from the top. And that\u2019s where the laws and policies come in. We do need these laws and policies to ensure that we do not continue to beg. Because we have the Gender and Equal Opportunity Bill (GOB) law in Ekiti State, every time there\u2019s an election, especially local government, I pick up my calculator, and I sit with the party chairman. I\u2019m not joking. I mean this. I sit with the party chairman with a calculator and the Chief of Staff, and I asked them how many seats are available and how many are you giving us? And that is how come in the last local government elections that we had a few weeks ago, in Ekiti State, we now have three women as chairs of local government, we have never had any before, 14 women as vice chairs, and 44 as councillors. It could still be better, but at least I was able to invoke our Gender and Equal Opportunity Bill (GOB) to say, if you can\u2019t give us 35 per cent, what are you able to give us? You cannot give us nothing. And there are states in Nigeria where we have no women at all in the state of assembly or the local government. So those things need to change.\n\nWhat would be your final word to the women ahead of the elections?\n\nWe are determined at the Nigeria Governors Wives Forum to use our position to advance the cause of women. Our husbands got to where they are today because of the hard work of women put together for their political journey. So, women you have done more than we can ever repay. So if you ask us to do things to support you, we are not doing you a favour; we are doing what needs to be done. Be reassured that we are working with our husbands that women get what is rightly theirs. From this conference we should have a resolution that the APC constitution should be amended to reflect the need to have 35 per cent of women in positions, whether it is elective or appointment. Our women are very good at talking, mobilising and dancing and we have no apology to make on that. But we can govern, we can rule, we can lead and now the time has come for us to show the men that we will continue to support but they should not take our support for granted.",

          "text": "* Akume: Chairmanship already assigned to North-central, commends Caretaker Committee\n\n*Sheriff: Rumoured zoning aimed at stopping me from leading APC\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAhead of its National Convention in February 26, there is confusion in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the zoning of its chairmanship, with some of the aspirants insisting that it had be decided, and that the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) should just announce it. Others are saying no decision had been reached and want zoning jettisoned.\n\nOn the flip side, except the unforeseen happens, the Chairman of the CECPC, who is also governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, is scheming to be on the chairmanship ballot paper when the party converges on Abuja February 26, to elect new National Working Committee (NWC) members.\n\nThe Buni-led CECPC had consistently resisted pressure to hold the elective National Convention, with a plan to sit tight and conduct the party\u2019s primaries for the 2023 elections, but recent push from President Muhammadu Buhari forced it to bend backwards, resulting in the announced convention date.\n\nAspirants from outside the North-central, where the National Chairman\u2019s position is rumoured to have been zoned, are anxious for a quick official position from CECPC on the issue, to know whether to halt the time and resources being expended on their campaigns or not.\n\nAlso, by yesterday, some chairmanship aspirants from the North-central were insisting that the party\u2019s stakeholders had all agreed that the position of Chairman be zoned to the region and that the CECPC should just do the needful by making a formal announcement.\n\nOne of the chairmanship aspirants from the zone and the Minister of Special Duties, George Akume, yesterday insisted that the party had zoned the chairmanship to North-central and commended the party\u2019s leadership for doing so.\n\nAkume, who spoke in Abuja through Simone Shango, the Chairman, Contact Committee of his Campaign Organisation, said it was normal for the party to \u201cdeny the zoning arrangement at this point, but a formal announcement would be made soon.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former Governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, who is also a chairmanship aspirant, described the claim that the position had been zoned to North-central as fake news, adding that other aspirants are afraid of going into the convention with him.\n\nSheriff insisted that he was the target of the rumoured zoning of the position to the North-central, saying he remained the candidate to beat.\n\nHe is of the view that anyone can be chairman \u201cbut not everybody has the capacity to be the chairman.\u201d\n\nAnother chairmanship aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha said while it still remained \u201ca rumour\u201d that the APC chairmanship had been zoned to North-central, it was still in line with his expectation.\n\nMustapha who spoke through his media aide, Dapo Okunbanjo said he remained the frontrunner for the number one party position.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for this zoning, we\u2019ve heard this but we still consider it a rumour just like what the CECPC said. And if indeed it\u2019s zoned officially to North-central, it will be in line with our expectations. We still see ourselves as frontrunners in the race whether it\u2019s zoned or not, but what we are doing is to take things one step at a time.\u201d\n\nThe source that leaked Buni\u2019s move to THISDAY last night, added that the need to perfect the Yobe State governor\u2019s game-plan influenced the delay in announcing the zoning for the office of National Chairman and other party positions.\n\nThe source said: \u201cBuni wants to remain National Chairman; forcing him to organise a National Convention was just a temporary setback. The plan is to declare the National chairmanship position open to the entire North, so that he can contest. Buni has 14 APC governors with him in this plot. His main ally, Abubakar Malami, the Minister of Justice had already cleared the way for him by openly declaring a few weeks back that he could legally combine the office of governor with that of the party\u2019s chairmanship.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY learnt further that Buni, Malami and the 14 governors working with him in the plot would soon meet President Buhari, to convince him on the need for the Yobe governor to continue as chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cOnce they get Buhari\u2019s support, the deal is done. All the other chairmanship candidates will have to step down. Even if they don\u2019t step down, Buni\u2019s name will be the only chairmanship candidate one on the official list of contenders to be voted for on D-Day.

          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday warned multilateral finance institutions against defunding oil and gas projects in Africa, as the Western World continues its drive to phase out polluting fuels, saying such a step would have medium and long term consequences on African economies.\n\nOsinbajo, who delivered a special address (virtually) at the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, added that drastic actions would ultimately impede the aim of phasing out fouling oils.\n\nHe declared: \u201cWe need to ramp up energy access in response to this situation, which is why the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies must be just and fair. We are emphatic in our view that natural gas, which Africa has in abundance, must be accepted as a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we in Africa are working towards the globally accepted net-zero future, we are also conscious that our energy needs are increasing with the growth in our economies. We must not allow this worrying situation to be compounded further by global inaction, processes and rules that make it difficult for Africa to adapt to climate change or indeed to develop.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also urged the international community to meet its pledge that was recently re-affirmed at COP-26, of providing $100 billion annually in climate finance to support climate change efforts in developing countries.\n\nHe likewise called for a waiver on the intellectual property rights, to allow African countries produce COVID-19 vaccines to contain the spread of the virus and improve protection for Nigerians and Africans.\n\nThe vice president lamented that less than 10 per cent of African countries had vaccinated 40 per cent of their population.\n\nHe also warned that there would be a relatively slow rollout of vaccinations in Africa due to resource constraints, adding, \u201cYet, vaccinations remain essential because of the mutation of the virus and the emergence of variants that may be more dangerous than the Omicron.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo continued: \u201cThere are also the issues around African countries being able to produce their own vaccines. And that is entirely possible with cooperation, especially around intellectual property issues. We have to look at issues around patent rights, intellectual property rights, and exclusivity rights; especially if we\u2019re going to improve the chances of African countries to manufacture vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at relaxing those rights. Patent waivers and intellectual property waivers will be important. These are proved to be a problem now. No one seems to be making much progress in that respect. But we can\u2019t really talk about African countries producing their own vaccines if we don\u2019t address those important structural problems. I think that could very easily be done.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo stressed that despite giant strides recorded across Africa, \u201cthere are still challenges to overcome which requires international collaboration that can help to tackle climate change, address security concerns, promote economic prosperity, combat disease and improve governance.\u201d\n\nHe listed some of the progress on the African continent, including the recovery from the global pandemic, economic growth by 3.7% last year and a projected 3.8% growth in 2022.\n\nThe vice president noted: \u201cThere is now in place an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to fast-track economic transformation just as the continent is making giant strides in agriculture, manufacturing and digital technology.\u201d\n\nHe added that in Nigeria for instance, 6 unicorns have emerged in the past six years.\n\nOsinbajo said it was time for the international community to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d by meeting its commitments towards advancing growth in developing economies, especially climate change obligations.\n\nOn the issue of peace and security, the vice president stressed that African countries face a serious threat of terrorism arising from the encroachment of global terror groups and their franchises into Africa.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is imperative for the international community to make more robust interventions to clear terrorists from Africa just as it did in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The United Nations Security Council must find unanimity in working with and assisting African countries to eradicate the menace of terrorism in the continent once and for all.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also called on the international community to support African countries to overcome fiscal challenges arising from their limited revenues.\n\nAccording to him, the creation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights last year was a step in the right direction, \u201cbut more needs to be done to enable African and other developing countries access the SDRs that are not needed or being used by developed or emerging economies.\u201d\n\nHe further urged multilateral organisations to consider the huge obligations placed on African countries and adopt debt relief initiatives such as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments in a manner that would not further constrain the resumption of growth to the continent.\n\nOn governance, Osinbajo called on the international community to support the efforts of West African leaders, under the auspices of ECOWAS, particularly their condemnation of the incidences of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats and unconstitutional changes in government in the region.\n\nThe vice president was one of the 12 guests that delivered Special Addresses at this year\u2019s event during which no fewer than 25 Heads of State and Government featured generally at the virtual forum since Monday.\n\nThe 2022 virtual edition of the forum features a mix of visionary \u201cstate of the world\u201d special addresses and ambitious high-level leadership panels focusing on critical collective challenges, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Vows never to let anyone impose himself on Nigerians\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, while inaugurating some projects in different parts of Kaduna State, gave a generous pass mark to the Northwestern state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, saying he was writing history in letters of gold.\n\nBuhari, who confessed to having taken El-Rufai\u2019s loyalty for granted, and went on to profusely thank him, however, vowed never to let anyone raise an army of thugs with a view to forcing himself on Nigerians, as the nation journeys through the next national elections.\n\nThe president was in Kaduna for a two-day working visit, and arrived Wednesday night from Banjul, Gambia, where he attended the inauguration of President Adama Barrow, for a second term of office.\n\nBuhari, who flew in a helicopter, landed at the Murtala Square and commissioned the remodelled Square.\n\nReceived by El-Rufai and top government functionaries, the president commenced his activities in Kafanchan, where he commissioned some road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme, before returning to Kaduna at about 11:45am.\n\nAt the Murtala Square, the new city centre of Kaduna State, the president, while admiring the remodelled edifice, recalled that he was constrained by family challenges to relocate from Daura to Kaduna, after he was released from detention as a former military Head of State.\n\n\u201dI can hardly find my way in Kaduna due to the development taking place here and the governor, has committed himself to change Kaduna for good and has been very successful at that, and Nigerians are appreciative that you are writing your history in letters of gold,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet, another instance, an overly impressed Buhari added: \u201cThank you very much, Your Excellency, and remarkably, you became my governor. I don\u2019t think I have any input. Zainab became my minister of finance.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you are from the gentleman I respect and go to his house (apparently referring to El-Rufai). This is fabulous coincidence and I thank God for it. Therefore, I have taken your loyalty for granted,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nStill in Kafanchan, Buhari underlined his resolve to consolidate the country\u2019s political system to improve the quality of the people\u2019s lives, because \u201cthe people matter.\u201d\n\nAddressing the palace of Alhaji Muhammadu Isa II, the Emir of Jama\u2019a, Buhari said, \u201cWe are doing our efforts to consolidate the system for the good of the people because they matter.\u201d\n\nHe used the opportunity to speak about the use of the police and the military, in dealing with security situations but urged Nigerians to develop confidence in civil authority to build a system \u201cfree of chaos.\u201d\n\nBuhari, therefore, reiterated that, \u201cNobody should be allowed to raise an army of thugs to force himself on the people. This must be very clear.\u201d\n\nThe president further gave assurances of the determination of his administration \u201cto hand over a better Nigeria than the one we inherited,\u201d and urged Nigerians to be fair in their assessment of what his government has achieved especially, on the campaign promises he made ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nThe president, who inaugurated the newly remodelled Murtala Mohammed Square, also unveiled the 136-bed Infectious Disease Hospital, LEA Lokoja Road Primary School, Rigasa, Aliyu Makama road and the Leventis underpass, executed by the State government.\n\nHe praised Governor El-Rufai for completing people-oriented projects in the Kaduna metropolis as well as other senatorial districts in the state.\n\nAlso, while inaugurating the 800-metre long flyover in Kawo, Kaduna, amid tight security, the president recounted how he narrowly escaped a targeted bomb attack in the vicinity in 2014.\n\nReminiscing on the unfortunate incident, which claimed the lives of many innocent Nigerians, Buhari thanked God for sparing his life on that fateful day along Ali Akilu road, Kawo-Kaduna.\n\nHis words: \u201dFor many years, I always plied this route and I cannot recount how many times I crossed it. There was an attempt on my life on this road. Nothing happened to me just like the 30 months I spent during the civil war.\n\n\u201dThey wanted to blow up the vehicle I was in around the secretariat but my escort somehow stopped them. But before we came to this bridge (Kawo), they became more desperate and there was a small market in the area, where the device exploded. But God protected us and here I am again,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter commissioning the newly constructed Dan Haya Road, Katsina Road and the Emir\u2019s Palace Road in Kafanchan, Buhari, Buhari stated again, \u201cI\u2019m very impressed by the rehabilitation of the town (Kafanchan) I have seen.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents of the area to show appreciation for the projects, and commended the Emir, for his consolidation of peace among the diverse ethnic and religious communities of the Emirate.\n\nIn his remarks, El-Rufa\u2019i acknowledged the President\u2019s investments in security in the area, noting in particular that the establishment of security outfits, had paved the way for reduced attacks on people, stating categorically that Kafanchan was much safer today than it used to be.\n\nThe Emir, in acknowledging the improvements in security in the area, requested permanent bases for the Air Force and the Mobile Police, as well as the restoration of the rail services for which Kafanchan was known.\n\nBuhari was welcomed to the community by the Senator and Members of the House of Representatives from the zone, as well as a large crowd of enthusiastic citizens, who thronged the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, a combined team of heavily armed soldiers and the police were deployed to strategic places in the state while helicopters were seen hovering around the city.\n\nKaduna is one of the northwest states under constant attacks by bandits with people being killed or abducted almost on a daily basis.\n\nBuhari is expected to be in Zaria today to commission more road projects under the Urban Renewal Programme.\n\nCuriously, however, the visit was without the usual fanfare and celebrations as not many people came out on the street to welcome him.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert heavy strain on the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is proposing a $50 billion trust fund which could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries to build resilience and sustainability.\n\nThe trust fund is part of IMF\u2019s options for channeling some of the $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued in August 2021 to countries with strong external financial positions as well as vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).\n\nThe IMF in a new blog post yesterday, stated that the proposed $50 billion trust fund could help low-income and vulnerable middle-income countries build resilience to balance of payments shocks and ensure a sustainable recovery\n\nIt stated that about three quarters of IMF\u2019s membership could qualify for the RST financing, including all low-income countries, all developing and vulnerable small states, and all middle-income countries with per capita gross national income (GNI) below 10 times the 2020\n\nInternational Development Association (IDA) operational cut-off , or about $12,000.\n\nNigeria falls within the category of potential beneficiaries as\n\nGNI per capita in the country was reported at $2,157 in 2019, based on the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognised sources.\n\nTo qualify for RST support, an eligible IMF member would need a package of high-quality policy measures consistent with the RST\u2019s purpose; a concurrent financing or non-financing IMF-supported programme with appropriate macroeconomic policies to mitigate risks for borrowers and creditors; and sustainable debt and adequate capacity to repay the Fund.\n\nThe IMF noted that access to RST financing would be determined case-by-case, based on the strength of reforms and debt sustainability considerations, and was expected to be capped at 150 per cent of IMF quota or SDR 1 billion, whichever is smaller.\n\nIt added that RST lending would be part of a broader financing strategy members would pursue to address longer-term balance of payments risks, involving a mix of multilateral, bilateral official, and private financing.\n\nLike the IMF\u2019s highly concessional and currently zero interest rate Trust for low-income countries, the RST\u2019s resources would be mobilised on a voluntary basis from members who wish to channel their SDRs or currencies for the benefit of poorer or vulnerable countries.\n\nThe IMF stated: \u201cEven as countries continue to battle COVID-19, it is crucial not to overlook the longer-term challenge of transforming economies to become more resilient to shocks and achieve sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has taught us that not addressing these long-term challenges in a timely manner can have significant economic consequences, with the potential for future balance of payments problems.\n\n\u201cClimate change is another long-term challenge that threatens macroeconomic stability and growth in many countries through natural disasters and disruptions to industries, job markets, and trade flows, among others.\n\n\u201cThese are global public policy challenges, and it is the shared responsibility of individual countries and the international community to take timely actions.\u201d\n\nThe Fund noted that in a previous blog, it had explained how it was considering options for channeling some of the $650 billion SDRs issued in August 2021 from countries with strong external financial positions to vulnerable countries through a Resilience and Sustainability Trust.\n\nIt added that the RST\u2019s central objective was to provide affordable long-term financing to support countries as they tackle structural challenges.\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019ve continued to work toward developing the RST, our current thinking on the key design features\u2014which we outline further below\u2014aim to balance the needs of potential contributors and borrowing countries.\n\n\u201cWith broad support from the membership and international partners, we hope that the Trust can be approved by the IMF Executive Board before the upcoming Spring Meetings and for it to become fully operational before the year\u2019s end,\u201d the IMF stated in the blog post.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nThis lengthy time frame jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about a year and a half, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. The same year he exited his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\n\n\nChari warehouses\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\n\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy me out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for me,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Moni Africa leverages social trust to finance mobile money agents",
          "text": "Over the past few years, the agency banking industry in Nigeria has grown by leaps and bounds, driven by a group of fintech players\u2014including OPay, TeamApt, and Paga\u2014that dominate the landscape as well as commercial banks. The latter boasts extensive agent networks for last-mile delivery of financial services, especially in areas where it makes little economic sense to set up branches.\n\nAgency banking is a branch of mobile payments and a major enabler in Nigeria has been the central bank-led Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) initiative, which makes it relatively easy to become an agent. Essentially, anyone with a shop can serve as an agent for a bank or a mobile payments company. Today, at least 60% of Nigerian agent outlets double as retail stores and informal traders with a POS device in their possession.\n\nWith more than 230,000 agents in Nigeria, as of 2019, the growing network is a crucial distribution channel for financial services while providing a means of livelihood for the agents themselves. But to operate profitably, constant access to working capital, in cash, is required almost every time as the bulk of transactions done through POS are withdrawals. However, most agents do not have such liquidity and end up accruing 20\u201330% in expense to rebalance and manage liquidity.\n\nFemi Iromini, a former World Bank consultant, first learned about this problem in early 2020, through a family friend who\u2019d started a mobile money business, which he invested in, and noticed was always in need of cash. \u201cAfter two to three months of launch, the business had expanded but there was always that demand for cash to meet transaction targets,\u201d Iromini said in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFollowing a conversation in November 2020 with a cluster of mobile money agents in the Shapati community in Lekki-Ajah, Lagos, one thing was clear to Iromini: liquidity is a major challenge plaguing the mobile money ecosystem. He then teamed up with Dapo Sobayo, who has experience in transforming legacy systems to digital from co-building businesses like Zedvance and SEL Capital, to launch Moni\u2014a float-as-a-service startup that offers low-interest loans to communities of mobile money agents through a referral and trust vetting system\u2014last year.\n\n\u201cWhen we met them, the pain was there. Several complaints of long queues at banks,\u201d Iromini told TechCabal. \u201cIf you start a mobile money business with \u20a6200,000, you might need to visit the bank almost daily because you\u2019ll run out of cash.\u201d This can be daunting in areas where bank branches are scarce and agency banking is needed the most. Agents face a significant risk of theft and long queues while journeying to rebalance their accounts and might lose the customers\u2019 trust when they frequently turn down cash requests.\n\n99.9% repayment rate\u2026so far\n\nAcross Africa, many startups are solving the float problem for small businesses in one form or another. What makes Moni Africa unique is that while its peers rely on databases of local credit bureaus to give out loans (and record alarming default rates of at least 30%), the startup operates a community lending system it claims has helped achieve a 99.9% repayment rate.\n\nUnder this system, Iromini explains that groups of lenders, usually women and traders, have communal relations, share joint responsibility for loans collectively taken, and make sure one another doesn\u2019t default to ensure the sustainability of the line of credit.\n\nMoni was built on this fundamental socioeconomic behavior, that emerging markets are naturally community-based, as against lending based on statements of accounts or credit ratings, which most underbanked agents don\u2019t have. The startup instead leverages an algorithm developed around social trust and social underwriting that\u2019s seen the platform achieve a highly impressive repayment rate.\n\n\u201cSocial intelligence is something you can\u2019t get from statements of accounts so we are able to combine that offline intel with our online intel. We\u2019ve had a case where an agent wanted to use the loan obtained for a wedding but through social intelligence, we were able to stop it,\u201d Sobayo, who serves as the startup\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), said.\n\nThe social underwriting model by Moni operates alongside a referral plan through which agents are continuously compensated on every loan repaid by every agent they refer. This gives them a sense of extra caution with referrals as not only is their commission at stake if the agent defaults, they might also not be able to access loans subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn our agent referral plan, we don\u2019t do automatic or express selection. Our algorithm selects 1% of 1% who are trustworthy. Once invited to the platform, we give you a business performance test and we have a simple benchmark of what your numbers should be like if you\u2019ve been doing business for a certain number of years,\u201d the CTO added.\n\nMoni Africa co-founders, Femi Iromini (left) and Dapo Sobayo.\n\nStarting out, Moni disbursed over 1,000 loans using WhatsApp and Google form before eventually building out the mobile platform that fulfils agent credit requests in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIn less than a year since it launched, Moni has spread across all states in Nigeria and has also expanded to Benin Republic and Guinea. The platform has been able to disburse over $5 million (\u20a62 billion) through 10,000 loans to thousands of agents, with a team strength of 12-13 members; 60% of which are focused on engineering.\n\nMoni Africa claims its revenue has grown 50% month-on-month so far and most of its agents, about 70% of which are women, have grown their businesses by 3x. \u201cMost agents on the Moni network start with an average working capital of \u20a6100,000 but grow to like \u20a6700,000 or \u20a61 million,\u201d Iromini said.\n\nIts 0.1% default rate, according to the CEO, can be attributed to the platform\u2019s community-based model and interest rate which supports the unit economics of a mobile money agent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a quality network of agents that love our product and have built that social trust with our brand so we can distribute other products like savings, commerce, payments, etc. through them because trust is a currency you spend,\u201d he said.\n\nMoni Africa recently got admitted into YCombinator and has closed a pre-seed round from leading investors such as MAGIC Fund, Voltron Capital, Ventures Platform, ex-Managing Partner of Softbank\u2019s Latin America fund, Murtaza Ahmed, Ventures Kinetics, Aidi Ventures, Kola Aina, among others. In the long run, the startup plans to expand its community-finance model beyond mobile money agents to different SMEs across Africa.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is delighted to back Moni as they solve a major pain point of agent banking networks, across Africa \u2014 liquidity. The infusion of social trust into Moni\u2019s products is unique and we\u2019re confident that the team will build an economic infrastructure that would impact underserved sectors across Africa,\u201d said Temi Awogboro, the Fund\u2019s General Partner, Africa.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Oxfordbuildbay wants you to easily own land, no matter how much you earn",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was with great joy in her heart that she put pen to paper and signed the document, officially making her a landowner in Lagos State, Nigeria. It\u2019s been a lifelong dream of hers, and she couldn\u2019t believe it was actually unfolding before her eyes. She looked at her son, Stephen, who smiled back, beaming with pride.\n\nUnfortunately, this joy would be short-lived. Sadly, Mrs Nwachukwu fell victim to the product of years of anarchy and regulatory laxity and lost the land she bought with her hard-earned money. This experience left a bad taste with Stephen, and he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he needed to find a solution and immediately contacted his friend, Olamilekan.\n\nThis experience was not unique to Olamilekan Adeniji and Stephen Nwachuckwu, Co-founders of Oxfordbuildbay, a real estate tech startup working to solve problems they\u2019ve experienced first hand.\n\n\u201cWe found that there\u2019s a constant issue around omo onile (traditional landowners), there\u2019s the issue around finding out who actually owns the land. God help you, you might not even get it, or they take you to somewhere farther than you had bargained for.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter this experience, we began thinking of ways to use technology to make land ownership more seamless, and affordable for the average Nigerian,\u201d says Nwachukwu\n\nThe entry barrier to real estate in Nigeria is significantly high for speculative investors and those who simply want their own homes. A 2019 survey of 5,000 Nigerians showed that 62 \u2013 63% of owned land comes by family inheritance, and just 18% bought theirs outrightly.\n\nNigeria\u2019s housing deficit is more pronounced in urban areas than rural areas. Due to the high living costs, lands in places like Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt are prohibitively expensive.\n\nHomeownership stands at 73% in rural areas, compared to 35% in urban areas. Increasing urban migration and continued pressure on infrastructure is worsening Nigeria\u2019s property ownership situation.\n\nIf you check these listings on Jiji, for example, you\u2019ll find a plot of land in Lekki, Lagos, going for \u20a612 billion ($29 million). More than enough money to bankroll the Series A rounds for Paystack and Flutterwave. But you\u2019ll also see a listing as low as \u20a6140,000 in a less developed part of Lagos.\n\nRegardless of what you opt for, you\u2019d still have to deal with uncertainties and the disturbances of omo oniles, who people have come to regard as louts.\n\nSo far, regulatory attention has not featured as effectively as it should in Nigeria\u2019s property space, but Adeniji and Nwachukwu were not about to wait for the government to set things right.\n\nToday, the company they built offers people the chance to pay for lands with as little as \u20a6250 daily for two years, after which it becomes fully theirs. But the journey was a tough one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBraving stormy waters\n\nComing from a background in finance, Nwachukwu sought out Adeniji, who had entrepreneurial experience, to seek a solution for people with similar stories to his mum\u2019s. Nwachukwu recounts that he attended Techpoint Inspired 2019, and he and his partner were inspired to build a product that would solve Nigeria\u2019s housing problems. They called it Buildbay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounders of Oxfordbuildbay: Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth (left), Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 MD (right). Source: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the failure of regulations, but we felt there was something we could do to solve the problem. First, we thought we could excuse the omo oniles, so you could trust that the land you buy from the comfort of your home is actually genuine and is verifiable,\u201d Nwachukwu says.\n\nAdeniji points out that it would be very difficult to verify if the omo onile selling a property to you is the actual owner of that land.\n\n\u201cMaybe someone leads you to another person, who then takes you to another family who owns the land. There are always long chains like these,\u201d he reveals.\u201cWhen a company approaches the government to get land, or they approach these same omo oniles, it\u2019s usually a different ball game than when an individual approaches them.\n\nAdeniji opines that the idea was to create a safety net for individuals who do not have the financial might or connection to fend off bullies and poachers from their properties.\n\nFor this to happen, the two founders had to acquire large amounts of land and sort out issues with the omo oniles themselves. If you\u2019ve followed my analysis this far, you can surmise that this would cost a ton of money.\n\nWith no venture capital funding, Buildbay got in talks with Oxford International Group, a multisectoral business empire, that bought into the founders\u2019 vision and absorbed Buildbay to birth the company, Oxfordbuildbay.\n\nWith the platform fully launched, the company had to find ways to onboard users who would appreciate the solution it came up with.\n\n\u201cWe had to leverage the real estate agent network who penetrated deep into the market and pretty much helped onboard people on the platform we built. These guys would go into markets, schools, and several other places. We also had to employ cooperatives because they had a large number of people who would need the products we were offering,\u201d Adeniji explains.\n\nWith the resounding success of this aggressive offline marketing, the company could automate the whole process and limit human interaction as much as possible. Customers could now take their pick of land across Lagos, Ogun, and Oyo and pay with their cards or connect their accounts, so they are automatically debited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nAnother major issue the startup had to tackle was the reputation of hidden charges among real estate developers. To do this, it took up the task of educating people.\n\nLike most founders, getting the right talent became paramount, and they actively sought people who would buy into the company\u2019s vision.\n\nIt looked for talent in industries similar to theirs but also took bets on teachable people who displayed a willingness to learn.\n\n\u201cSometimes we found that the people we hired had bought the product before, so selling our vision to them was a no-brainer,\u201d Adeniji states excitedly.\n\nThis strategy, Adeniji opines, has helped Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s mission so far.\n\nHow Oxfordbuildbay works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxfordbuildbay has optimised its entire process to work for the different kinds of visitors to its website.\n\n\u201cWhen less tech-savvy users head to the website, www.oxfordbuildbay.com, there\u2019s a WhatsApp popup that is so in your face. When you click it, it links you to a support agent who then walks you through the whole process from start to finish,\u201d Nwachukwu explains.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, you could simply create an account, log in to your dashboard, click on the land locations, which will bring out the different land locations we have as of today, and then click on buy. It takes you to the cart, and you also get to choose your payment frequency before you pay.\n\nTypically, getting lands from real estate developers usually comes with other hidden or inexplicable charges, but Nwachukwu insists that there\u2019s nothing of the sort with Oxfordbuildbay.\n\n\u201cAll of these with zero allocation fee, zero agency fee, zero documentation fee and allocation can be between the 6th and 12th months while the payment is ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put that in perspective, we\u2019ve helped Nigerians save over N2.3 billion on agency, legal and \u2018omo onile\u2019 fees when acquiring a land,\u201d claims Nwachukwu.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve made the payment, you get an offer letter which gives the purchase details \u2014 the size of land you bought, the location you picked, what you have paid, and what is left to pay.\u201d\n\nOxfrordbuildbay measures its lands in small units called \u201cSlots\u201d, which is half a plot. Its plots are usually 300 square metres on Lagos Mainland and everywhere else, and 250 square metres on the Island.\n\nThere are regularly scheduled site inspection visits at different intervals, and any customer can request an inspection for a small fee.\n\nThe startup recently launched its Android app, and its IoS app, creating a fresh avenue for users to access the platform, and begin their land ownership.\n\nBusiness model and expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: Akinyinka Akinpelu \u2013 Head of Business, Stephen Nwachukwu \u2013 CFO/ Head of Growth, Olamilekan Adeniji \u2013 Managing Director and CEO, Oxfordbuildbay. Source: Supplied.\n\nWithout sharing any specific figures, Nwachukwu insists that Oxfordbuilbay\u2019s entire process ensures that the company is profitable.\n\nHe argues that the company\u2019s business model allows it to capture people from different rungs of the social ladder, and it\u2019s helping to create constant cash flow and make the business sustainable.\n\n\u201cWe have people who are upstream financially who are interested in the trust and certainty we offer, as well as people who are looking for affordable and flexible options to own a property.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu likens this strategy to the sachet milk strategy. He states that the company has already acquired huge expanses of land over time, these lands have appreciated, and it made perfect business sense to sell them in little affordable bits.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about it, it all adds up,\u201d he chuckles, \u201cour mission to democratise homeownership is quite different from any other player out there.\u201d\n\nIt has also put systems in place to deter people from defaulting on payments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say life happens, we wait for 1, 2, and 3 months and there\u2019s still no payment, we adjust the pricing for the land, so you start paying for the land at a reviewed price that factors in land appreciation. Customers who do not default continue to pay for the land at the price it was when they started paying.\u201d\n\nSeveral other factors could lead people to default on payments in a country like Nigeria, and Oxfordbuildbay has a little fail-safe.\n\n\u201cKnowing that health can be a major deterrent when making long term payments like this, we have partnered with an HMO to offer free health insurance to customers who consistently pay for three months.\u201d\n\nWhile this might seem quite generous, the company has an end goal in mind. As Nwachukwu pointed out earlier, the margins actually make sense at the end.\n\n\u201cLike any business, we obviously want to make a profit. But our primary goal is to democratise homeownership and become the brand that Africans come to for their homeownership needs.\u201d\n\nSo far, Nwachukwu reveals that the company has been bootstrapping, but it is looking for funding to expand its offerings which are fast gaining traction across West Africa.\n\nOxfordbuildbay has 20,000 consistent customers, and it has visions of expanding across Nigeria and to other African countries.\n\nNigeria\u2019s property sector has been filled with exciting innovations in recent years, but Oxfordbuildbay\u2019s value proposition is quite compelling, and it creates room for excitement and possibly other similar down-to-earth solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

However, in 2021, it was ranked 163rd out of 191.\n\nWhile this indicates a slow improvement in the country\u2019s health system, only over 10 million out of a growing population of 200 million Nigerians are currently covered by health insurance. This is done through various programmes by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), state health insurance agencies, and private plans run by Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Despite the fact that some Nigerians are more health conscious \u2014 particularly as a result of technological advancement \u2014 over 170 million people do not have a health insurance plan.\n\nDespite the various insurance companies available, due to poverty and ignorance, few Nigerians have insurance coverage for their homes, cars, lives, and other aspects of their lives.\n\nInsurpass, an API solution insurtech startup, wants to assist Nigerians in getting insurance.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole spoke with the co-founders, who explained how the company plans to increase insurance adoption in the country.\n\nPlease, read it here: With its API infrastructure and agent network, Insurpass wants to increase insurance adoption in Nigeria\n\nInstagram\u2019s Remix for public content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram announced yesterday, Thursday, January 20, 2022, that users will be able to remix any public video content on the app, not just short-form reel videos.\n\nWhat exactly does this indicate? Any public video on Instagram is fair game for a remix. Also, it only applies to videos that were made public as of yesterday and not to content created prior to the day it was announced.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this launch? The company stated that the expansion made sense after seeing how well Remix has been received by Reels users. It wanted to provide more opportunities for creators to \u201creinvent their content\u201d and collaborate with others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen remixing a non-Reels video, creators will still have access to Reels\u2019 set of creative tools, such as Collabs, Voiceover, Effects, and Audio Tools.\n\nHow can you use this feature? Users can access the new feature by tapping the three-dot menu in the upper-right corner of any public Instagram video published after the update goes live. Then, select \u201cRemix this video\u201d and record your response or upload a video from your phone\u2019s camera roll.\n\nCreator\u2019s can remix all or a portion of another person\u2019s video and download it as part of the remix. The final remixed video will be visible wherever you share your reels.\n\nIs this something you\u2019ve seen before? Yes, it\u2019s similar to YouTube Shorts which allows creators to sample audio from other people\u2019s videos for use on their own.\n\nChari\u2019s bridge round at $100 million valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nChari, a Moroccan B2B e-commerce and retail startup, has raised a bridge round at a $100 million valuation.\n\nThe round saw participation from Khwarizmi Ventures, Air Angels, Y Combinator, Rocket Internet, Global Founders Capital, Plug n Play, Orange Ventures, Harvard University Management Company, Village Capital and P1 Ventures, and Afri Mobility \u2014 the venture capital arm of the AKWA Group.\n\nFounded by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (co-founder) in 2020, Chari is a mobile app that enables small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from FMCG multinationals and local manufacturers, receiving them in less than 24 hours.\n\nInterestingly, a Moroccan ledger book, Karny.ma, was acquired by the company in 2021. The platform offers credit and bookkeeping services to approximately 50,000 merchants. It enables these merchants to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nThe acquisition of Karny and the bridge round are part of Chari\u2019s strategy to provide payment facilities. The company claims the strategy puts them in a good position to offer financial services to their retailers, particularly buy now, pay later (BNPL)\n\nAccording to the CEO, the company plans to test the BNPL services with its existing customers using the funds from the bridge round.\n\nMore so, if the results are positive, Chari will acquire a local credit company to allow shop owners to lend money to their end-users and grow their business. It also plans to expand this BNPL service to Tunisia and other French-speaking countries in Africa.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat it really means to live your best life.

          "title": "Who needs a brand culture?",
          "text": "Brand culture is a type of company culture that is completely aligned with a brand. It is also referred to as organizational culture. It shapes the actions and decisions of all members of an organisation. Thus, the brand culture impacts the entire management and employee leadership cycle. When a company uses the brand culture as its central management system, it benefits from long-term advantages. Brand culture is a brand-centric company or organisation culture, rooted in the brand identity, which consists of shared values and a vision.\n\nThe brand core values also play a crucial part in the whole picture. These are the very heart of every brand\u2014and therefore the core of every strong company culture. These values define the right action framework for relationships, communication and employee performances. But we don\u2019t mean social or ethical values. Nor are we talking about wishful thinking about how a company would like to be perceived. Also, these values are not instruments for solving problems with the way people work together and make decisions.\n\nBrand core values are what defines, characterises and specifies a company. They arise from peak performances the company has delivered over a long period of time. These are performances the company is proud of and identifies with. Such performances stir emotions and are not questioned\u2014they are simply believed. This firm belief is the foundation of a company\u2019s brand identity.\n\nEvery company culture is rooted in condensed peak performances, whether consciously or subconsciously. However, it is essential for the company to know its own special performances and align its actions accordingly. They shape its characteristics, specifics and success factors.\n\nApart from the peak performances, a company\u2019s vision also provides orientation and clarity, as long as that vision differentiates the company from the competition and is attractive to all relevant stakeholders. It is the company\u2019s vision that makes it an attractive employer that people want to work with, a preferred investment that people are willing to put their money into and turn its products and services to consumers\u2019 number one choice.\n\nRead also: Performance branding\n\nBrand Culture is a Management System\n\nAll these foundations give rise to a brand culture. Correctly understood, it is a management system that tells all those involved who they are and how to act. In short: how to behave in line with the brand. What this means in detail is that everyone involved knows the company\u2019s values and strategic direction and align their decisions with them.\n\nPeople identify with the values and/or the vision of the company. Brand-conform behaviour is ranked above the functional and the individual. Management staffs live and lead by the values and expect the same of their employees. Employees and potential applicants are compelled and inspired; they stay with the company long-term. Brand core values are more than just empty phrases to print on posters and brochures for effect. They are a central control element for the entire management and employee leadership cycle: from strategy development to company processes, from innovation design to sales, from onboarding to offboarding, from analogue to digital.\n\nThe result is brand-conform behaviour that is lived and expressed subconsciously. All involved have the necessary understanding of their company\u2019s vision and identify with it. Because the company culture has a profound impact on all areas of a business, it should never be considered separately from strategic developments. Otherwise, what Peter Drucker warned about will happen: \u201cCulture eats strategy for breakfast.\u201d\n\nBenefits of a Brand Culture\n\nIn such a culture, it is not monetary but value-based incentives that count. A company benefits permanently from a brand culture that reflects its brand one hundred percent: It remains stable through management changes, attracts the right employees and retains them. Its competitive edge improves, customers become fans and evangelists. In addition, the brand culture ensures that the company does not pursue every new trend that comes along. That is the reason why you have brands that have been around for decades, and some for centuries.\n\nLast line \u2026\n\nAccording to renowned researcher, Edgar Schein, such a culture is the result of learning together. It makes management decisions more transparent, stabilises relationships between employees, increases the trust of all stakeholders and makes the company more attractive to the desired target groups. It makes family businesses inheritable. Simply put, a brand culture makes an organisation successful long-term.",

          "text": "Fifty-seven goals have been scored in 30 games, making for an average of 1.9 goals per match. Going by the number of goals set in the previous edition, the players have to score 72 goals in the remaining 22 games.\n\nWhat is responsible for the low turnout of goals?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) or the tactics employed, or the quality of the players\u2026. Indulge me a little; the English Premier League (EPL) and Ligue Un UberEats have the highest number of contingents with 40 and 56 players respectively, 102 is the total number of delegations from the various leagues in Europe. With these in mind, it\u2019s difficult to accept that Africa lacks the quality to \u201cburst\u201d the net with many \u201cwho dey breathe\u201d goals.\n\nAliou Cisse (Senegal) and Kaba Diawara (Guinep deployed a three-person anchor in midfield in addition to an entirely \u201cflat\u201d squad. One can only wonder when African football will move from \u201csenior man footie\u201d to a more sophisticated. Carlos Queiroz (Egypt) expects Mohammed Salah to perform miracles when it\u2019s not Sallah day; the squad is so essential that his goal against Guinea-Bissau was his first in 6 games!\n\nYou need to watch Ghana play to see how abysmal they are; one might just stick to only Ghana Jollof at this rate, lol. One of the striking things in their match against Comoros was the number of times I saw Daniel Amartey, Jordan and Andre Ayew, Andy Yiadom, and Thomas Partey argued about roles, positioning, and passes on the pitch \u2013 which might suggest internal squabbles and perhaps lack of understanding of the coach\u2019s game plan and tactics. Comoros had three shots on target and scored with all 3 to condemn Ghana to a humiliating tournament exit.\n\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire boasts of the best legs in this AFCON with the highest goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League in the man of S\u00e9bastien Haller,,,,, who has a measly one goal so far and the most sought after midfielder in Serie A; Franck Kessi\u00e9, I can\u2019t seem to shake the feeling of the players coming back to the continent with some \u201cagba football mentality.\u201d I\u2019m hoping that their match against the defending champions, Algeria,,, will be explosive so that we can have some worthy ticket display from the bigwigs.\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria to reward fans with free tickets to watch AFCON final\n\nThe VAR has been generating controversy based on its use and adjudication. For example, Mali vs\u2026 Tunisia was halted for full time by referee Janny Sikazwe is the 89th minute with 11 seconds to average regulation time excluding added time. The tournament officials tried to restart the match 40 minutes after it \u201cended,\u201d but the Tunisian players didn\u2019t take to the field. However; Mali won 1-0 courtesy of a second-half penalty by Ibrahima Kone.\n\nVAR disallowed what appeared to be a clean goal scored by Guinea-Bissau in their 1-0 defeat against Egypt on Saturday. The Pharaohs lost their group opener 1- 0 to Nigeria, took the lead courtesy of Mohammed Salah in the 69th minute, but the Djurtus found the back of th net in the 84th minute through Mama Balde only for referee Pacifique Ndabihawenimana to chalk it off later after consulting VAR. It was a significant relief for Egypt as they went on to pick up their first three points in the clash at Roumde Adjia Stadium and stay on course to reach the knockout stage in Cameroon. The decision to disallow Balde\u2019s goal has me baffled because football is a physical sport and many scenarios are 50/50. The referees act incompetent and wait for a sign from above (VAR) before dispensing their duties.\n\nIn the current tournament, VAR\u2019s decisions include the penalty awarded to Cameroon during the tournament\u2019s Group A opener, which striker Vincent Aboubakar converted to help the Indomitable Lions come from a goal down and beat Burkina Faso 2-1 at Olembe Stadium.\n\nOn Saturday, the video system also awarded a penalty to Sudan, who scored but lost 3-1 against Nigeria in a Group D battle at Roumde Adjia Stadium. In fact, in the last game, referee Victor Gomes needed VAR to confirm if a play was a corner kick to Nigeria or a goal kick to Sudan; that\u2019s never part of the functions of VAR set out by The International Football Association Board (IFAB).\n\nSome quarters think that the poor quality of some of the pitches are factors to be considered at par with the amateurish displays that have come to be a norm in this tournament; it can be argued that it contributed to the howler from Ali Sangare while in goal for Cote d\u2019Ivoire that gifted Sierra Leone an equalizer.\n\nDid I hear you say minnows?\n\nCape Verde held the host nation, Cameroon, to a 1-1 draw while Equatorial Guinea defeated the defending champions, Algeria 1-0. Sierra Leone and her goalie, Mohammed Kamara, have provided some of the finest displays. Elsewhere, Comoros made the phrase \u201cGhana Must Go\u201d a reality with a superb display of wit and guile to send Ghana packing in a 3-2 victory, while Gabon has been gliding without iririrtheir helptalisman; Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me haven\u2019t turned up in this championship; one can only hope they aren\u2019t here to catch \u201ccruise.\u201d\n\nStrict Health Protocol and low fan turnout\n\nThere are several reasons why fans aren\u2019t showing up to the stadiums. The main one is undoubtedly the heavy health protocol adopted by CAF and the Local Organising Committee (LOC) to limit the spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe rules are stringent, and many clubs \u2013 particularly European ones \u2013 have demanded that their players participate in the competition with the regulations in place. Only those who have been duly vaccinated, and have tested negative for the virus within the last 48 hours, can attend the matches.\n\nSince the exceptional crowd of the opening match of 9th January because of Cameroon\u2019s host nation\u2019s team, the temperature has dropped following the lack of public supporters in the various stadiums. An hour after the match between the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon and the Stallions of Burkina Faso, the stands of the Olembe stadium had already emptied when the Ethiopian and Cape Verdean players came onto the pitch.\n\nIn Bafoussam stadium, where the matches of one of the favourites, Senegal, are played; in Mfandena, where Morocco is housed; in Douala Japoma stadium, Algeria played its first match on 11th January, none of them could bring in enough people! So far, the only exception: the duel between Nigeria and Egypt, which was played at the Roumde Adja stadium in Garoua, filled for the occasion up to the 60% authorised by CAF.\n\nIn a country where less than 2.5% of the population had taken their dosage a week before AFCON kicked off, the vaccination requirement excludes a large proportion of potential fans.\n\nThe schedules of some of the matches during this first phase of the competition \u2013 as early as 2 pm for some \u2013 and the price of tickets are also an issue. Depending on the category, tickets range from 3,000 to 8,000 CFA francs (about 5 to 14 dollars).\n\nAs the competition progresses, the prices go up: 5,000 \u2013 15,000 CFA francs in the quarter-finals.\n\nFor in the quarter-finals in the quarter-finals in the quarter-finals in the quarter-finals their, final, the precious tickets will cost between 7,000 \u2013 20,000 CFA francs. These prices might be steep for many football fans in Cameroon, so they might just end up watching at home or a nearby pub-like \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d\n\nThe TV rights for the AFCON in the UK are split between Sky Sports and BBC. There\u2019s room for a lot more improvement on the part of organisers, coaches, players, and media if we\u2019re to see the AFCON that we truly deserve.\n\nThe following players have been my standout performers:\n\nGK \u2013 Mohammed Kamara (Sierra Leone)\n\nRB \u2013 Ola Aina (Nigeria)\n\nRCB \u2013 Esteban Obiang (Equatorial Guinea)\n\nLCB \u2013 Mohammed Camara (Guinea)\n\nLB \u2013 Zaidu Sanusi (Nigeria)\n\nCM \u2013 Selim Amallah (Morocco)\n\nCM \u2013 Wilfred Ndidi (Nigeria)\n\nCM \u2013 Franck Kessi\u00e9 (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire)\n\nRW \u2013 Wahbi Khazri (Tunisia)\n\nST \u2013 Vincent Aboubakar (Cameroon)\n\nLW \u2013 Moses Simon (Nigeria)\n\nOginni Noah, @Otunbaoflagos_",
          "summary": "Maybe it\u2019s the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) or the tactics employed, or the quality of the players\u2026.\nWith these in mind, it\u2019s difficult to accept that Africa lacks the quality to \u201cburst\u201d the net with many \u201cwho dey breathe\u201d goals.\nAliou Cisse (Senegal) and Kaba Diawara (Guinep deployed a three-person anchor in midfield in addition to an entirely \u201cflat\u201d squad.\nVAR disallowed what appeared to be a clean goal scored by Guinea-Bissau in their 1-0 defeat against Egypt on Saturday.\nThe decision to disallow Balde\u2019s goal has me baffled because football is a physical sport and many scenarios are 50/50.",

Vincent Aizebeoje Balogun have called on the Federal Government to create a favourable environment for the green manufacturing technology sector to thrive.\n\nAnd to develop the green manufacturing technology through the use of its local content technology for the production of goods in the manufacturing sector.\n\nEngr. Prof. Balogun, made the call while delivering his paper titiled Green Manufacturing: A Novel Approach to Economic Recovery in Nigeria, at the 3rd Inaugural lecture series of the Edo State University Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government, Edo State.\n\nThe Don said Nigeria should capitalized on her population of over 200 million people in order to explore, penetrate and create strong market for its manufacturing sector.\n\nBalogun a Professor in the Deparment of Mechanical Engeering, Edo State University Uzairue said the solution to economic poverty in the country is technological revolution and self sufficiently in the production of green consumer goods which can only be avhieved through green manufacturing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe way forward is for Nigeria to take advantage of the green manufacturing strategy and evolve her manufacturing sector in that direction as we move toward s the 4th industrial revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state of manufacturing machining in our nation to be specific needs a step change to enhance sustainability and transformation towards green,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe, as a nation, cannot continue to depend on imported technology and food, and expect to be classified as a developed nation.\n\n\u201cRather, we need to employ and develop our green manufacturing sector so that we can create more jobs and take our citizens out of the streets\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Balogun noted that the manufacturing sector provides the greatest opportunity for the transformation of the Nigerian economy, saying that it is an antidote for unemployment, a creator of wealth and threshold for sustainable development.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough manufacturing in Nigeria has a few challenges; among them are inadequate and epileptic power supply, regulatory issues, multiplicities of taxes, trade facilitation issues and infrastructural deficiencies.\n\n\u201cThere are some area of strengths that Nigeria could build on if she considers the new trend of green manufacturing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further described green manufacturing as a products through economically-sound processes that minimise negative environmental impact while conserving energy and natural resources.\n\n\u201cGreen manufacturing is a gateway and key to competitive economy. The competitiveness of manufacturing and support for sustainable development demand new aporoaches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an urgret call at all levels of manufacturing to curtail the emission rate as proposed by United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to meet the sustsinable agenda in order to help cushion the impact of electrical energy consumption on the environment during manufacturing processes\u201d he said.\n\nThe Don said that green manufacturing technology are increasingly becoming more attractive globally for the production of consumer products, adding that it minimises and eliminates processing and production waste using eco-efficient practices and new environmental technology at all levels of manufacturing activities.\n\nHe said Nigerian manufacturing sector contributes 4.19 per cent to the national GDP, saying that for Nigeria to be one of the 20 biggest economies in the world in 2020, the sector must be contributing a minimum of 15 per cent yearly to its GDP and grow it steadily to a minimum of 30 per cent by 2021.\n\nHe urged manufacturers operating in the country to key into the green manufacturing technology for the manufacturing of their products.\n\n\u201cGreen manufacturing is a national call to the development of environmentally friendly manufacturing factor, concepts, methods and tools that are important in design and manufacturing of discrete products in order to minimise the life cycle cost due to environmental demage.\n\n\u201cFor green manufacturing to thrive, there has to be an understanding and advocacy on the modus operandi towards green mechanical machining processes.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore compelling on all manufacturers including Nigerian manufacturers to engage in discussion that boils around the reduction of CO2 levels through the minimum consumption of fossil fuels and other parameters to encourage green manufsctures of products,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

For example,in Bangladesh, the ocean economy consists of the following broad and growing economic sectors; living resources, minerals,energy, transport trade, tourism and recreation, carbon sequestration and coastal protection. These industries and ecosystem services do not develop in isolation, but rather interact as an economic ecosystem\u201d the VP said.\n\nIn his opening remark, Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi said the blue economy is capable of improving government revenue, create employments and grow the gross domestic product of Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi who was represented by Dr Magdalene Ajani, Permanent Secretary of the ministry also expressed optimism in the copious benefits derivable from a well exploited marine environment\n\nSpeaking at the event, Dr. Paul Adalikwu, Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA) lauded initiative of the expansion while recommending inclusion of financial institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN), African Development Bank (AfDB) and key financial institutions that will contribute meaningfully to realizing Nigeria\u2019s Blue Economy objective.\n\nAside maritime agencies like Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Maritime Academy of Nigeria, the expanded committee also comprised of ten state governors including Rivers, Lagos, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Borno, Ogun, Ondo, Cross River, Bayelsa and Edo States.\n\nOther members are Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Power, Finance, Environment, Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Water Resources , Chief of Naval Staff, Comptroller General of Customs, Lake Chad Basin Commission, Nigeria Economic Summit Group and others.\n\n...",

          "text": "Ogun State government on Friday, said it has forged a partnership with the two neighbouring states of Lagos and Oyo to tackle the menace of killer herdsmen, kidnappers as well as other bandits operating in its forests.\n\nThe chairman of the state chapter of the South West Security Network, code named \u201cAmotekun\u201d, Dave Akinyemi who spoke with newsmen yesterday in Abeokuta, the state capital said the partnership became necessary following the upsurge in criminal activities, particularly the menace of suspected Fulani herdsmen terrorising motorists on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway corridor and escaping into the forest.\n\nAkinyemi, who recalled how eight villages in the Imeko-Afon local government area of the state came under attacks of some murderous herders, particularly at Idofa village, where five persons were killed and property worth several millions of naira destroyed, also explained that the state was already collaborating with Oyo and Lagos to comb its forests and smoke out the harbingers of destruction.\n\nEmphasizing that provision of adequate security has been a cardinal and focal point of the Prince Dapo Abiodun led administration, Akinyemi, a retired police commissioner, declared that the incumbent administration in Ogun will not allow any part of the state to be taken over by terrorists, killer herdsmen, kidnappers or bandits who felt the state can be a safe haven for them to unleash mayhem on the people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoting that it will preposterous to suggest that Abiodun or any other governor from the South West has been playing politics with the lives of the people, the Amotekun chairman further stated that the Abiodun led administration was not unaware of its constitutional responsibility of securing lives and property of her citizens and is doing so in many areas.\n\nHe explained that with the resurgence in cases of kidnapping on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Amotekun personnel in Ogun and Oyo states are now combing the forests to dislodge the terrorists, a move that he said, has been yielding positive results.\n\nHe said that the state government has concluded arrangements to fortify all the 20 local government areas of the state with Amotekun operatives, adding that this will be complemented by some operatives, who recently concluded their training and are waiting to be mobilized.\n\nThe Amotekun boss also noted that the Corps has been collaborating with the Army, Police, Department of State Services (DSS), Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) among others to rid the state of criminals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe disclosed that the inter agency cooperation has led to the arrest of over 50 cultists and other hoodlums in Sagamu and other areas in Ogun East.",

So far 500 houses have been affected. Some have been razed down completely by the explosion while others have developed cracks,\u201d Sedzi Sadzi Amedonu, Deputy Coordinator of the National Disaster Management Organization, told AFP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a ghost town now.\u201d\n\nAbena Mintah, who witnessed the blast, told local media the driver of the truck dropped down from his hatch, shouting at those nearby to warn them away from the flaming vehicle.\n\n\u201cWithin a few minutes we heard a loud bang. I felt dizzy and fell in the bush. I managed to get up and saw a few dismembered bodies on the street,\u201d Mintah said.\n\nThe government said those in critical condition would be moved to hospitals in Accra and police asked surrounding villages to open their schools and churches to accommodate any additional casualties.\n\nA team of police and army explosion experts were deployed to \u201cavoid a second explosion\u201d and put in place security measures after the blast, the government said in a press release.\n\n\u2018Community Gone\u2019\n\nEmergency services were to give a casualty update on Friday at 11:00 am (1100 GMT).\n\nDr Isaac Dasmani, chief executive of the Prestea Huni-Valley municipality where the explosion occurred, told local media \u201cthe whole community is gone\u201d after the blast.\n\n\u201cAll of the roofs have been ripped off, some of the buildings have collapsed. Some were in their rooms, and were trapped. Some of them unfortunately, before we were able to rescue them, were already gone,\u201d he told Ghana\u2019s TV3 broadcaster.\n\nAuthorities have created an access route to the scene and were working to open roads on Friday to ease traffic around the blast site, he said.\n\nGhana has been rocked by several deadly explosions caused by fuel accidents in recent years.\n\nIn 2017, at least three people were killed and dozens injured after a tanker truck carrying natural gas caught fire in Accra, triggering explosions at two fuel stations and killing three people.\n\nGhana\u2019s capital was the scene of a similar fire and explosion in June 2015, when more than 150 people died as they sought shelter from seasonal rains and flooding at a petrol station.

I then asked him to try to stand up.\n\n\u201cAs he attempted to stand up, he showed signs of serious pains. I had to carry Sylvester to the car with the help of a staff member because he could not walk.\u201d\n\nThe witness testified that he called Sylvester\u2019s father, after which he took the boy to a laboratory for an X-ray examination which showed no sign of fracture.\n\nHe added that Sylvester\u2019s condition did not improve when he took him to the Oromoni family house in Abiola Court 5, Chevron, Lagos.\n\n\u201cAfter the x-ray, we went to the house after I bought hot balm and Panadol for him. I bathed him, applied the hot balm on his feet, gave him noodles, and tried to get him to sleep, but he was going through serious pain,\u201d Tejere lamented.\n\nHe narrated how he had to make a video call with the boy\u2019s father to convey the importance of what the deceased was going through.\n\nAccording to the witness, Sylvester\u2019s father came on November 25 and they decided to take the boy to Warri, Delta State.\n\nHe explained that the boy went through severe pain on their way to Warri and shortly before his death on November 30, he eventually confessed to his father that he was beaten by some boys in the school.\n\nAfter giving the testimony, the coroner adjourned the further hearing in the case until Thursday and Friday next week.",

          "title": "Russia Toughens Posture Amid Ukraine Tensions",
          "text": "With tens of thousands of Russian troops positioned near Ukraine, the Kremlin has kept the U.S. and its allies guessing about its next moves in the worst security crisis to emerge between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.\n\nAmid fears of an imminent attack on Ukraine, Russia has further upped the ante by announcing more military drills in the region. It also has refused to rule out the possibility of military deployments to the Caribbean, and President Vladimir Putin has reached out to leaders opposed to the West.\n\nThe military muscle-flexing reflects a bold attempt by the Kremlin to halt decades of NATO expansion after the end of the Cold War. In talks with the United States, Russia demands legally binding guarantees that the alliance will not embrace Ukraine and other former Soviet nations, or place weapons there. It also wants NATO to pull back its forces from countries in Central and Eastern Europe that joined the alliance since the 1990s.\n\nPutin has described NATO membership for Ukraine and the others as well as the alliance\u2019s weapons deployments there as a red line for Moscow, warning that he would order unspecified \u201cmilitary-technical measures\u201d if the demands aren\u2019t met.\n\nPutin pointed to NATO drills with the Ukrainian military, increasingly frequent visits of the alliance warships in the Black Sea and the flights of U.S. bombers near Crimea to emphasize the urgency of Russia\u2019s security demands. He argued that by creating training centers in Ukraine, Western powers can establish a military foothold there even without its joining NATO.\n\n\u201cWe have nowhere to retreat,\u201d Putin said. \u201cThey have taken it to the point where we simply must tell them: \u2018Stop!\u2019\u201d\n\nRussia, which annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, has denied it intends to attack its neighbor. Last year, however, Putin issued a stark warning that an attempt by Ukraine to reclaim control of the areas in the east controlled by Russia-backed separatists would have \u201cgrave consequences for Ukrainian statehood.\u201d\n\nWhile Ukrainian authorities denied planning such offensive, U.S. intelligence officials concluded that Russia had already deployed operatives to carry out acts of sabotage in the rebel east and blame them on Ukraine in a \u201cfalse-flag operation\u201d to create a pretext for possible invasion. Russia has rejected the claim as \u201ctotal disinformation.\u201d\n\nPutin has repeatedly asserted that Russians and Ukrainians are \u201cone people,\u201d and says large chunks of Ukrainian territory are historic parts of Russia \u2014 arbitrarily granted to Ukraine by Communist leaders during Soviet times.\n\nOver 14,000 people have been killed in nearly eight years of fighting in Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland called the Donbas, where the Moscow-supported insurgency erupted shortly after the annexation of Crimea. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany helped end large-scale battles, but a political settlement has stalled, and frequent skirmishes have continued along the tense line of contact.\n\nEarlier this year, a spike in cease-fire violations in the east and a Russian troop concentration near Ukraine ignited the invasion fears, but tensions abated when Moscow pulled back the bulk of its forces after maneuvers in April.\n\nThe military buildup near Ukraine resumed in the fall, with Ukrainian and Western officials warning that the increasing troop concentration could herald a multipronged Russian attack.\n\nPutin noted with satisfaction that Russia has caused a \u201ccertain stress\u201d in the West. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to keep them in that condition for as long as possible,\u201d he said in November, ordering his diplomats to push for binding guarantees against NATO expansion.\n\nWhile the U.S. and its allies rejected the Russian demands for a halt to NATO expansion, some observers note that Moscow\u2019s insistence on a written reply may reflect an intention to use it as an argument for a possible escalation.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, the parties don\u2019t intend to compromise and want to shift responsibility for a potential conflict,\u201d said Kirill Rogov, a Moscow-based independent analyst.\n\nAdding to an estimated 100,000 troops deployed near Ukraine, Russia also has moved more troops from Siberia and the Far East for joint drills with its ally Belarus, which also borders Ukraine. In those exercises, Russian military units have moved to areas near Belarus\u2019 southern border, which is about 75 kilometers (47 miles) from Kyiv.\n\nEarlier this week, the Russian Defense Ministry also announced a series of naval maneuvers in the Black Sea and more distant areas such as the Mediterranean, northeastern Atlantic and the Pacific. The exercises that will start this month and last through February would involve over 140 ships, dozens of aircraft and more than 10,000 personnel.\n\nAmid the tensions, Putin also worked to strengthen alliances with the countries opposed to the West. He has hosted Iran\u2019s hard-line president for talks on expanding cooperation and is set to travel to the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing where he will hold talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn recent days, Putin also spoke by phone with the leaders of Nicaragua and Venezuela, and a Russian government plane was recently seen cruising between Cuba and Venezuela in a possible harbinger of the next Kremlin moves.\n\nAfter the U.S. and its allies rejected Russia\u2019s demands for a halt to NATO expansion, Russia\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov kept the door open for the deployment of military assets to Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nWhile voicing concern that NATO could potentially use Ukrainian territory for the deployment of missiles capable of reaching Moscow in just five minutes, Putin has warned that Russian warships armed with the latest Zircon hypersonic cruise missile would give Russia a similar capability if deployed in neutral waters.\n\nFyodor Lukyanov, a leading Russian foreign policy expert, observed that with Russia and the West taking intransigent stands in the talks, an escalation appears inevitable.\n\n\u201cTensions will be high, including demonstrations of force not necessarily near or in Ukraine,\u201d Lukyanov wrote in a commentary. \u201cReal talks with some room for maneuvering and a broader agenda would ideally begin only after the next round of escalation in order to ease tensions.\u201d",

It said China\u2019s suspension of the44 flights \u201care adverse to the public interest and warrant proportionate remedial action.\u201d It added that China\u2019s \u201cunilateral actions against the named U.S. carriers are inconsistent\u201d with a bilateral agreement.\n\nChina has also suspended numerous U.S. flights by Chinese carriers after passengers later tested positive.\n\nThe department said it was prepared to revisit its action if China revised its \u201cpolicies to bring about the necessary improved situation for U.S. carriers.\u201d It warned that if China cancels more flights, \u201cwe reserve the right to take additional action.\u201d\n\nChina has all but shut its borders to travelers, cutting total international flights to just 200 a week, or 2% of pre-pandemic levels, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in September.\n\nThe number of U.S. flights being scrapped has surged since December, as infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus soared to record highs in the United States.\n\nBeijing and Washington have sparred over air services since the start of the pandemic.

          "text": "The United States, the World Health Organization\u2019s top donor, is resisting proposals to make the agency more independent, four officials involved in the talks said, raising doubts about the Biden administration\u2019s long-term support for the U.N. agency.\n\nThe proposal, made by the WHO\u2019s working group on sustainable financing, would increase each member state\u2019s standing annual contribution, according to a WHO document published online and dated Jan. 4.\n\nThe plan is part of a wider reform process galvanised by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted the limitations of the WHO\u2019s power to intervene early in a crisis.\n\nBut the U.S. government is opposing the reform because it has concerns about the WHO\u2019s ability to confront future threats, including from China, U.S. officials told Reuters.\n\nIt is pushing instead for the creation of a separate fund, directly controlled by donors, that would finance prevention and control of health emergencies.\n\nFour European officials involved in the talks, who declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, confirmed the U.S. opposition. The U.S. government had no immediate comment.\n\nThe published proposal calls for member states\u2019 mandatory contributions to rise gradually from 2024 so they would account for half the agency\u2019s $2 billion core budget by 2028, compared to less than 20% now, the document said.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s core budget is aimed at fighting pandemics and strengthening healthcare systems across the world. It also raises an additional $1 billion or so a year to tackle specific global challenges such as tropical diseases and influenza.\n\nSupporters say that the current reliance on voluntary funding from member states and from charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation forces the WHO to focus on priorities set by the funders, and makes it less able to criticise members when things go wrong.\n\nAn independent panel on pandemics that was appointed to advise on the WHO reform had called for a much bigger increase in mandatory fees, to 75% of the core budget, deeming the current system \u201ca major risk to the integrity and independence\u201d of the WHO.\n\nLONG-STANDING SCEPTICISM\n\nThe WHO itself responded to a query by saying that \u201conly flexible and predictable funds can enable WHO to fully implement the priorities of the Member States\u201d.\n\nTop European Union donors, including Germany, back the plan, along with most African, South Asian, South American and Arab countries, three of the European officials said.\n\nThe proposal is to be discussed at the WHO\u2019s executive board meeting next week but the divisions mean no agreement is expected, three of the officials said.\n\nThe WHO confirmed there was currently no consensus among member states, and said talks were likely to continue until the annual meeting in May of the World Health Assembly, the agency\u2019s top decision-making body.\n\nEuropean donors in particular favour empowering, rather than weakening, multilateral organisations including the WHO.\n\nOne European official said the U.S. plan \u201ccauses scepticism among many countries\u201d, and said the creation of a new structure controlled by donors, rather than by the WHO, would weaken the agency\u2019s ability to combat future pandemics.\n\nWashington has been critical of the WHO for some time.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the WHO after accusing it of defending China\u2019s initial delays in sharing information when COVID-19 emerged there in 2019.\n\nThe Biden administration rejoined soon after taking office, but officials told Reuters they think the WHO needs significant reform, and raised concerns about its governance, structure and ability to confront rising threats, not least from China.\n\nOne of the European officials said other big countries, including Japan and Brazil, were also hesitant about the published WHO proposal.\n\nTwo of the European officials said China had not yet made its position clear, while a third official listed Beijing among the critics of the proposal.\n\nThe governments of Japan, China and Brazil had no immediate comment.",

          "text": "The boyfriend of slain cross-country traveler Gabby Petito admitted killing her in a notebook discovered near his body in a Florida swamp, the FBI announced Friday.\n\nIt was the first time authorities squarely pinned the blame for Petito\u2019s death on Brian Laundrie, though he was the prime suspect all along.\n\nInvestigators meanwhile announced that Laundrie, 23, had sent text messages to intentionally deceive people that Petito, 22, was still alive after he beat and strangled her in late August, according to a statement released by the FBI in Denver.\n\n\u201cAll logical investigative steps have been concluded in this case,\u201d FBI Denver Division Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider said in the statement. \u201cThe investigation did not identify any other individuals other than Brian Laundrie directly involved in the tragic death of Gabby Petito.\u201d\n\nPetito\u2019s body was found Sept. 19 at a campground near Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming. A coroner determined she\u2019d died about three weeks earlier of \u201cblunt-force injuries to the head and neck, with manual strangulation.\u201d\n\nLaundrie returned home to Florida in early September but went missing soon after. In October, his parents found an item belonging to him in a nature preserve near their house.\n\nFurther searching turned up Laundrie\u2019s remains, a revolver, backpack and the notebook. Medical examiners determined Laundrie died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nThe FBI did not specify what, exactly, Laundrie had written in the notebook and in the texts he\u2019d sent to mislead. The texts were sent between Laundrie\u2019s phone and Petito\u2019s phone, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThe timing and content of these messages are indicative of Mr. Laundrie attempting to deceive law enforcement by giving the impression that Ms. Petito was still alive,\u201d the statement said.\n\nGrand Teton was the last place the couple visited during a cross-country van trip last summer that ended with Laundrie mysteriously returning home alone in the vehicle. Laundrie and Petito grew up on Long Island, New York, but were living in Florida in recent years.\n\nThe couple documented their trip on Instagram. They crossed Colorado and on Aug. 12 were stopped by police near Moab, Utah, after the two got into a scuffle.\n\nPolice video showed Petito describing a fight that escalated. Police concluded Petito was the aggressor but officers decided to separate them for the night rather than file charges.\n\nAn independent report released last week faulted Utah police for not issuing a domestic violence citation to Petito after she told police she had hit Laundrie first. The report also pointed to indications Petito was likely a victim in their overall relationship and faulted investigators for not taking a statement from a 911 caller who reported seeing the couple outside their van and a man slapping a girl.\n\nThe ultimately tragic search for Petito drew worldwide attention, sparking social media sleuthing, discussions about dating violence and shining a light on the disproportionate coverage of missing white women in the U.S. compared to other missing persons.\n\nAttorneys for the Petito and Laundrie families did not immediately respond Friday to emails and text messages seeking comment about the FBI\u2019s conclusions.",

          "title": "Nigeria VP Osinbajo Warns Multilateral Banks against Defunding Gas Projects in Africa",
          "text": "Nigeria Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday warned multilateral finance institutions against defunding oil and gas projects in Africa, as the Western World continues its drive to phase out polluting fuels, saying such a step would have medium and long term consequences on African economies.\n\nOsinbajo, who delivered a special address (virtually) at the ongoing World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, added that drastic actions would ultimately impede the aim of phasing out fossil fuels.\n\nHe declared: \u201cWe need to ramp up energy access in response to this situation, which is why the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies must be just and fair. We are emphatic in our view that natural gas, which Africa has in abundance, must be accepted as a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we in Africa are working towards the globally accepted net-zero future, we are also conscious that our energy needs are increasing with the growth in our economies. We must not allow this worrying situation to be compounded further by global inaction, processes and rules that make it difficult for Africa to adapt to climate change or indeed to develop.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also urged the international community to meet its pledge that was recently re-affirmed at COP-26, of providing $100 billion annually in climate finance to support climate change efforts in developing countries.\n\nHe likewise called for a waiver on the intellectual property rights, to allow African countries produce COVID-19 vaccines to contain the spread of the virus and improve protection for Nigerians and Africans.\n\nThe vice president lamented that less than 10 per cent of African countries had vaccinated 40 per cent of their population.\n\nHe also warned that there would be a relatively slow rollout of vaccinations in Africa due to resource constraints, adding, \u201cYet, vaccinations remain essential because of the mutation of the virus and the emergence of variants that may be more dangerous than the Omicron.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo continued: \u201cThere are also the issues around African countries being able to produce their own vaccines. And that is entirely possible with cooperation, especially around intellectual property issues. We have to look at issues around patent rights, intellectual property rights, and exclusivity rights; especially if we\u2019re going to improve the chances of African countries to manufacture vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at relaxing those rights. Patent waivers and intellectual property waivers will be important. These are proved to be a problem now. No one seems to be making much progress in that respect. But we can\u2019t really talk about African countries producing their own vaccines if we don\u2019t address those important structural problems. I think that could very easily be done.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo stressed that despite giant strides recorded across Africa, \u201cthere are still challenges to overcome which requires international collaboration that can help to tackle climate change, address security concerns, promote economic prosperity, combat disease and improve governance.\u201d\n\nHe listed some of the progress on the African continent, including the recovery from the global pandemic, economic growth by 3.7% last year and a projected 3.8% growth in 2022.\n\nThe vice president noted: \u201cThere is now in place an African Continental Free Trade Area agreement to fast-track economic transformation just as the continent is making giant strides in agriculture, manufacturing and digital technology.\u201d\n\nHe added that in Nigeria for instance, 6 unicorns have emerged in the past six years.\n\nOsinbajo said it was time for the international community to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d by meeting its commitments towards advancing growth in developing economies, especially climate change obligations.\n\nOn the issue of peace and security, the vice president stressed that African countries face a serious threat of terrorism arising from the encroachment of global terror groups and their franchises into Africa.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIt is imperative for the international community to make more robust interventions to clear terrorists from Africa just as it did in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The United Nations Security Council must find unanimity in working with and assisting African countries to eradicate the menace of terrorism in the continent once and for all.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also called on the international community to support African countries to overcome fiscal challenges arising from their limited revenues.\n\nAccording to him, the creation of $650 billion in new Special Drawing Rights last year was a step in the right direction, \u201cbut more needs to be done to enable African and other developing countries access the SDRs that are not needed or being used by developed or emerging economies.\u201d\n\nHe further urged multilateral organisations to consider the huge obligations placed on African countries and adopt debt relief initiatives such as the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and the Common Framework for Debt Treatments in a manner that would not further constrain the resumption of growth to the continent.\n\nOn governance, Osinbajo called on the international community to support the efforts of West African leaders, under the auspices of ECOWAS, particularly their condemnation of the incidences of coup d\u2019\u00e9tats and unconstitutional changes in government in the region.\n\nThe vice president was one of the 12 guests that delivered Special Addresses at this year\u2019s event during which no fewer than 25 Heads of State and Government featured generally at the virtual forum since Monday.\n\nThe 2022 virtual edition of the forum features a mix of visionary \u201cstate of the world\u201d special addresses and ambitious high-level leadership panels focusing on critical collective challenges, among others.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
