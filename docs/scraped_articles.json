          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nThe push for booster shots when many Nigerians are yet to be vaccinated could undermine equitable access to COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria, virologists have warned.\n\nAccording to the virologists, rather than pushing for booster vaccination, the Nigerian nation should be stepping up campaigns to encourage millions of Nigerians, especially those who are yet to get their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to get vaccinated.\n\nThe call by the experts is coming at a time when data from the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control indicated that only 3.8 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s population have been fully vaccinated.\n\nIt is also coming on the heels of the emergence of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, which has become a big challenge to the quest to tame the viral pandemic globally and in Nigeria.\n\nRecall that on December 10, the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, in line with experts\u2019 recommendations, approved the administration of booster doses for persons that have completed two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or one dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccines.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, booster doses are administered to a vaccinated population that has completed a primary vaccination series (currently one or two doses of EUL COVID-19 vaccine depending on the product) when, with time, the immunity and clinical protection has fallen below a rate deemed sufficient in that population.\n\nIt added that the objective of a booster dose is to restore vaccine effectiveness from that deemed no longer sufficient.\n\nAlso and in line with WHO\u2019s recommendation, at least 40 per cent of eligible Nigerians should be vaccinated before the nation begins to push for COVID-19 booster shots.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Head of Department, Microbiology, Adeleke University, Osun State, Dr. Kolawole Oladipo warned that the administration of booster doses is going to widen the gap for vaccine inequity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, this is not the right time to be pushing the booster shot campaign in Nigeria considering the huge population requiring vaccination and the limited vaccine doses available.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is right because we have more population who are yet to get either the first or second dose, we need to get the population vaccinated before talking about the booster dose.\n\n\u201cCountries talking about the booster dose have gotten 50-70 per cent of their population vaccinated for the second shot.\n\nI think we need to get the first and second shot before talking about the booster,\u201d Dr. Kolawole said.\n\nAlso, a professor of virology at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Sunday Omilabu, urged the Federal Government to focus on ensuring that more Nigerians get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nThe don said getting booster shots does not make sense if other eligible Nigerians are not vaccinated against the viral infection.\n\n\u201cNigeria should try as much as possible to vaccinate a good proportion of the population before booster shots; at least, if we cover about 40 per cent of Nigerians of that vaccine age.\n\n\u201cSo, after the 40 per cent coverage, we can now be talking of whether to go for booster doses or not. If only about three million eligible Nigerians have only been fully vaccinated, will they go ahead and give the three million people booster vaccines? What about the remaining millions of eligible Nigerians?\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense as long as those other million are still in existence and yet to be vaccinated, they will make nonsense of the immunity that the three million have. We have to cover more people with vaccines before we start talking about booster doses,\u201d he said.\n\nOmilabu noted that the countries administering booster shots have vaccinated beyond 70 per cent of their population.\n\nSpeaking further, Kolawole, who is a medical virologist, however, noted that there is enough scientific evidence to justify the benefits of a booster dose.\n\nBooster shot, he said, \u201cAllows the development of much neutralising antibodies that will be capable of fighting the virus. Some studies conducted in other parts of the world have suggested that the booster dose is beneficial for people who have underlying health conditions. Both immunocompetent and immunocompromised will benefit from the booster dose,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Abdulmumin Murtala, Kano\n\nThe Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Nigeria, Abubakar Malami has spelt out reasons why president Muhammadu Buhari would not sign the new electoral law insisting that the law has not captured the interest of all Nigerians, has excessive cost implication, is discriminatory as well as supportive of insecurity.\n\nHe stated this in phone in program on Radio Kano while responding to questions on Sunday adding that signing it to law will only initiate a new crisis that will lead to court cases.\n\nREAD ALSO:TAJBank earns A2 short-term rating from DataPro\n\n\u201cWhat you should understand about leadership of the country most especially as it regards president Muhammadu Buhari on any law presented to him for signing, the president is entitled to certain rights. When you talk about politics he has rights, if you talk about economy the business community also have rights on him, if you are talking about 60% of Nigerians that are not politicians, if you talk about the economy he also has rights, if you are talking about security, there is also what is expected from him. The president has to consider laws that are sustainable.\n\n\u201cThe job of the president is that of politics, economy, business, security, legislations, politicians and non politicians. This is because the leadership of the country is not for the politicians alone, it is a leadership that affects social life of the people, their religion, economy, security and others. This is contrary to the leadership of the legislators which is solely political.\n\n\u201cTherefore the law makers are only concerned about their political inclination while the president is concerned about the entire lives of Nigerian made up of politicians and non politicians. Any bill signed into law by president Muhammadu Buhari is in the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of their inclinations. He is after satisfying the interest of the over 200 million Nigerians he is serving and not a particular sector\u201d the minister stated.\n\nHe further described the financial burden in the new electoral bill not signed by the president.\n\n\u201cFor example, one of the reasons is that there are 18 political parties and a law is founded that will allow for direct primaries. The difference between this and the general election is small because it allows for all Nigerians to come about and say their opinions.\n\n\u201cThis means that you will repeat the general elections 18 times. Today INEC requires N305 billion for the 2022 general elections. Now if the general election, which is not the newly proposed electoral system, will cost this much, how much will it cost to do the same election in the APC? It might cost at least N200 billion because it will involve everyone.\n\n\u201cAlthough the good side of the law is that INEC is required to monitor it.\n\nTherefore if it is assumed that every political party will will spend N200 billion, how much will then be spent in conducting the same primary election in 18 political parties just to produce a qualified candidate? Let\u2019s assume there are about 60 million politicians in the country, what about the remaining over 160 million Nigerians who have nothing to do with politics? Are you fair to them? All the people want are good projects, good road from Abuja to Kano, portable drinking water, good education, school feeding program and the rest of them. Are you fair to the 160 million Nigerians using their wealth just to conduct primary election to produce a party candidate, despite other demands by the public?\n\n\u201cMy answer to this is that, to spend this N305 billion that will be given to the INEC and the about N200 billion to be given to the political parties is not fair to the remaining 160 million Nigerians who have no business about politics and political appointments. Their business is just a better life in Nigeria. This is the issue of cost implications\u201d Malami said.",

          "text": "By Victor Ahiuma-Young\n\nORGANISED Labour, Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, and rights activists have asked Nigerians to revolt against the government\u2019s planned fuel price hike in the New Year, as it would worsen the poverty level in the country.\n\nThe group, operating under the aegis of The People\u2019s Alternative Political Movement, TPAP-M, made up of the Coalition on NGO Networks in Northern Nigeria, Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, TUC, Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees, Campaign for Transformative Governance, CFTG, representatives of Informal Sector Workers, Women formations, and youth and young persons, including those who continue to play front line roles in the #EndSARS movement, urged Nigerians to brace up for the battle ahead.\n\nREAD ALSO:Christmas: Reps\u2019 minority caucus not happy Nigerians can\u2019t afford basic needs of life\n\nAt a meeting on the \u201cdeteriorating state of the nation in general, the unacceptable evolving developments with regards to rising energy costs, and the impending unconscionable hikes in fuel price and electricity tariff being proposed by the anti-people regime currently superintending over the Nigerian state on behalf of the failed and ruining Ruling Class,\u201d they warned that the triple energy crisis, characterised by rising gas prices, had made gas unaffordable to the poor and even the middle classes, as well as the threatened hikes in fuel price and electricity tariff, which would price these essential products and services out of the reach of the impoverished masses and make energy completely unaffordable to the working people and the toiling masses.\n\nAccording to them, the combined implication of all of these is that Nigerians would be further impoverished. Businesses \u2013 in particular small and medium scale businesses \u2013 will struggle to survive; will lay off staff and even close up. Big businesses will also struggle with rising production costs, and those who can manage to stay afloat will do so at the expense of their workforce (many of whom will be laid off) and of ordinary citizens (to whom they will shift the cost).\n\nWhile dismissing the so-called subsidy and its planned removal in the New Year, the group in a communique by Omotoye Olorode and Jaye Gaskia (TPAP-M Secretariat), among others, said: \u201cWe reject in its totality the hike in the price of Gas, and the impending hikes in the price of fuel and electricity tariff. We insist that Nigerians cannot and must not be punished for the failures and incompetence of the ruling class and this regime in ensuring access to affordable energy and adequate security and protection.\n\n\u201cWe demand that past and present managements of the NNPC and the four moribund refineries should be indicted, prosecuted and brought to book for their crass incompetence that has resulted into the failure since 2012 to have to turn around the fortunes of the refineries and make them work at optimum capacity, thus contributing significantly to Nigeria\u2019s ability to acquire adequate domestic refining capacity.\n\n\u201cWe demand that all political office holders who have had responsibility for oversighting \u2013 in executive or legislative capacity, the petroleum sector should be investigated, indicted and prosecuted.\n\n\u201cWe demand the complete reversal of the power sector privatisation, and the re-nationalisation of the power sector, bringing it under the control and management of key stakeholders, including workers, and electricity consumers. We demand the recovery of all looted and misappropriated public funds pumped into the petroleum and power sectors (towards improving domestic refining capacity, increasing domestic production of LPG, or towards improving service delivery in the privatised power firms), etc.\n\n\u201cThe recovered funds should be utilised to build new public refineries, improve domestic LPG production, and improve service delivery in the renationalised power sector. We insist that any government that is unable to build public refineries and enable adequate domestic refining capacity for refined petroleum products should resign immediately.\n\n\u201cIn a similar vein, we call on all Nigerians to ensure that they reject any political party and their candidates who do not have any practical, fundable and believable program to resolve the energy crisis, and ensure adequate domestic refining capacity for refined petroleum products, adequate domestic production capacity for LPG, and improved services and coverage for electricity across the country.\u201d\n\nTowards this end, the Peoples\u2019 Alternative Political Movement (TPAP-M) shall reach out to other like-minded organisations, and link up with similar minded individuals to build a mass base for a massive popular resistance beginning in January 2022.\n\nTPAP-M and her allies will organise a week of mobilisations and awareness raising at the beginning of January 2022 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Occupy Nigeria \u2013 the January Uprising of 2012; and as well to build up momentum towards generalised mass protests across the country to resist the impending hikes in fuel price and electricity tariff, and the unfolding hike in the price of Gas. We demand a plan and a timeline to meet our demands. In view of the above, an expanded Coordinating Committee to wage the struggle against Hikes in Energy Prices would be established immediately.\u201d",

Governor Ikpeazu, as a leader who does not play with the welfare of Abians, particularly traders, will not spare anyone who fails to do his job in that regard\n\n\u201cThe biggest protection is to collectively protect ourselves.

          "text": "By Chris Njoku, Owerri, Okodili Ndidi and Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\nMy wife, daughter humiliated, says ex-governor\n\nImo govt: we have no hand in Police operation\n\nThe Imo State Government and the Senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday traded words over the arrest of the 2019 governorship candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) Chief Uche Nwosu.\n\nNwosu, who is also Okorocha\u2019s son-in-law, was arrested at St. Peter\u2019s Anglican Church, Eziama-Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area of the state by policemen in connection with \u201ca case that is under investigation.\u201d\n\nThe manner of his arrest had triggered rumours that he was kidnapped until the Police Command Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Michael Abattam, clarified that he was arrested, following an order from above.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was alleged that \u201cgunmen\u201d stormed the church during the outing service of Nwosu\u2019s mother, Jemamah Nwosu, and shot sporadically into the air.\n\nAssociates also alleged that the \u201cgunmen\u201d bundled the politician into the trunk of a waiting vehicle before speeding away..\n\nBut Okorocha, who said his wife, Nnenna, and daughter, Uloma Nwosu, were in the church when the operation took place, said Governor Hope Uzodimma \u201dis 100 per cent responsible\u201d for the arrest of Nwosu.\n\n\u201cHope Uzodimma deceived Abuja for the arrest of Uche Nwosu. Hope Uzodinma is 1,000 per cent responsible for the arrest. It is either Uzodinma is the IGP (Inspector-General of Police) or the governor of Imo State,\u201d he told reporters at his Owerri residence.\n\nThe former governor, who claimed that his son-in-law was \u201cdragged into a bus carrying Imo State Government number,\u201d said he did not know his whereabouts.\n\nHe also accused the operatives of humiliating his wife by pushing her down and his daughter by tearing her clothes.\n\nThe former governor, who described the incident as \u201cthe worst humiliation in my life,\u201d said President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cshould be informed about what is happening in Imo State.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cMy wife was pushed down and my daughter\u2019s clothes were torn into pieces by the policemen who came into the church to arrest Uche Nwosu with no warrant of arrest.\n\n\u201cI want to know the offence my son-in-law has committed that they rough handled him because I\u2019m yet to be informed. I have called the Inspector General of Police. His number was switched off. I have called the Commissioner of Police (Hussaini Rabiu). He said the order came from above.\n\n\u201cUche Nwosu, my wife and daughter were at the church for an outing service, when a group of men in police uniform while the sermon was ongoing, started shooting. In the course of their activities, they pushed down my wife and they tore my daughter\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cNo warrant of arrest. No invitation. We suspected kidnapping at first. Many people were injured while running. Uche Nwosu was dragged into a bus carrying Imo State Government plate number.\n\n\u201cThey were identified as policemen from Imo State Government House by their colleagues attached to Uche for the burial. I got the CP who said that IGP approved his arrest.\n\n\u201cThe shock of such arrest without warrant and humiliating members of my family are unfortunate. Most security operatives in Imo State know nothing about the arrest. I don\u2019t know what they framed up. The IGP could only do this on high-level misinformation from Hope Uzodinma.\n\n\u201cOver one hundred gunshots to arrest Uche Nwosu? What kind of ruthless behavior on innocent citizens of Nigeria?\n\n\u201cHope Uzodimma has shown tremendous heat to me and members of my family. Lawmakers who attended the burial were suspended. I am waiting to hear the offence of Uche Nwosu. Recall that Hope Uzodinma said he is going to name sponsors of insecurity in Imo state on January 3.\n\n\u201cI know he has nothing other than to cook up a story. Last time, he ordered my arrest and one security officer ordered me to enter the pick-up vehicle.\n\n\u201cUzodimma wants to frame me up by all means. Uzodinma has to answer for most of the activities going on. Uzodinma must mention the names of those who are responsible for insecurity in Imo State or he should be held responsible for all the killings in the state.\n\n\u201cUzodimma has framed up something against Uche Nwosu. Buhari should be informed about what is happening in Imo state. Hundreds of citizens are been killed in this state.\n\n\u201cHow come it is only Abuja and Imo State government House that know about the arrest. I want to know the reason for the attack on a church and, why Uche Nwosu should be treated like a criminal.\n\nImo State Government should provide answers immediately. You can\u2019t be governor of the people by intimidation\u201d\n\nImo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy Declan Emelumba said Okorocha\u2019s reaction has proved him guilty as \u201dall he wants to do is to whip up sentiments among Imo citizens.\u201d\n\nHe told reporters at the Government House, that the former governor should have waited for the law to take its course before reacting.\n\nEmelumba said: \u201cIf Uche Nwosu is arrested, what he (Okorocha) should do is to wait and see why he was arrested. But he is talking incoherently and that will not save him. What he should do is wait for the law to take its course.\n\n\u201cAll of you went to Orsu and saw the carnage there. I am not saying he is linked to the incident. You also witnessed his statement during his mother-in-law\u2019s burial where he invited youths to protest. All these are evidence of his inciting actions in the state.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner, who denied government\u2019s involvement in the arrest, said: \u201cThe government has no hand in the arrest of Uche Nwosu, but any attempt by Okorocha to use it to cause panic is evidence of guilt and that cannot save him.\n\n\u201cOkorocha contradicted himself when he said that the commissioner of police told him that the order came from the IGP and at the same time he said that the arrest was ordered by the governor. This shows that he is speaking incoherently and that cannot save him.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has condemned the police for arresting Nwosu inside in a church.\n\nIt urged the Police Service Commission (PSC) to investigate the arrest, which it described as an unprofessional conduct.\n\nHURIWA said: \u201dThe reckless and ruthlessly lawless mannerisms displayed by the Imo State Police Command in the vicinity of the church will make it impossible for citizens to separate terrorists from law enforcers because under democracy, the operatives of the law enforcement agencies are bound by rules of civility and law-based approach to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe method adopted by the police violates the Nigerian Police Act of 2020 in which several provisions mandate the police to treat citizens with dignity and to respect their constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights as enshrined in Chapter 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999 as amended.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this criminal tendency by the Imo State Police Command and this has given credence to the report documented by Amnesty International in which the global human rights body accused the command of the use of extrajudicial executions of innocent citizens as their law enforcement tactics. This sort of unprovoked violence and primitive show of force by the Imo State Police Command is unconstitutional, illegal, despicable, treacherous, and reprehensible.\n\n\u201cThis was why everyone in Nigeria believed that the shooters were kidnappers long before the police issued a tepid press statement claiming to have arrested Uche Nwosu.\u201d",

          "text": "By Gbenga Omokhunu and Blessing Olaifa\n\nGoods worth billions of Naira were destroyed in a fire outbreak that engulfed the Next Cash and Carry Supermarket building in the Jahi area of Abuja.\n\nAn eyewitness and one of the cashiers of the supermarket, Ogochukwu Aniekwe, told our correspondent that the goods destroyed by the inferno were worth billions of Naira.\n\nShe also disclosed that the fire started from an electric spark from a Christmas flower around 8:00 in the morning that later spread to other places.\n\nOther eyewitnesses said when the fire started, there was no fire service around for almost an hour as the fire service facilities in the shopping mall developed a fault.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAnother eyewitness, Joseph Ola lamented that the firefighters did not arrive at the scene on time.\n\nThe Coordinator, Abuja Municipal Management Council (AMMC), Umar Shuaibu said the fire incident was reported to the appropriate authority late, hence the escalation of the damage.\n\nShuaibu said: \u201cThe fire was reported to us late. We had to leave whatever we were doing to save the situation.\u201d\n\nBut the Director-General of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Abbas Garuba Idriss said: \u201cWe got the distress call around 9:00 in the morning and immediately we activated all the respondents who had been here on time, especially the security agencies to cordon off the place.\u201d\n\nIdriss, who could not ascertain the cause of the fire, officially debunked the rumour that there was looting during the fire incident.\n\n\u201cThe story of looting that you saw online is false. The people that you saw were the members of staff of NEXT cash and carry trying to move their goods from the inferno. This is normal, people are always eager to push fake news. Nothing has gone out of these premises.

It should be spontaneous. We would not play to the gallery. We are already down and they want to add to the problem. Nobody is going to run out of the country. We are all going to be here to see the consequences of what they are planning,\u201d he said.\n\nLawal said labour does not believe in the government\u2019s planned palliative of N5,000 to 40 million Nigerians to cushion the effect of the planned increase in price of petrol.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

The last one they did, they set up a palliative committee in which I was a member. Initially, what they told us was that there was N600 billion palliatives fund in the kitty which we are going to appropriate to different sectors of the economy to cushion the effect of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur own memo, that is TUC, was about 50 something pages, while NLC was higher. The two of us met to harmonise it. After our second meeting at Bolton Hotel in Abuja, I stopped going for the meeting because I was dumbfounded when the NNPC man said nobody promised anything. Till now, nothing has come out of it. They are just deceiving us with lies. They won\u2019t give anybody any N5,000.\u201d\n\nThe labour leader said measures ought to have been on ground and running for at least one year before the government could come up with this policy, so that the effect would not negatively affact citizens.\n\n\u201cBut here, we don\u2019t have anything like that. You see, it\u2019s a normal thing to subsidise things because it happens globally. But now they have removed almost everything. So at the end of the day almost 70 per cent of the resources of the state that should have gone to all these areas, they now appropriate it to themselves. With that, they have more than enough to share and that is why they are misbehaving and people are suffering.\u201d\n\nNLC at its meetings in Abuja penultimate Friday had scheduled a nationwide protest for January 27 and February 1, but with a clause that it would not wait till then should the announcement on fuel price hike come before the scheduled dates.\n\nThe NLC charged the government to promote local capacity to refine petroleum products for domestic use.",

          "title": "22 Nigerian Movers and Shakers in 2022",
          "text": "The new year, which will dawn in a few days, has been widely described as a defining moment for Nigeria. From the critical decisions that must be taken to accelerate economic activities, to the choice of candidates, particularly the presidential candidates, by the two leading political parties in coming elections, and the interventions by some private sector leaders, THISDAY, as part of its projections on what 2022 may hold in stock, presents personalities that may have significant impact on the political and business environments, and in turn, shape events in the country.\n\nThe 22 individuals, which have been carefully selected, and what qualify them as those most likely to shape the new year are detailed in this report. In their chosen endeavour, either in business, politics or entertainment, they have shown uncommon dexterity and perseverance in the face of adversity and doubt. The list is by no means exhaustive or definitive, but it represents a guide to a year that holds, in unknown proportions, promise, danger and possibilities that are bound to shape the future of the country one way or another.\n\nBuhari: A President Eager to Document His Achievements\n\nIn 2021, a normally reticent President Muhammadu Buhari, came out of his shell and was aggressive in his investment drive. Not even the threat still posed by COVID-19 could slow him down. This is expected to continue in 2022, as the president appears eager to document his achievements. Buhari is definitely among those that would shape events in the country in 2022. All eyes would be on him to see how he would deal with thorny issues in his final days, such as fuel subsidy removal, which is expected next year.\n\nIn the area of politics, Nigerians would also be watching to see the role Buhari would play in the choice of his successor. His body language towards the APC convention and other issues ahead of the next presidential election is closely watched. His support would be a critical factor in determining the direction of the party and the shape of the next general election. But with nothing really at stake for the president who is completing his second and final term, it remains to be seen if he would strongly back any aspirant.\n\nIn addition, Nigerians would be eager to see how the president would respond to the rising security challenges confronting the country.\n\nOsinbajo: No More Hiding Place\n\nWith the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, he is definitely going to be on the political radar next year. Osinbajo, even though he has not expressed interest in running for political office in 2023, comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but is more likely to keep his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much.\n\nHowever, in 2022, there will no longer be a hiding place for Osinbajo. All along it has been tales of people calling on him to run, even though there are allegations that his associates are the ones funding the various groups springing up to sell his candidature. Today, Osinbajo attends every ceremony \u2013 from birthdays and funerals, to wedding and chieftaincy coronations, among others \u2013 apparently to reinforce himself in the consciousness of Nigerians.\n\nIndeed, there have been different groups urging him to throw his hat in the ring. One of such groups is the Osinbajo Grassroots Organisation (OGO), which visited a former military Head of State, Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, recently. IBB, at the meeting, said Nigeria needed a leader like the vice president to run the country at this time. Babangida said Osinbajo was someone he respected because of his good intentions for the country.\n\nIn 2022, it would be interesting to watch Osinbajo go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to actualise a quietly nursed ambition.\n\nTinubu: To Finally Make His Position Known\n\nAfter playing a kind of hide and seek with the Nigerian public about his presidential ambition, there\u2019s a high possibility that in 2022, Bola Ahmed Tinubu may formally declare his position, whether or not he is gunning for the plum job. The former Lagos State governor is presently consulting with different interest groups and individuals ahead of the 2023 elections, with his eyes allegedly on the exalted seat. With SWAGA, the acronym for \u201cSouth-West Agenda for Asiwaju,\u201d a group populated by Tinubu\u2019s acolytes and yes men, touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature, it is expected that more of such groups would spring up in 2022 as Tinubu is said to continue to strategise ahead of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primaries. At the moment, he appears to be the front runner for the party\u2019s ticket in terms of preparation and war chest. And he is not lacking in supporters who are ready to sing his praises. But in equal measure, he is disliked by many for his vast e, unexplained wealth and his politics of godfatherism.\n\nEmefiele: Still Propagating His Made-in-Nigeria Dream\n\nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele, was, no doubt, one of the key personalities that shaped activities in the Nigerian economy this year. The stewardship of the advocate of domestic production at the apex bank is marked by unprecedented interventions in critical sectors of the economy with potential for high job creation. Efforts by the CBN governor to enhance credit flow to the private sector is particularly noteworthy, especially, in agriculture, through the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), which has revolutionised local rice production and created massive job opportunities for Nigerians. The CBN intervention in the power sector has also helped to stabilise the sector, which had almost been crippled by its legacy debts to the financial industry.\n\nEmefiele helped to broker a deal, which had since kept the ship sailing, despite all odds, and guaranteed improved electricity supply to homes and businesses. The apex bank under Emefiele played a crucial role in ensuring that the economy exited two consecutive recessions through its intervention programmes in key sectors as well as boosting government\u2019s spending to reflate the economy. In addition, this year, the central bank under Emefiele launched a Central Bank Digital Currency, the first in Africa, and the \u2018100 to 100\u2019 policy that focuses on job creation.\n\nGoing into 2022, the Emefiele-led CBN, in collaboration with the fiscal authority, would be critical in steering the economy towards accelerated growth.\n\nAtiku: A Recurring Political Decimal\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023 and this would likely be made fully open in 2022. Atiku\u2019s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023, even though he, too, is rumoured to have an ambition in 2023. Some people call him the serial presidential aspirant, but Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.\n\nSince his entry into politics in 1993, Atiku has unsuccessfully contested five times for the Office of President of Nigeria in the following order: 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. Will he be sixth time lucky if he gets the PDP presidential nomination? Will the forces in the PDP support and allow him to contest the primary? All these will unfold in 2022. No doubt, Atiku has enough experience and some see him as the most suited to wrest power from APC. Above all, he is a good tactician.\n\nWigwe: Access Bank\u2019s Aggressive Expansion Continues\n\nGroup Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Mr. Hebert Wigwe, who this year was involved in an aggressive expansion drive, is not likely to slow down in 2022. The bank is targeting expanding its footprints to 20 countries in Africa. From Nigeria to Rwanda, South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Zambia, among several others, Wigwe\u2019s expansion drive has remained on the rise. A few days ago, the bank opened a new branch in Rivers State, in its bid to serve more customers in the country. In Africa, Access Bank under Wigwe\u2019s leadership is positioning itself to tap from the opportunities in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nFrom a small bank in 2002, Wigwe, who took over from his close friend and business partner, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, in 2014, has completely transformed the bank, which then was ranked 65th among 89 banks operating in the country.\n\nDangote: Ready to Rescue Nigeria from Fuel Importation\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest man and President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, is among those expected to shape events next year. While products from his $2 billion granulated urea fertiliser plant hit the market this year, in 2022, his first private crude oil refinery is expected to commence operations in Nigeria. This refinery, expected to be a game changer for the country in 2022, would to be a major forex saver for the country. The Dangote Refinery is under construction in the outskirts of Lagos State, and when fully operational, the $7 billion investment would have the capacity to process about 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day, making it the largest single-train refinery in the world. The refinery would significantly impact on the Nigerian economy, and it expected to end importation of refined petroleum products.\n\nOtedola: A Critical Factor in First Bank\u2019s Future\n\nBillionaire businessman and philanthropist, Femi Otedola, became one of the personalities that shaped 2021, through his strategic investment in FBN Holdings. Presently, the billionaire is the single largest shareholder in the holding company with a total shareholding of 7.5 per cent and he is going to play a role in determining the future of First Bank, the leading subsidiary of FBN Holdings and an important bank in Nigeria.\n\nMarket analysts believe Otedola must have pumped a whopping N45 billion to attain the dominant position. But the Chairman of Geregu Energy Group has since debunked speculations that he is interested in holding a board position in FBN Holdings, First Bank or any of their subsidiaries.\n\nThis year, Otedola was also invited by the UK-based Save the Children to join the prestigious group of its Vice Presidents, in recognition of his philanthropic efforts to better the lives of thechildren in Nigeria. Save the Children is the second largest charity in the world, after UNICEF, and has Princess Anne as Patron since 2017, after serving as President since 1970.\n\nSaraki: Not Giving Up on North Central\u2019s Claim\n\nA former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, strongly believes the North-central geopolitical zone has paid its due by working very hard to keep Nigeria together as one united entity and should be given the chance to lead the country. He also thinks he is the perfect man to lead Nigeria, when the tenure of the present All Progressives Congress (APC) government ends. The former Kwara State governor has announced his intention to run for the office of the president in 2023. Going by his disposition, Saraki is not going to back down as he seeks the support of people of his region and other PDP leaders towards realising his presidential ambition. He is widely considered qualified, competent and boasting the requisite capacity for the job..\n\nElumelu: Relentlessly Supporting African Entrepreneurs\n\nFounder, Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Mr. Tony Elumelu, is expected to remain focused on building the next generation of entrepreneurs in Africa, which he says is his lifetime ambition. His goal is to impact lives and transform societies in Africa. Through his TEF Entrepreneurship Programme, a $100 million commitment to empower 10,000 African entrepreneurs, he intends to the continent better than he met them. Elumelu is driven by his philosophy of Africapitalism, through which he wants to see the private sector play its role in the economic development of the continent. In 2022, he is expected to continue to promote the development of young African entrepreneurs.\n\nAyu: A Leadership on Trial\n\nThe leadership skills of the new National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyiorcha Ayu, would be tested in 2022. How Ayu would be able to manage the different tendencies in the party and keep them together would determine if his name would be in the PDP hall of fame or infamy. He has started well by identifying APC\u2019s alleged failures and promising to rescue Nigeria from the ruling party. He has continued to remind Nigerians what he terms the good days under the PDP government and also how the APC has allegedly destroyed the country. Ayu has also cited the rising security challenge as one of the reasons the APC should not be allowed to lead the country beyond 2023. He has given himself a target of winning about 25 states in 2023, which sounds like a tall ambition. But the main task for him next year would be to manage the big egos in PDP, especially, some of the governors.\n\nAhmed: Driving the Nation\u2019s Economic Direction\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, will play a critical role in shaping the direction of the Nigerian economy in 2022. Nigeria recently launched a five-year National Development Plan (NDP), a replacement to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), which expired in December 2020. The country requires an investment size of N348.1 trillion to achieve the targets set out in the NDP from 2021 to 2025. The projected investment portfolio would be contributed by the government, which would source 14.3 per cent (N49.7 trillion) of the amount, while the balance of 85.7 per cent (N298.3 trillion) would come from the private sector.\n\nThe overall target of the plan is to achieve a broad-based real GDP growth rate of five per cent on the average during the period; generate 21 million full-time jobs; and through an inclusive growth, lift 35 million people out of poverty. The finance minister will be expected to drive the process of actualising some of the set goals in the plan before the end of the present administration.\n\nBuni: Live or Die\u2026APC in His Hands\n\nNational Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Committee of APC under the leadership of Hon. Mai Mala Buni, who is also the governor of Yobe State, must conduct the national convention for party as soon as possible. Presently, there are several power blocs in APC reportedly battling for the soul of the party ahead of the February 18, 2023 presidential election. Some aggrieved party leaders, believed to have an axe to grind with Buni, have been pushing for the convention to take place. Of course, the outcome of the national convention, which has been tentatively fixed for February next year, will determine the fate of the party. What this means, therefore, is that the fate of the ruling party is in the hands of Buni.\n\nDavido: Taking Philanthropy to Another Level\n\nDavid Adeleke, whose stage name is Davido, made news towards the end of 2021 following his N250 million donation to orphanages across the country during his birthday celebration. The award-winning singer has since set up a five-man committee to supervise the disbursement of the fund. Nigerians would be expecting to see how the committee would distribute the money. In addition, Nigerians would be looking forward to more releases by the award-winning musician in the new year.\n\nFayemi: Eyes on the Ball\n\nMany believe the Ekiti State governor and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, also has his eyes on the presidency. But he is said to be keeping his cards close to his chest because of the forthcoming governorship election in his state, which holds in June next year. For Fayemi, who would be completing his second term in the new year, the first battle next year would be to ensure that his party wins the governorship election. He has his eyes on the ball; yet, all eyes are on him.\n\nWike: One-man Political Squad\n\nArguably the most influential governor in the country today, by the time 2022 would be winding down, the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, will just be months away from completing an eventful eight-year tenure. Wike has largely determined the direction the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been going since it lost the general election of 2015. He saw to the exit of erstwhile National Chairman, Uche Secondus, earlier in the year.\n\nIn 2022, it is not likely PDP will want to take any step without Wike\u2019s input. He is one of those to watch in the new year. Even his opponents cannot deny that.\n\nWizkid: A Consistently Rising Star\n\nRecently, while performing during a live show, a fan grabbed the legs of Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid, and it took the intervention of security guards around the stage to rescue him. This young musician remains one of the most influential entertainment icons on the continent in 2021, and 2022 won\u2019t be different.\n\nThis year, he made history when he edged out Drake to win Mobo Awards. He also made history as the most awarded African act after winning the Best International Act and Best African Act awards. His \u201cEssence\u201d, which featured Justin Bieber and Tems, crossed genre lines to top Billboard\u2019s R&B, hip-hop, rhythmic and world charts. Coming up on the one-year anniversary of its release, it reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and became the first song with lyrics in Nigeria\u2019s Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 language to debut on the Global 200 chart, with 269 million on-demand global streams, according to MRC Data,\n\nIn 2019, producer P2J, a frequent collaborator of both Wizkid and Beyonc\u00e9, recruited the Nigerian superstar for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cBrown Skin Girl\u201d (also featuring young Blue Ivy Carter and SAINt JHN) from The Lion King: The Gift. Both songs yielded Grammy attention for Wizkid: a nomination for album of the year as part of Drake\u2019s Views and a win for best music video for the latter.\n\nThe year 2022 is not expected to be different for Wizkid.\n\nBurna Boy: Mummy\u2019s Boy, Music\u2019s Gem\n\nWith his mother as his indisputable role model, 2021 has been good to Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, commonly known as Burna Boy. He made remarkable progress as a musician this year and, no doubt, he lived up to his title of African Giant. He won the Best International Act Award this year and also his album, Twice as Tall, won a Grammy, the Best Global Music Album in 2021.\n\nHe is a Nigerian singer, rapper and songwriter. He is one of the biggest and most successful African artists. Burna Boy became the first African artiste to bag three nominations consecutively, having won the BET Award in 2019, 2020 and now in 2021.\n\nThe year 2022 will surely see the award-winning artist maintain his rising profile.\n\nTambuwal: Never Say Die\n\nOrdinarily, the security challenges faced by Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum should be enough to make his name fizzle out from the list of those to watch out for in 2022. But that won\u2019t be the case. Within his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he remains one of the most influential members and it is not a coincidence that his name keeps propping up as the likely presidential candidate of the PDP in 2023 should the party zone it to the North.\n\nA former Speaker of the House of Representatives, security challenges or not, he remains one of those to watch out for in 2022.\n\nMele Kyari: Leading the Transformation of the Oil and Gas\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, who is moving the corporation on a trajectory of achieving global excellence is one of those that would define the direction for Nigeria\u2019s economy in 2022. With the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) which has been described as a game-changer for the industry, the NNPC would be expected to drive the process of transforming the nation\u2019s petroleum industry into a hub of business opportunities. The Act is also expected to attract huge capital globally into the country\u2019s oil sector, strengthen cost recovery and ensure decent returns on investment.\n\nIt is also expected that Kyari, who has been in the forefront of transforming the oil and gas industry would ride on the new legislation to promote good governance in the oil and gas sector in tandem with the international best practices. However, one thorny issue that he would be confronted with this year is how he would manage issues around the proposed fuel subsidy removal. He has shown his clear disdain for its retention and preached repeatedly that subsidy is not benefiting the poor, which he insists, negates the purpose. In 2022 when the subsidy on petrol is expected to be removed, his negotiating skills will be tested like never before for the simple reason that Labour is recalcitrant about its opposition to subsidy removal\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji: The Power of Tech and Innovation\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji co-founded two successful fintech startups in Africa before launching Flutterwave in 2017. With $15.7 million in funding, the payments company is empowering Pan-African merchants to execute business on global scale, processing $1.2 billion in transactions so far. Aboyeji\u2019s previous startup Andela, gained attention when the venture received $24 million in funding from Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn 2021, Flutterwave started the year by securing a $170 million deal in the first quarter. New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global led the Series C round. New and existing investors who participated include DST Global, Early Capital Berrywood, Green Visor Capital, Greycroft Capital, Insight Partners, Salesforce Ventures, Tiger Management, Worldpay FIS and 9yards Capital. The Series C round came a year after Flutterwave had closed its $35 million Series B and $20 million Series A in 2018. The company helps businesses build customisable payments applications through its APIs.\n\nShola Akinlade: Expanding the Frontiers Beyond Africa\n\nAkinlade is the Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Paystack, a fintech company. The company provides modern online and offline payments services for users across the continent. It was founded in 2015 and was acquired by Stripe in 2020 for over $200 million in what was then described as one of the biggest exits in the African tech space. Paystack currently services more than 60,000 businesses and millions of individuals scored 27.5 for ingenious storytelling, 28.5 for brand tribe and 31 for brand experience thus ranking it at Number 8 with a total of 87 points. But despite the acquisition, Paystack has continued to operate independently. Stripe had estimated that the African internet economy was expanding quickly, with online commerce in the region growing at 21 per cent year-over-year, which was said to be 75 per cent faster than the global average. Akinlade believes that with the right tools, African creators, developers, and entrepreneurs would be able to do incredible things.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2018Our courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land. Let us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a special Christmas message personally signed and issued yesterday, promised to ensure that the security challenges facing Nigerians become history soon.\n\nFor years, terrorists have been roaming across the country unhindered, killing, kidnapping and maiming.\n\nWhile rejoicing with Nigerian Christians as they celebrate Christmas, the President declared: \u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\u201d\n\nThe President admitted that despite the \u201cremarkable successes generally recorded,\u201d the nation still has challenges to contend with.\n\nHe noted that the military was doing everything possible to tackle the insecurity menace.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time. It is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\u201d\n\nThe President urged Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in them and see the present order of things as a phase that would also pass, \u201cjust like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe said his government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, adding that the diversification of the economy embarked upon by his government was yielding fruits.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWe shall continue to create opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy. As we felicitate with family, friends, colleagues, associates, let us spare moments to reach out to the less privileged.\n\n\u201cLet us also pray and give words of encouragement to our gallant security personnel fulfilling their oaths to keep us safe.\n\n\u201cI assure my compatriots that this administration remains resolute at ensuring that the standard of living of the average Nigerian is elevated.\u201d\n\nHe assured that his six and half-year administration would fulfill all the promises made to Nigerians before the government terminates in 17 months\u2019 time.\n\nUrges Citizens to Get Vaccinated\n\nAlso in the Christmas message, the President pleaded with all citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that for the second Christmas running, the world would not be able to celebrate as it used to in years past because of the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic, with its attendant debilitating impact, has remained with mankind, mutating and leaving in its wake, devastating consequences on the economy, social interaction, and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining, however, is that humanity has been able to rise up with one voice and purpose, to confront the foisted conditions.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to appeal to our dear citizens to embrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic. Recent events have shown that vaccination greatly reduces the effects of the virus on the human body.\n\n\u201cI will also urge those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC). I commend the efforts of members of the PSC under the headship of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation as they continue to chart a roadmap out of the pandemic and associated issues.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I wish Nigerians Merry Christmas!\u201d\n\nKaigama: Heart of Every Nigerian Heavy with Suffering\n\nThe Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace, Most Revd. Ignatius Kaigama yesterday lamented that the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with the suffering they had experienced and seen in 2021 alone.\n\nKaigama, who stated this in his Christmas message, also called on Nigerians not to give up on the country, saying although the present situations may be tough, \u201cGod is in control.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with security challenges, COVID-19 and agitations for self-determination, Nigerians would not forget 2021 in a hurry.\n\nThe cleric told the faithful not to give up on their country, but \u201cdare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKaigama said: \u201cChristmas this year has found us in the throes of woes and distressing circumstances far beyond our human control. As Nigerians, in almost every part of this country, our hearts are heavy with the suffering we have experienced and seen this year alone \u2013 the many deaths as a result of terrorism, kidnapping and banditry, the depressing economic situation with inflation spiraling out of control, crashing further the ordinary man who has already been drained of joy, peace, and hope.\n\n\u201cThe violent agitations for self-determination, which have come with the loss of lives and limbs, have left horrific scars on our collective psyche. All these make this year one that many Nigerians may not forget in a hurry. Nevertheless, Christmas proclaims, \u2018Joy to the world the Lord has come.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor every disenchanted Nigerian who is on the verge of giving up on this country; for anyone who is prepared to cut off his moorings and drifts away to distant lands, Christmas challenges us to dare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that unbridled corruption and criminality were a grim reminder that selfishness had taken root in the hearts of many statesmen, the Archbishop said: \u201cChristmas is an invitation to give up selfishness, to think only of others and how to bring the greatest happiness to them.\n\n\u201cOn account of Christmas, all our leaders are challenged to once again dream big for our country and to faithfully work hard to realise those dreams so as to find solutions to our teething problems and better the lives of some of the poorest people on earth.\u201d\n\nCatholic Bishops Urge Nigerians to Be Hopeful\n\nCatholic Bishops have urged Nigerians overwhelmed by suffering and hardship not to give up hope of a better Nigeria.\n\nThe bishops said Nigerians should always remember the popular Christmas refrain, Emmanuel which is that \u201cGod is with us\u201d and try to be hopeful of a better future.\n\nIn its Christmas message issued by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) jointly signed by the President, Most Rev. Augustine Akubeze; Vice President, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji and Secretary, Most Rev. Camillus Umoh, the clergymen enjoined Nigerians not to allow any situation to lead them to despair because God is always there to intervene for them.\n\n\u201cThis feast reminds us that God is with us. Therefore, the word \u2018Emmanuel\u2019 should be a constant refrain in our mouths. We should, therefore, not allow any situation to lead us to despair because God is always with us. We are grateful to God for all his divine interventions in our lives. We know that if not for God, things would have been worse.\n\n\u201cI want us to use part of our time during this holy season and maybe even beyond the Christmas Season to develop our capacity to listen to God who speaks to us in silence,\u201d said the bishops.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ganduje demands deployment of more soldiers in Kano\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has described the multiple rocket attacks in Maiduguri by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) ahead of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno State last Thursday as worrisome.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba stated this while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa.\n\nThis is just as the federal government allayed the fears of Nigerians over the reported planned attack by terrorists on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nISWAP had launched multiple rockets on Maiduguri, the state capital, hours before the visit of the President to Borno State.\n\nFive people were killed and many houses destroyed by the ISWAP rockets that landed in different areas, including Ngomari, Bulumkutu, Ajilari, and Ayafe communities.\n\nThe IG, however, said the insurgents were unable to achieve their objectives.\n\n\u201cThey are launching it in major towns, they are launching it in Maiduguri. It is a concern. And it has been seriously checkmated. There are efforts to continuously checkmate it,\u201d Baba said.\n\nHe stressed that although the government and the security forces were particularly concerned about the rocket attacks, the target of the terrorists was defeated by security forces.\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari, during the meeting, tasked all security and intelligence chiefs in attendance to increase the heat against the terrorists and all other criminals, saying none should be spared.\n\nThe IG said they were asked to spare no terrorist or criminal, adding that the target now should be crime prevention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe marching orders are always the same; you have even told Nigerians the marching orders of the President. It has always been the same; there is no space, there is no tolerance to any threat to security.\n\n\u201cThere is no sparing of any terrorist and there must be an intelligence gathering, there must be proactive prevention of crime and there must be checkmating of all those that are involved in criminal activities, whether it is terrorism, banditry or armed robbery or whatever and that is what we are trying to do to the best of our knowledge and ability.\u201d\n\nOn why there are so many policemen deployed to the South-east region of the country, seemingly more than to areas considered more prone to violent crimes, Usman said population, economic activities and other factors determine deployment.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou said it is an allegation which has not been proven, it has always been an allegation. The spaces are different, the whole of the South-east, in terms of landmass, might not be as large as Niger State, so certainly you may see a number of policemen within a very small space, trying to do policing work and you may see another number, not equal, doing much more than that.\n\n\u201cBut when we talk about policing a population or policing a place where there is economic activity or policing in a place where there are more threats, then certainly you have to put more men to govern that small space and that is what you are seeing.\n\nAlso speaking to newsmen, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allayed fears among Nigerians, especially the residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, over reported planned attack on Abuja, saying there is no cause for worry.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any threat to the safety and security of Abuja. Abuja is secure and very safe. If there was a leak, as you mentioned, it could just be an operational alert that does not require any worry or concern. The Council has mandated us to assure Nigerians of their safety, of their security and enduring peace for the period of the festivities.\n\n\u201cThe message of the Security Council, through you to Nigerians, is that all measures for the safety and security of the Nigerian people and Nigeria, are in place for a successful and happy celebration of the yuletide and the New Year. Compliment of the season to all of us from the President and members of the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBefore the commencement of the security meeting, the President swore-in the newly-appointed Minister of State for Works and Housing, Muazu Sambo.\n\nIn attendance at the security meeting yesterday were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.).\n\nOthers include Minister of Defense, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.); Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; Chief of Defense Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo; and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nAlso present were the Inspector-General; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; and the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nGanduje Demands Deployment of more Soldiers\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more military personnel to forests in the state.\n\nSpeaking to journalists yesterday after meeting with the president in Abuja, Ganduje said he came to brief Buhari on the security situation in his state.\n\nHe called for the establishment of another military training base in the forest bordering Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi and Plateau, as part of efforts to check the activities of criminals.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThere are challenges all over the country that are unfortunate, but we believe Mr. President is doing his best with other stakeholders in order to curtail the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need the helping hand of almost everybody, especially governors and chairmen of local governments. We have observed that the security situation is worsening now. Our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, terrorists, armed robbers and criminals.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, we have taken some measures. We have two large forests, including the Falgore forest, which borders Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the army and there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest, using the facilities that we have provided.\n\n\u201cSo, that is helping to checkmate the activities of bandits in that forest and I have requested Mr. President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\u201d\n\nHe added that the state introduced the use of technology within its forests to improve effective communication between security operatives in the state.\n\nAccording to Ganduje, the state has also constituted an enlarged security committee to promote efforts to maintain peace.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have introduced technology within the forest. From the office of the DSS in Kano and the office of the commissioner of police and even from my office, we are able to monitor what is happening in that forest.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s effective communication between the DSS and the police and those who are managing the forest \u2014 the checkpoints and various places that security agencies are manning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re laying over 100 kilometres of optic fibre within the Kano metropolis, so that CCTV cameras will be more effective and we can manage the whole mega city in terms of security and also in terms of network improvement.\n\n\u201cWe have also constituted what we call an enlarged security committee because limiting it to the air force, army, police, DSS, civil defence, I think the security network, in terms of flow of information, requires much more than that.\n\n\u201cAlso, we introduced technology. As earlier mentioned, we have the most powerful tracker in the country. Through that one, even some people who escaped to Niger Republic, Cameroon, we were able to trace them and connect with international security agencies for their arrest.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Two more victims of the rogue police team at Force Criminal Investigation Department Annex, Alagbon Close, Lagos State, that forcibly extorted N22 million worth of bitcoin from two young real estate developers in July 2021, Morakinyo Tobiloba Peter and Yusuf Samson Dayo, have emerged.\n\nLed by Cordelia Nwawe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police with Force number 14534, the criminal team has been \u2018running riot\u2019 all across Lagos, seizing, framing and extorting innocent citizens they sense have access to good money.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters on Monday, two young men who identified themselves as Oluwaseun and Majeed narrated how the police team led by Nwawe forcibly extorted N32 million worth of bitcoin from them.\n\nThe duo said they were accosted on November 9, 2021 by the policemen around Mega Chicken in Ajah and taken to FCID Alagbon.\n\nSee Also Police REAVEALED: Identities Of Rogue Police Officers Who Extorted N22million Worth Of Bitcoin From Young Men At Gunpoint In Lagos\n\nDespite requesting to make a few phone calls to let their family members know the situation they were in, the policemen declined and instead seized their mobile phones.\n\nUpon getting to their office, they forced the young men to provide passwords to their phones which they went on to search for several hours in a bid to find any incriminating item on them.\n\n\u201cOn November 9, I and my friend were coming from Lagos, going back to school. When we got to Ajah, around Mega Chicken, we were stopped by some team of four guys and 2 policemen in uniform. They just double-crossed us all of a sudden. I didn\u2019t even know the four guys are police officers because they couldn\u2019t identify themselves. I told them to let me call my family that I have been kidnapped but the next thing I heard was that I should behave myself and shouldn\u2019t call anybody,\u201d one of them told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThey told the driver to keep driving until he saw a free space where he could park, so after the driver parked. They brought us out of the car and they said: who are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? So the next thing, they collected our identity cards, our phones. They couldn\u2019t collect my other phone because I hid it under the back seat cause I initially thought they were kidnappers or armed robbers.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Under Fire Policewoman, Colleagues Accused Of Extorting N22million Bitcoin From Young Men In Lagos Forced UK Returnee To Pay $30,000 Over Fictitious Petition\n\n\u201cSo from Ajah , they drove us down to Alagbon, Ikoyi where FCID station is. So on getting to the station, we were forced, threatened anden to unlock our phones. We were like why should we unlock our phones, the order has been made from above that no one should unlock their phone for anybody again. We said we are students, and also members of the Association of Hannset Hard and Software Repairers of Nigeria, Oyo State chapter and we presented our ID cards to them.\u201d\n\nThe duo added that they were beaten after making their statements and were forced to sign statements written by the officers, alleging that they were Internet fraudsters.\n\n\u201cAfter we made our statement, the next thing I heard was a slap on my face. I was shocked, like what did we do? What\u2019s our offence? The next thing they did was to bring out their handcuffs to cuff my friend. So they collected my own phone. They kept searching and searching. They searched everywhere and they didn\u2019t see anything incriminating. So they told me to keep logging in to my bank accounts, my emails and some other apps. I was like why.\n\n\u201cSo they asked my friend to open his phone too but he refused. So they tightened the handcuff to cut off his hand till he noticed blood wasn\u2019t running through his vein again. So my friend had to unlock his phone for them. So they went to his bitcoin wallet and saw a sum of N32 million worth of bitcoin. After they saw that, they removed the handcuff from his hand, and brought a white handkerchief to wipe off the blood running from his nose because he was totally brutalised.\n\n\u201cIn case I forget, on getting to the station at Alagbon, Ikoyi. They took us to one office, brought out a statement form asking us to write a statement about how everything went. We wrote as it happened but they slapped us and they tore it. Then we were forced and threatened to sign another one written for us stating that we were internet fraudsters.\n\n\u201cThen after that, they made a video recording of us saying that we were fraudsters.

          "text": "Two more victims of the rogue police team at Force Criminal Investigation Department Annex, Alagbon Close, Lagos State, that forcibly extorted N22 million worth of bitcoin from two young real estate developers in July 2021, Morakinyo Tobiloba Peter and Yusuf Samson Dayo, have emerged.\n\nLed by Cordelia Nwawe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police with Force number 14534, the criminal team has been \u2018running riot\u2019 all across Lagos, seizing, framing and extorting innocent citizens they sense have access to good money.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters on Monday, two young men who identified themselves as Oluwaseun and Majeed narrated how the police team led by Nwawe forcibly extorted N32 million worth of bitcoin from them.\n\nThe duo said they were accosted on November 9, 2021 by the policemen around Mega Chicken in Ajah and taken to FCID Alagbon.\n\nSee Also Police REAVEALED: Identities Of Rogue Police Officers Who Extorted N22million Worth Of Bitcoin From Young Men At Gunpoint In Lagos\n\nDespite requesting to make a few phone calls to let their family members know the situation they were in, the policemen declined and instead seized their mobile phones.\n\nUpon getting to their office, they forced the young men to provide passwords to their phones which they went on to search for several hours in a bid to find any incriminating item on them.\n\n\u201cOn November 9, I and my friend were coming from Lagos, going back to school. When we got to Ajah, around Mega Chicken, we were stopped by some team of four guys and 2 policemen in uniform. They just double-crossed us all of a sudden. I didn\u2019t even know the four guys are police officers because they couldn\u2019t identify themselves. I told them to let me call my family that I have been kidnapped but the next thing I heard was that I should behave myself and shouldn\u2019t call anybody,\u201d one of them told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThey told the driver to keep driving until he saw a free space where he could park, so after the driver parked. They brought us out of the car and they said: who are you? Where are you coming from? Where are you going to? So the next thing, they collected our identity cards, our phones. They couldn\u2019t collect my other phone because I hid it under the back seat cause I initially thought they were kidnappers or armed robbers.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Under Fire Policewoman, Colleagues Accused Of Extorting N22million Bitcoin From Young Men In Lagos Forced UK Returnee To Pay $30,000 Over Fictitious Petition\n\n\u201cSo from Ajah , they drove us down to Alagbon, Ikoyi where FCID station is. So on getting to the station, we were forced, threatened anden to unlock our phones. We were like why should we unlock our phones, the order has been made from above that no one should unlock their phone for anybody again. We said we are students, and also members of the Association of Hannset Hard and Software Repairers of Nigeria, Oyo State chapter and we presented our ID cards to them.\u201d\n\nThe duo added that they were beaten after making their statements and were forced to sign statements written by the officers, alleging that they were Internet fraudsters.\n\n\u201cAfter we made our statement, the next thing I heard was a slap on my face. I was shocked, like what did we do? What\u2019s our offence? The next thing they did was to bring out their handcuffs to cuff my friend. So they collected my own phone. They kept searching and searching. They searched everywhere and they didn\u2019t see anything incriminating. So they told me to keep logging in to my bank accounts, my emails and some other apps. I was like why.\n\n\u201cSo they asked my friend to open his phone too but he refused. So they tightened the handcuff to cut off his hand till he noticed blood wasn\u2019t running through his vein again. So my friend had to unlock his phone for them. So they went to his bitcoin wallet and saw a sum of N32 million worth of bitcoin. After they saw that, they removed the handcuff from his hand, and brought a white handkerchief to wipe off the blood running from his nose because he was totally brutalised.\n\n\u201cIn case I forget, on getting to the station at Alagbon, Ikoyi. They took us to one office, brought out a statement form asking us to write a statement about how everything went. We wrote as it happened but they slapped us and they tore it. Then we were forced and threatened to sign another one written for us stating that we were internet fraudsters.\n\n\u201cThen after that, they made a video recording of us saying that we were fraudsters. They then took all the money in my friend\u2019s wallet, about N32 million. They told us they would kill us if we didn\u2019t give them the money. They said they have killed so many people without their family members knowing.\u201d\n\nFollowing SaharaReporters story on how DSP Nwawe and her team forcefully extorted N22 milion worth of bitcoin from Peter and Dayo in July this year and the uproar that greeted that revelation, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, recently ordered an immediate investigation into the professional misconduct and abuse of office of the police team at Alagbon led by DSP Nwawe.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: How Under Fire Policewoman, Colleagues Accused Of Extorting N22million Bitcoin From Young Men In Lagos Forced UK Returnee To Pay $30,000 Over Fictitious Petition | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/piI8GzFIrZ pic.twitter.com/lZbGeX7uUp \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) December 22, 2021\n\nForce spokesperson, Frank Mba, in a statement said that a Special Investigation Panel led by DCP Olaolu Adegbite would carry out a discreet and transparent investigation into the allegation against the officers mentioned in the story by SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cDSP Cordelia and the other police personnel allegedly indicted in the report have been ordered to report to the Special Investigation Panel, Force Headquarters, Abuja, on Tuesday, 21st December, 2021 to answer to the allegations against them.\n\n\u201cThe Special Investigation Panel is headed by DCP Olaolu Adegbite of the Force Intelligence Bureau.\n\n\u201cThe Force advices any member of the public who has had similar experiences of high-handedness or extortion by the officers in question, her team or any other officer at the FCID Alagbon to come forward with detailed information to enable the panel achieve a holistic investigation,\u201d Mba said in the statement.",

          "text": "Many parts of the universe entered 2021 with the contentment that President Donald Trump, the American billionaire whose many crooked business deals also saw him to the White House, was leaving in 20 days.\n\nHis welcome departure, in reality, had no fundamental effect in American policies across the world. Joe Biden, who replaced him, only had a different style, but maintained virtually the same policies, including its partisan involvement in the unending wars in places like Yemen and Syria. In fact, in some cases, such as the unilateral imposition of bullish sanctions on countries like Cuba and Venezuela, Uncle Joe simply piled more.\n\nIn the cat-and-mouse game between America and China, the former under Trump, on January 13, banned all cotton and tomato products from China\u2019s Xinjiang region on the basis that they were produced through forced labour. The America-China 2021 Games are closing under Biden with his signing the Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act on Thursday, December 23 which reinforces the Trump ban.\n\nSome European countries began 2021 with lockdowns over the advent of the Alpha variant of COVID-19 and they are closing the year with another series owing to the appearance of another variant, Omicron. The hope of the World Health Organisation, WHO, is that humanity will rein in COVID-19 in the new year, 2022.\n\nOwei Lakemfa\n\nKim Jong Un of North Korea set his agenda for the year with his January 9 announcement that his country is developing new nuclear-powered weaponry. That country pursed its dreams with single-minded dedication through the year.\n\nNot a few Nigerians are in a hurry to see the back of 2021. In many respects, it has been nightmarish with inflation running at 16.91 per cent, the highest in contemporary times. The food inflation rate was 19.5 per-cent in September 2021.\n\nThe following month with the increases in the prices of gas, lubricants, non-durable household goods and transportation, inflation was 19.63, 19.33 and 19.07 per cent respectively in Bauchi , Gombe and Jigawa states.\n\nThe spin doctors of the administration do not like this reflection in the mirror and have sought to attack the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS statistics.\n\nIronically, under what was touted as the \u2018clueless\u2019 and non-performing Jonathan administration, the rate of inflation was mainly tucked at single digit. Given the uncertainty of the 2015 elections, it rose from 8.05 per cent in 2014 to 9.01 per cent the following year when the then retired General Muhammadu Buhari and his party stormed the stage with the battle cry of \u2018Change\u2019. With that, inflation shot past 15 per cent and on the average, has refused to climb down.\n\nThe \u2018Change\u2019 introduced by the new ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, came at very high costs both in economic and social terms and far more in human lives with bandits and kidnappers virtually overrunning the North West, especially Zamfara, Sokoto and the President\u2019s home state of Katsina.\n\nAlso affected are states in the North Central, especially Niger, Plateau and Benue states. For instance, in the first half of 2021, bandits and terrorists killed 3,295 persons in five states: Borno 920, Zamfara 765, Kaduna 648, Benue 504 and 458 in Niger. The Kaduna State Government said in the follow up quarter of July \u2013September, 343 persons were killed and 830 abducted.\n\nOne of the most disturbing reports came from Sokoto State which is not in the top five states with killing fields. Senator Ibrahim Gobir informed the Senate that on October 17, 2021 bandits at the Gorony Market massacred over 120 persons. He said in six villages in the area: Kwarangamba, Garki, Danadua, Katuna, Kurawa and Dama, the bandits imposed taxes of between N1 million to N20 million on the people.\n\nThe penalty for failing to pay the \u2018taxes\u2019 is death. Senator Gobir added that the bandits have imposed rulers on some of the communities. For instance, in Gangara, one of the towns run by the Turji Gang, the deputy gang leader, Dan Bakkolo has replaced the traditional ruler, while another bandit leader Dan Karami was installed the traditional ruler of Makwaruwa.\n\nThe year 2021 had begun with a spate of abductions mainly in the North West. The bandits concentrated on the mass abduction of students. On Wednesday, February 17, they kidnapped 42 persons, including students, staff and their families from the Government Science College, Kagara, Niger State. Nine days later, they abducted 317 school girls of the Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe, Zamfara State.\n\nA good development is that some of those who at the beginning of the year rationalised banditry, have begun to retreat. This is the case with Sheikh Ahmad Gumi who campaigned for amnesty for bandits on the basis that they are liberation fighters engaged in an \u201cethnic war\u201d and are \u201c\u2026 a population that is pushed by circumstances into criminality (but) are peaceful people.\u201d\n\nIn more serious countries, government would have resigned for its glaring failure to provide basic security for the people. But what we have in Nigeria is government agents and those under the table scrambling for crumbs, declaring that the Buhari government has done fantastically well in protecting Nigerians. Fortunately or unfortunately, the President\u2019s stay in the Presidential Villa, has an expiry date, but it is not in the new year; we still have 17 months to go. God Bless Nigeria. Amen.\n\nIt is understandable that many Nigerians have come to accept such killings, which include those of school children, as normal. However, the killing of a school boy in Lagos still sent shockwaves around the country. Perhaps it is due to the fact that 12-year-old, Sylvester Oromoni, was not abducted by bandits, tortured by those despicable fellows nor did he die in their hands. He was reportedly tortured by his fellow school mates.\n\nWhile many have expressed concern that events and activities leading to the death of the child could have taken place within a school premises, a thoughtless adult who masquerades as a journalist decided to add to the pains of the bereaved parents and our collective pain by claiming the late child invited death on to himself and had in fact voluntarily participated in killing himself! Incredible the extent hunger can push people.\n\nFirst, as a journalist and editor with many years standing, let me state that journalists are not irrational, unscrupulous and unfeeling beings who, like vultures, feed on carcass.\n\nSecondly, I apologise to the Nigerian public that it has taken so long for the journalists\u2019 professional body to expose this character and call her to order so she does not bring this noble profession into disrepute. There are two things that are factual about her: she is female and her mother was a woman, any other thing about her, needs fact checking. Happy 2022 to us all.",

It is also the first that has ever been approved for humans.\n\nNEW SICKLE CELL TREATMENT\n\nIn 2021, the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended a \u201crevolutionary\u201d drug for sickle cell treatment.\n\nAccording to the UK National Health Service (NHS), the treatment is the first of its kind developed in over 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new drug, known as Crizanlizumab, made by Novartis, is injected into the vein and can be taken alone or alongside standard treatment and regular blood transfusions.\n\nThe NHS said the drug will reduce the number of times a sickle cell patient needs to go to the accident and emergency unit by \u201ctwo fifths\u201d.\n\nFIRST SUCCESSFUL DOUBLE-ARM-AND-SHOULDER TRANSPLANT\n\nIn January, the world\u2019s first double-arm-and-shoulder transplant was performed in France.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe recipient was Felix Gretarsson of Iceland, who lost both arms in an electrical accident in 1998.\n\nAlthough doctors said it was uncertain how much mobility Gretarsson would recover following the operation, he has recorded some level of improvement throughout the year, documenting his progress on Instagram.\n\nHe can now flex his biceps and pick up objects. Experts expect he will make more advancement in the coming years.\n\nBLOOD TEST FOR EARLY CANCER DETECTION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe test is called the Galleri test, and it is a multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test that screens DNA for more than 50 types of cancer.\n\nIt studies the DNA to identify traces of cancer cells and it can then link the place of origin with high accuracy if a cancer signal is found.\n\nThe Galleri test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for cancer, such as those aged 50 or older. It is, however, intended to be used in addition to, and not to replace, other cancer screening processes.\n\nBLOOD TEST FOR DEPRESSION, BIPOLAR DISORDER\n\nIn April, a group of researchers at the Indiana University of School of Medicine in the United States developed a blood test that identifies mood disorders like depression and bipolar.\n\nThe study, which was published in the journal, Molecular Psychiatry, builds on previous research into the blood indicators that track suicidal tendencies as well as pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe study described the creation of a test composed of RNA (ribonucleic acid) biomarkers that can distinguish how severe depression is, the risk of developing severe depression in the future, and the risk of future bipolar disorder.\n\nThe research took place over four years with about 300 participants, primarily from a patient population at the Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center, using a four-step approach of discovery, prioritisation, validation, and testing.\n\nGAME CHANGER FOR BREAST CANCER\n\nIn June, scientists announced that they had made a breakthrough in the treatment of breast cancer by using a drug named \u2018Olaparib\u2019 after chemotherapy.\n\nAccording to the scientists, their study looked at the use of Olaparib at an early stage of the disease and indicated that using the drug on women following chemotherapy has a significant effect on reducing the risk of inherited breast cancer either returning or spreading.\n\nThe trial was conducted with a total of 1,836 patients for a year and results showed that there was a 42 percent overall drop in the risk of cancer returning in those who were given the drug.\n\nIt also also showed that after an average of 2.5 years of follow-up, 85.9 percent of patients were cancer-free.\n\nINJECTABLE TREATMENT FOR ADULTS WITH HIV\n\nOne major burden persons living with HIV go through is that of the oral antiretroviral pill that needs to be taken daily.\n\nIt was therefore welcome news when scientists developed a new HIV treatment using Cabotegravir (also called Vocabria and made by ViiV Healthcare) and Rilpivirine (also called Rekambys and made by Janssen), that can not only be injected, but will be required just every two months, after an initial oral (tablet) lead-in period.\n\nThe treatment is only suitable for those who have already achieved undetectable levels of virus in the blood while taking tablets.\n\nClinical trial results showed that Cabotegravir with Rilpivirine is as effective as oral antiretrovirals at keeping the viral load low.\n\nThe treatment was approved by UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in November.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s lastest loan to fund startups is a product of VP Osibajo Silicon Valley visit",
          "text": "Three years ago, during a roadshow that lasted three days, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Professor Yemi Osibajo visited San Francisco\u2019s Silicon Valley to meet with the executives of top tech companies, in order to attract investments to Nigeria\u2019s thriving tech space. The VP, with newly inaugurated members of his Advisory Group on Technology and Creativity, met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and LinkedIn co-founder Allen Blue before ending the trip at the entertainment centre of the world, Hollywood, where he met with representatives from Sony, Disney, 20th Century, and Imax.\n\nDuring talks in the roadshow, some investors hinted that even though they are willing to invest in Nigeria, they want the government to have some skin in the tech ecosystem game. When they got back from the trip, the office of the Vice President contacted the African Development Bank (AfDB) to support Nigeria with funding.\n\nThe dividends of these efforts did not materialise until this year when the AfDB approved a loan of $170 million to finance the Digital and Creative Enterprises Programme (i-DICE), an initiative by the federal government of Nigeria to promote digital and creative industries in the country. The programme is co-financed by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB)\n\n\u201cGovernments have a much greater role than just policy making. They need to be innovative and create an enabling environment that includes infrastructure and de-risking to harness private sector investments in key growth sectors,\u201d said African Development Bank President Akinwumi A. Adesina, speaking on AfDB\u2019s investment.\n\nThe i-DICE programme is a first-of-its-kind programme that intends to boost innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, enhance social development, boost innovation, and achieve economic transformation by fostering growth in the technology and creative ecosystem. From 2022 to 2026, the programme seeks to attract approximately US$695.80 million to finance various programmatic interventions (US$227.80m) and ground-breaking investment in businesses in the technology and creative sector (US$468m).\n\nThis investment will stimulate 226 technology and creative startups and provide non-financial benefits to 451 digital technology and small and medium enterprises. The programme is also expected to help reduce the country\u2019s growing unemployment rate by creating 6.1 million direct and indirect jobs. AfDB\u2019s recent investment alone will support the creation of about 850,000 jobs. It is estimated that the entire added value of the programme to the Nigerian economy would be $6.4 billion.\n\nThe programme will support the digital and creative space across four pillars: human capital, enabling environment, finance, and infrastructure. i-DICE will engage in skill development to equip Nigerians from ages 15 to 34 with technology and creative skills to increase their employability, foster innovation in both ecosystems, and widen the pool of entrepreneurs in the country. One of the ways it aims to do this is by upgrading the physical infrastructure of selected tertiary institutions\u2014universities and polytechnics\u2014to satellite labs and innovation centres of excellence and digital entrepreneurship (ICEDE); and online infrastructure\u2014by upgrading the selected online platform to host digital training content and other modules/features.\n\nIt will also support technology and creative enterprises by organising Hackathons, providing mentorship, launching a startup voucher programme that will support early-stage startups and entrepreneurs with access to workspace and hubs. It will also help these organisations cut cost by providing them with infrastructure like off-grid power solutions.\n\nThrough the Nigeria Entrepreneurship and Innovation Investment Fund, with an initial closing of $468 million, the programme will provide funding for early- and growth-stage businesses in the technology and creative industries in Nigeria. The Fund will invest in these businesses through three funding routes. It will do this by direct investments or debt financing of up to 85% in the Series A rounds of growth-stage startups and about 15-30% in the funding rounds of early-stage startups. Other ways it will also invest in these businesses is by subscribing to closed-end private funds as a Limited Partner of micro-venture capital firms and well-established venture capital firms and investing in listed private equity companies, funds, or other vehicles.\n\nNeed for a government-led fund for startups\n\nThe federal government discovered that while it has gotten relatively easier for Nigerian founders to raise money after series A, those in the early stage trying to raise some money to build an MVP or wanting to test their product and market find it much more difficult to raise money. So, the federal government is coming into the space to support investments in these early-stage startups.\n\nIn the process that led to the creation of this programme, a report Catalysing Growth through Innovation, funded by the UK\u2019s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), was published by the federal government to map out the innovation going on in the country.\n\nIfe Adebayo, Special Assistant to the Vice President on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, one of the brains behind the programme, explained that the government is involved in funding startups because it will help the ecosystem engage more confidently with investors, since the government is also actively involved in the ecosystem.\n\nThis is against the backdrop of the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSB), a bill that promises to create an enabling environment for Nigerian startups to thrive by resolving standing issues like the unfavourable regulatory environment, weak infrastructure, and lack of innovation incentives like tax breaks. The bill moved closer to being enacted into law when it was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) just last week. This programme hopes to ensure the localisation of the bill when it is passed into law, across all the states of the country. It will serve as a framework to test how effective the bill will be in the ecosystem.\n\nAnother important reason for the government\u2019s foray into the tech ecosystem is to invest outside the Lagos and Abuja bubble. The programme will be targeting states like Enugu and Kaduna where innovation activities are increasing, and some other parts of the country where it is at beginner level.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Venture funding in Senegal remains muted despite Wave\u2019s $200m buzz",
          "text": "Much of the global hype about and investment in startups operating in Africa over the past decade have been skewed towards English-speaking countries. The reality is reflected in annual reports on startup funding in the continent and 2021 has been no different.\n\nThis year, Africa has minted five unicorns, a term used to describe startups that have a market value equal to or over $1 billion. Flutterwave, Andela, OPay, Chipper Cash, and Wave joined Jumia, Interswitch, and Fawry in the exclusive club, bringing Africa\u2019s total unicorn count to eight.\n\nOf those that achieved the billion-dollar valuation in 2021, only Wave was built in a French-speaking country. In September, the Senegal-based mobile money provider raised $200 million from mostly American investors, in what was the biggest ever Series A round in Africa.\n\nAt the time, Wave\u2019s continental record raise was considered by some as a sign that Senegal\u2019s startup funding fortunes were beginning to change. However, the startup\u2019s success has so far proven to be the exception and not the rule, in the last three months of 2021.\n\nThe country reportedly has around 70 startups and, according to fundraising data compiled by Max Cuvellier and Maxime Bayen\u2019s The Big Deal, the ecosystem has raised only $22 million in 17 deals apart from Wave\u2019s Series A this year. Just one other Senegalese startup, Yobante Express, raised over $1 million.\n\nSenegal\u2019s low levels of startup investing activity, compared to countries like Nigeria or South Africa, is a stark representation of a long-standing funding gap that exists between the anglophone and francophone West Africa regions.\n\nGenerally, economies in the latter are much less developed than those in English-speaking regions when it comes to tech. While Nigeria has abundant incubators and accelerators, the scale obtainable in Senegal, Cameroon, or C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2014home to French-speaking West Africa\u2019s most promising tech ecosystems\u2014is much smaller.\n\nHence venture capital investors have historically drifted towards the region\u2019s more developed tech hubs. This year, African startups have raised more than $4 billion in funding, so far. Nigeria alone accounts for 35% of this funding and, along with Ghana, took the lion\u2019s share, some 86%, of funding that flowed into West African startups. French-speaking Senegal (13%), Cameroon (0.7%), and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (0.3%) make up the rest of the startup funding share, according to available data.\n\nThe significantly strict regulatory landscape in francophone Africa is often cited as a major factor that\u2019s contributed to a venture funding apathy held by foreign investors, who prefer to invest in anglophone markets.\n\n\u201cFrancophone Africa inherited the French system\u2019s bureaucracy, heavy administration, and governance style; as such, processes and regulations can be stricter than in other regions,\u201d Coura Sene, Wave\u2019s General Manager for the eight French-speaking countries in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), told TechCabal in this interview.\n\nShe adds that with English being the \u201cde facto language in technology and the digital era, it\u2019s more natural for investors to focus on Anglophone markets\u201d such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOwing to the conservative nature of regulators in the region, Wave itself opted to partner with local commercial banks to launch its mobile money service rather than obtain an independent license from the get-go, just to make authorities \u201cmore comfortable\u201d with its solution. As the startup expands into other countries like C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Togo, and Benin Republic, however, it intends to get an independent mobile money license.\n\nTo Ashley Gauzere, founder of HUB2, a C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire-based startup that provides digital infrastructure solutions for banking and insurance providers, another problem is the penetration of technology-enabled products in Africa\u2019s French-speaking countries, which is significantly low compared to their anglophone counterparts.\n\nHUB2\u2019s services are available in nine (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mali, Guinea, Togo, Benin, and Gabon) of 14 countries in the CIMA zone, a central supervisory authority established in 1992, overseeing insurance in French-speaking, sub-Saharan African countries.\n\nDespite the drawbacks and yet another subdued startup funding performance this year (apart from Wave\u2019s raise), Cynthia Mandjek, investment manager at France-based, Africa-focused VC firm Saviu Ventures, thinks investors are waking up to opportunities in francophone Africa, which is \u201clong overdue\u201d for disruption.\n\nSene shares this sentiment and is bullish on the region\u2019s potentials, pointing to its homogeneity in currency (the CFA franc) and language as an attraction. \u201cIf you take the region as a whole, which shares the same currency and language, you start to appreciate the total size of the market. The opportunities it presents outweigh any perceived challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the differences in each country, once your product gains ground in more than one country, I believe this becomes a significant competitive advantage,\u201d Moulaye Tabour\u00e9, founder of Ivorian fashion retail startup Afrikrea noted in an interview with Rest of World. \u201cNetwork effects started in the zone are more resilient and cheaper to sustain than from Nigeria to Kenya, for example.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, the notably growing startup ecosystem in Senegal\u2014Wave\u2019s home country where Sene says there\u2019s \u201cmore appetite\u201d for digitisation\u2014is well-positioned to play an anchor role in attracting global attention, and potential VC investments, into the francophone region.\n\n\u201cIt might not be the largest by gross domestic product compared to the much larger Ivorian economy, but there\u2019s definitely more appetite for digital products,\u201d the Wave GM said.\n\nIn addition to the appetite, Senegal is home to a large number of startups (though most are still in their infancy), co-working spaces, incubators, and accelerators, as well as local investment funds such as Partech and Orange Digital Ventures. However, instead of equity, the majority of funding available in the market are grants and concessional loans.\n\nThat should change as the country\u2019s tech sector grows and attracts more non-francophone Africa investors, according to stakeholders, who believe it might be too soon to start gauging the impact of Wave\u2019s funding success on the broader regional tech ecosystem.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Flutterwave x Wizkid to drive global payments adoption",
          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We should extend a hand of fellowship, extend happiness to those who are not fortunate as us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why we are going round to do as much as we can to physically visit orphanages and people who have challenges, at this time of the year.

In the spirit of the Yuletide, they deserve to have a feel of it just like every other child\u201d.\n\nSpeaking further, Mr. Otueroro said \u201cWe are doing this to promote inclusiveness because every child matters and deserves equal right to access the world irrespective of their birth conditions\u201d.\n\nHe also called for more supports for people with disabilities \u201d I want to use this opportunity to solicit more supports from the public and stakeholders for children with special needs because really these people, their families and caregivers need the supports to alleviate the suffering they go through\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman of the occasion, Mr. Kingsley Oromonsele hailed the foundation for putting smiles on the faces of the physically challenged in the state. According to him \u201d every 24th of December, we look forward to this party. This is because for the past nine years, this foundation has not failed to lavish Christmas party on children with disabilities. COF has indeed demonstrated love for special children and I wish to thank the Foundation on behalf of many children with special needs here today\u201d\n\nMr. Oromonsele however called on Edo Government to urgently domesticate the Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities (Prohibition) Acts 2018 which was passed by Federal Government in 2019 to protect the physically challenged persons in the state.\n\n\u201cWe see Edo state government as our father and Disability Act as our last hope. Currently the discrimination physically challenged persons face is too much; in education, health, employment and even housing, they are too many to mention. But much of these challenges have been addressed in the Act that once domesticated in Edo State, will bring relief to us\u201d.\n\nAlso, the matron of COF and a former Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues in Edo State, Hon. Mrs. Florence Gbinigie appealed to Edo Government to allocate more funding to the ministry because according to her \u201cit is the ministry that takes care of people with special needs in the state\u201d.\n\n...",

          "text": "Artisans and roadside workers earning their daily incomes in and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have cried out to authorities of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), especially the management of Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) over alleged and incessant extortion by some personnel of the board raiding their business premises.\n\nThe artisans claimed the AEPB officials often extorted money from them for allegedly flouting FCT sanitation laws.\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint, the artisans called government\u2019s attention to activities of the AEPB officials who moved around in their numbers daily in a patrol van.\n\nThe artisans said they (AEPB) would order them to part with some money for using their business premises, failure of which their tools would be impounded and taken to the Area 3 Garki office of the agency where they would be made to pay fines without receipts before release.\n\nSpeaking to one of Blueprint reporters in tears, a roadside vulcanizer at Wuye, Kazeem Oyinlola, said his experience with AEPB has not been palatable.\n\n\u201cI have always been their victim anytime they come here. There was a time they came to Wuye here and carried my machine in my absence. That day, after I resumed work, I had to rush back to Karmo hospital because my wife was on admission there. When I was told that AEPB people came and carried my machine, I quickly returned and went to their office at Area 3. There, they told me to pay N10, 000 or face a mobile court. After much plea, it was reduced to N5, 000. That day, I had nothing on me because I hadn\u2019t worked before I rushed to Karmo. It was our union chairman that assisted me with the amount before my machine was released. To my surprise, there was no receipt. When I asked, they warned me never to ask them for any receipt.\n\n\u201cAs if that was not enough, they have been coming here almost thrice in a week. Anytime they come in their truck, they would beckon on us and demand that we give them some money. If anyone says no, they would come down from their truck and confiscate the tools; so any time they come, even if we don\u2019t have money, we would run round to borrow and give them before they would go. They don\u2019t even care whether we have worked that day or not.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I am tired of AEPB. I don\u2019t want to steal; this is the only thing I can do to feed myself, wife and a daughter. They are driving me into crime if this continues. So far, I can say that since this year, I have spent almost N50, 000 to these people. Where do they want us to go? Are we not part of the society again?\u201d he asked in anger.\n\nCorroborating Oyinlola\u2019s position is Mr Victor Nwabanike, who specialises in tyre alignment within the same premises.\n\nHe said: \u201cAEPB has taken my tools away many times especially as the Christmas approaches. Whenever that happens, we would follow their vehicle to somewhere nearby where they would ask us to pay some money after which they would release the tools without any receipt. Even yesterday, they came around and parked my tools again. I quickly mobilised some money for them before they left. That is the challenge we face here. I don\u2019t litter the environment here and I am not close to the road, so I don\u2019t know why they chose to be doing this to us here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nwabanike, \u201cinstead of this money we pay these people without receipt, government should create a layout clearly marked out for rent by artisans whereby the government can generate income instead of this regular extortion without any receipt.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the development, Chairman of Artisans and Roadside Auto Mechanic in Wuye, Mr Adeniyi Owolabi, said the association comprises mechanics, vulcanizers, car wash operators, food vendors, and herbal medicine sellers (agbo).\n\nHe said though mechanics have never been extorted by AEPB personnel, others like vulcanizers, car wash operators, food and herbal medicine sellers have complained about alleged extortion by AEPB.\n\n\u201cThey do come to our area here to carry vulcanizers\u2019 tools and car wash as well as those who do car alignment. They will pack their tools to their office because they couldn\u2019t offer the taskforce anything. Most times, I bail them out myself without any receipt. Here, we are not criminals; we come here to work and help ourselves. In fact, our presence here has prevented criminals from entering the estate. Before now, from this place to the foot of the hill, it was complete bush. However, our presence has prevented criminals from entering the estate.\n\n\u201cLet AEPB stop harassing our members so that they can do legitimate work to help themselves and those they render services to.\u201d\n\nSimilar views were expressed by some artisans in Jahi, Kado Estate, Gwarimpa, Kubwa and a couple of other areas.\n\n\u201cIt is terrible that we could be treated this way by the AEPB people as Nigerians. Are they saying we are not entitled to living in and around Abuja? They should not drive us into crimes. Survival has been very tough for every Nigerian, artisan inclusive. We are using our hands to earn legitimate livelihood, yet we are being persecuted. Let government look into it and save our lives and by extension the nation from further security woes. Nigeria can\u2019t afford another security challenge,\u201d said Sunday Yusuf, an artisan in Kubwa.\n\nSecurity implication\n\nSpeaking on the security implication of this raid on the artisans, a retired police officer and CEO of Crime Guard, Mr Teidi Ameh, said it portends a dangerous signal for the already-tensed security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cLet official policies allow sleeping dogs to lie. Apart from the services those categories of people offer, when a large pool of such people that are already used to handling hard metals are exposed to crimes, residents of cities and estates would find it difficult to stay peacefully. I have personally noticed the misbehaviour of some of those boys in AEPB trucks; unfortunately, some of them also exhibit criminal tendencies such that one wonders how they got that job. But their activities should be moderated so that it doesn\u2019t exacerbate the current security situation.\u201d\n\nAllegations false \u2013 AEPB\n\nBut the management of AEPB has denied the alleged extortion by its personnel, describing it as baseless, mere insinuations and fake news targeted at ruining AEPB\u2019s reputation.\n\n\n\nAEPB Deputy Director Information and Public Relations Mrs Janet Peni made the agency\u2019s position known in an interview with Blueprint. She said officials of the board were concerned with maintaining sanity in the city and would not compromise, noting that linking AEPB to AMAC officials was wrong.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe present AEPB under the watch of Kaka Ali has taken additional steps to consolidate on the successes it had recorded and would not limit the standards.\n\n\n\n\u201cAbuja Environmental Protection Board is different from Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and their activities don\u2019t concern us, we must not forget that AMAC is a local government situated in the Federal Capital City.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are keen on our roles in ensuring sanity in the Federal Capital Territory and we would be happy if those claiming that our men harass come to our office with evidence.\n\n\n\n\u201cAEPB doesn\u2019t compromise; anyone found guilty would face the full wrath of the administration.\u201d",
          "summary": "The artisans claimed the AEPB officials often extorted money from them for allegedly flouting FCT sanitation laws.\nIn a chat with Blueprint, the artisans called government\u2019s attention to activities of the AEPB officials who moved around in their numbers daily in a patrol van.\nWhen I was told that AEPB people came and carried my machine, I quickly returned and went to their office at Area 3.\nAEPB Deputy Director Information and Public Relations Mrs Janet Peni made the agency\u2019s position known in an interview with Blueprint.\nShe said officials of the board were concerned with maintaining sanity in the city and would not compromise, noting that linking AEPB to AMAC officials was wrong.",

The Federal Fire Service has turned out fire fighters to the scene, who are currently fighting the fire.\n\n\u201cThe Public are to take note and avoid that route\u201d, she said in a text message to one of our correspondents.\u201d\n\nAlso, Director, Forecasting Response Mitigation in the FCT Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, Mrs Florence Wenegieme, said the agency received a distress call around 9:45am and a team was immediately dispatched to the location.\n\nShe said as at the time of the report, there was no casualty.\n\nOn her part, spokesman of the agency, Nkechi Isa, said upon receiving the distress call, FERMA \u201cimmediately activated all responders, including the Federal Fire Service, FCT Fire Service, FCT police Command, Department of State Services, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, National Emergency Management Agency and the armed forces.\n\n\u201cOthers were Julius Berger, NNPC, and other private corporate entities in the Federal Capital City FCC.\u201d\n\nShe quoted Director General FEMA Alhaji Abbas Idriss as dismissing reports of looting at the premises.\n\n\u201cImmediately the agency got to the scene of the incident, the security cordoned the area and fire fighting began. There was no looting whatsoever as being speculated by some people in the Social Media.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw on social media was staff of Next Cash n Carry trying to salvage the goods using trolleys. Nothing was taken out of the premises,\u201d she further quoted Idriss as saying.\n\nIdriss also said investigations were ongoing to ascertain the immediate cause of the fire.\n\nHe further said no life was lost to the incident neither was anyone within the premises injured.\n\nThe FERMA boss appealed to business owners in the territory to factor in the risk element in their business plans, noting that fire trucks were hampered by limited access within the shopping mall.\n\nLooting spree\n\nNotwithstanding FERMA\u2019s position that there was no looting, Blueprint gathered via a 30-second video clip seen by our reporter that it was a looting spree for some people.\n\nThe video showed looters running in and out of the burning supermarket.\n\nItems such as bottled water, packets of minerals, mattresses, plasma tv, and computer sets were being carried away by the looters.\n\nIn the same video, a female looter was seen telling others coming out of the supermarket with items they were carting away from the supermarket, \u201cuna well done o,\u201d as she made her way into the supermarket.\n\nAlso, one of the looters could be heard telling another one in Igbo language; \u201chold the item in your hand very well ooh.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Blueprint saw some under aged as well as adults who were obviously not the company workers, struggling to cart away some items while efforts were on to put out the fire.",

We have carefully implemented this where the Batch C1 accommodates a total of 510,000 beneficiaries and the batch C2 will commence soon. This is to enlist more Nigerian youths into the programme.\n\n\u201cIt is a well-known fact that N-Power programme is a critical part of the National Social Investment Programmes domiciled in the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development (FMHADMSD) and designed to achieve the National objectives of poverty reduction and job creation.

N-Knowledge programme targets to upskill 20,000 young Nigerians on the global radar as exporters of world- class services and content in the creative and information technology sectors. The shortfall of about 7,000 will be mopped up as soon as possible to meet up with the target of 20,000 as earmarked for this tranche.\n\n\u201cThis training component is targeted at developing competencies of the youth in software development, hardware training and creative industry which is catalytic as well as the groundwork to make Nigeria compete in the outsourcing market for software development.\n\n\u201cIt will develop the skills and capacities along the skills set in the value chain of website development, mobile apps maintenance and start the talent development effort for the growth of information technology industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShe added that, \u201cThe Ministry is committed to ensuring that the strategic objectives of all the social intervention programmes are achieved and sustained.\n\n\u201cPermit me at this juncture to thank His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari for his administration\u2019s unwavering efforts in eradicating poverty in our country and for supporting and sustaining the National Social Investment Programmes.\u201d",

          "text": "There is nothing abnormal in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s aides testing positive for COVID-19 because they are humans, the Presidency has said.\n\nMr Femi Adesina, who is the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, stated this during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\n\u201cWhat I like to say is that presidential aides are humans,\u201d he said in his response to a question about reports of the COVID-19 virus ravaging the Presidential Villa. \u201cThey can fall sick, they can contract the virus, and the virus can also disappear.\n\n\u201cPresidential aides are just humans; if anything happens to human beings, it can also happen to presidential aides. The fact that we are presidential aides does not make us immune to certain things. If there is a virus that is ravaging society, well, it can touch anybody.\u201d\n\n\u2018No Cause For Alarm\u2019\n\nReports had emerged that some of President Buhari\u2019s aides have gone into isolation after they tested positive for COVID-19. However, the number of those infected could not be ascertained.\n\nOver the weekend, the President\u2019s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, confirmed to Channels Television that he was infected with the virus.\n\nDespite being fully vaccinated, he disclosed that he had mild symptoms of the disease \u2013 a trait connected with the omicron variant, saying he has since gone into isolation and would go for further tests to ascertain his status.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari\u2019s Spokesman, Garba Shehu Tests Positive For COVID-19\n\nAdesina, on his part, could not ascertain the actual number of presidential aides infected with the virus, although he affirmed Shehu\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cThat will not be within my purview to discuss, maybe if you get the presidential doctor or anybody on the medical side, they will tell you, I wouldn\u2019t know because it is a private thing.\n\n\u201cIf it happens to anybody, it\u2019s between that person and possibly the doctor. It is not going to be general knowledge. So, I may not be able to say,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo Mallam Garba Shehu has confirmed that, yes, he tested positive but he said it\u2019s mild. And I believe that by now \u2013 because it happened since Wednesday \u2013 he should almost have beaten it if he has not beat it already. There is no cause for alarm.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s spokesman also stated that the development in the villa has not in any way disrupted the President\u2019s schedule and routine, as aides who test positive were required to stay away until they have recovered from the disease.\n\n\u201cWell, I think Mr. President is quite fine, he is doing his normal routine, following his normal schedule. But if anybody close to him tests positive, that person is required to stay away till he tests again, and he tests negative. Mr President just follows his normal schedule and routine,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "South African anti-apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu, described as the country\u2019s moral compass, died on Sunday aged 90, sparking an outpouring of tributes for the outspoken Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nThe small-statured Tutu, who had largely faded from public life in recent years, was remembered for his easy humour and characteristic smile \u2014 and above all his tireless fight against injustices of all colours.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa honoured this fight in a tribute to Tutu, announcing the archbishop\u2019s death on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation\u2019s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDesmond Tutu was a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world.\u201d\n\nMourners gathered outside his former parish in Cape Town, St George\u2019s Cathedral, while others massed at his home, some holding flower bouquets, according to an AFP journalist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very very sad he died. He was such a good man,\u201d said retired accountant Diane Heard.\n\nThe South African cricket team wore black armbands in his honour of the first day of the first Test against India in South Africa.\n\nKenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said, \u201cTutu inspired a generation of African leaders who embraced his non-violent approaches in the liberation struggle\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: South African Court Says Zuma Can Appeal Return To Jail\n\n\u2018Rainbow Nation\u2019\n\nA tireless activist, Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for combatting white minority rule in his country.\n\nFamously outspoken, even after the fall of the racist apartheid regime, Tutu never shied away from confronting South Africa\u2019s shortcomings or injustices.\n\nIt was Tutu who coined and popularised the term \u201cRainbow Nation\u201d to describe South Africa when Nelson Mandela became the country\u2019s first black president.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Tutu slammed even the ruling African National Congress (ANC) \u2014 the vanguard of the fight against white-minority rule \u2014 for cronyism and nepotism after apartheid ended in 1994.\n\nIn the past, he has confronted homophobia in the Anglican Church, challenged Mandela over-generous salaries for cabinet ministers and stridently criticised the corruption that mushroomed under ex-president Jacob Zuma.\n\nOrdained at the age of 30 and appointed archbishop in 1986, he used his position to advocate for international sanctions against apartheid, and later to lobby for rights globally.\n\nTutu was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997 and underwent repeated treatment.\n\nHis public appearances become increasingly scarce, and in one of his last this year, he emerged from hospital in a wheelchair to get a Covid vaccine, waving but not offering comment.\n\nHe retired in 1996 to lead a harrowing journey into South Africa\u2019s brutal past, as head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nFor 30 months, the commission lifted the lid on the horrors of apartheid.\n\n\u2018Larger than Life\u2019\n\nTutu, with his instinctive humanity, broke down and sobbed at one of its first hearings.\n\n\u201cHe articulated the universal outrage at the ravages of apartheid and touchingly and profoundly demonstrated the depth of meaning of ubuntu, reconciliation and forgiveness,\u201d Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe Nelson Mandela Foundation called Tutu \u201can extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was larger than life, and for so many in South Africa and around the world his life has been a blessing,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nTutu was born in the small town of Klerksdorp, west of Johannesburg, on October 7, 1931, to a domestic worker and a school teacher.\n\nHe trained as a teacher before anger at the inferior education system set up for black children prompted him to become a priest.\n\nHe lived for a while in Britain, where, he recalled, he would needlessly ask for directions just to be called \u201cSir\u201d by a white policeman.\n\nTutu relentlessly challenged the status quo on issues like race, homosexuality and religious doctrine and gave his pioneering support for the assisted dying movement.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t shy away from his own end.\n\n\u201cI have prepared for my death and have made it clear that I do not wish to be kept alive at all costs,\u201d he said in an opinion piece in The Washington Post in 2016.\n\n\u201cI hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life\u2019s journey in the manner of my choice.\u201d\n\nTutu\u2019s death came just weeks after F.W de Klerk, South Africa\u2019s last apartheid-era president passed away on November 11.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has called the Premier League schedule \u201cnot fair\u201d and said his side \u201care struggling\u201d after sustaining more injuries.\n\nThe Blues won 3-1 at Aston Villa on Sunday, with Romelu Lukaku scoring a goal and winning a penalty in his first match back after a Covid-19 absence.\n\nChelsea had a request to have their 0-0 draw versus Wolves on 19 December rejected by the Premier League.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like it is \u2013 but this cannot be the right way,\u201d said Tuchel.\n\nWhile 15 top-flight matches have been postponed so far in December, Chelsea were playing their eighth game in all competitions in the month and have Brighton to come at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.\n\nCallum Hudson-Odoi and Lukaku have both missed games because of Covid-19, while forwards Kai Havertz and Timo Werner were still absent and defender Thiago Silva and midfielder N\u2019Golo Kante picked up injuries in the win at Villa Park.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d added Tuchel. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in bed for 10 days and we play against teams who prepare with games postponed, and who prepare with one week for these matches.\n\n\u201cThey make us play all the time, even if we have Covid. We have new injuries and it won\u2019t stop. People at the green table, in offices, make these decisions.\n\n\u201cWe are struggling, we\u2019re pressing our players. I have maximum respect for what the players did. We do changes because of injuries. We don\u2019t change for tactical reasons any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impressed with my players but super concerned,\u201d added Tuchel. \u201cMaybe we made a big mistake letting players play after corona and one or two training sessions.\n\n\u201cBut obviously they [the Premier League] made us play and so we play.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated his call for five substitutes to be allowed in the Premier League again to help deal with the pandemic, but he said there was \u201czero chance\u201d of that happening.\n\n\u201cWe are not protecting the players because we are the only league who doesn\u2019t have five changes,\u201d Tuchel said.\n\nThe rule has remained in the rest of Europe\u2019s top leagues since it was introduced in summer 2020.\n\nVilla assistant manager Gary McAllister, who was standing in for boss Steven Gerrard after he tested positive for Covid, said bringing back five substitutes was \u201ca must\u201d.\n\nSouthampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl said his team will have to \u201cmake a miracle\u201d to face Tottenham on Tuesday, scheduled just over 48 hours after their 3-2 victory over West Ham.\n\n\u201cWe face a very strong side with two days\u2019 rest and no chance for training. We have to have a good hand in picking the right players and hope that we do,\u201d Hasenhuttl said.\n\n\u201cWe have no time to prepare and we have to see who is fit, but this is what we have to do if you want something from the Premier League.

We have Covid times, we have three competitions in which we have high ambitions and want to be as successful as we can be.\n\n\u201cSo far, as far as I know, there has been no offer from any other club and as long as this is the case he will stay.\u201d\n\nRangnick also said he shares Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp\u2019s concerns over signing players who are not vaccinated against coronavirus.\n\nKlopp recently said a player\u2019s vaccinated status would be \u201cinfluential\u201d in the club\u2019s decision to sign them.\n\n\u201cI think it could be a consideration,\u201d Rangnick said.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue the clubs seriously have to think about. If you sign a player knowing from the first day that he has not been vaccinated, you have to be aware he might not be available.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only for 10 days, but this could happen regularly in Covid times.\u201d\n\nUnited had to shut the first-team section of their Carrington facility due to a Covid outbreak and have had two Premier League games postponed in December.\n\nThe Premier League said 84% of players are on their \u201cvaccination journey\u201d according to recent figures, leaving 16% unvaccinated.\n\nThe figures are in line with comparable age groups across society in the UK.\n\nRangnick used the example of Bayern Munich\u2019s Joshua Kimmich as evidence players should get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\nThe Germany international, 26, recently said he regrets not being vaccinated after suffering a lung problem as a result of Covid-19.\n\n\u201c[Kimmich] was extremely hesitant at the beginning and I think in the meantime he has realised it might be a good idea to get vaccinated,\u201d Rangnick added.\n\n\u201cHe caught Covid and still has some problems with his lungs. I think this is an issue where of course everybody can, and should have, his free will. But in football, especially at this level we are playing at, we need to try to convince our players to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt should be in the interest of the players to be vaccinated, but in the end it\u2019s a decision that each club has to take by themselves and find the best possible solution.\u201d",

They include China Eastern, which cancelled 368 flights, and Air China, with 141 cancellations.\n\nAirports in Beijing and Shanghai appear to be the worst affected, with nearly 300 cancellations combined. The Chinese authorities have not commented on the issue.\n\nThe airport in the northern Chinese city of Xi\u2019an is also on the list. More than 13 million people in the city have been recently ordered to stay at home as authorities attempt to tackle a Covid outbreak there.\n\nMeanwhile, the worst hit US companies are United, with 84 cancellations, and JetBlue which had 66.\n\nUnited warned last week that a spike in Omicron cases had \u201chad a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation\u201d, with many employees required to self-isolate after coming into contact with those infected. Omicron now is the dominant strain in the US.\n\nBut severe weather is also a factor. A blanket of snow delayed flights and disrupted roads in the western state of Washington on Sunday, adding to the travel chaos.\n\nIn the UK, British Airways has 42 cancellations on Monday, according to FlightAware. London\u2019s Heathrow airport has 47 scrapped flights.\n\nNearly 5.4 million people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to America\u2019s Johns Hopkins University.

          "text": "Somalia\u2019s President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed says he has suspended Prime Minister Hussein Roble, sparking accusations of an \u201cindirect coup\u201d amid a protracted feud.\n\n\u201cThe president decided to suspend prime minister Mohamed Hussein Roble and stop his powers since he was linked with corruption,\u201d the office of the president said in a statement on Monday, accusing the premier of interfering with an investigation into a land grabbing case.\n\nRoble\u2019s office called the statement \u201coutrageous\u201d on Twitter, adding that the attempt to \u201cmilitarily take over\u201d the office of the prime minister was in breach of the law.\n\nIn a separate post, it said Roble remained \u201cfully committed to fulfilling his national responsibility to conduct an acceptable electoral process that culminates in a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\n\nAssistant information minister Abdirahman Yusuf Omar Adala called the president\u2019s decision an \u201cindirect coup.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is going on this morning is (an) indirect coup but it will not win,\u201d Adala said on Facebook, adding that the deployment of security forces around Roble\u2019s office would not prevent the prime minister from carrying out his duties.\n\nPresident Mohamed\u2019s move comes a day after trading accusations with Roble of holding up ongoing parliamentary elections.\n\nThe long-delayed elections began on November 1 and were supposed to be completed by December 24, but one newly elected legislator said that, as of Saturday, only 24 of 275 representatives had been elected.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Presidential office said Prime Minister Roble was \u201cposing a serious threat to the electoral process and overstepping his mandate\u201d.\n\nRoble\u2019s office later put out its own statement saying the president had spent \u201cso much time, energy and finances in frustrating the national elections\u201d and was \u201cderailing the electoral process\u201d.\n\nIn the statement, Roble said he would hold meetings to find ways to speed up the election and agree \u201con a capable leadership to spearhead timely and transparent elections\u201d without offering more details on how long the process might take.\n\nUnder Somalia\u2019s complex indirect electoral process, regional councils are meant to choose a senate. Clan elders are then meant to pick members of the lower house, which then picks a new president.\n\nThe president\u2019s move reopens a confrontation that had been resolved when the president put Roble in charge of security and of organising its first direct elections in more than 30 years.\n\nFactions of the security forces allied to Mohamed and Roble in April had seized areas of the capital, as the prime minister and opposition opposed a move to extend the president\u2019s four-year term by another two years.\n\nClashes between the two groups forced between 60,000 and 100,000 people to flee their homes.\n\nMatt Bryden, analyst at the Sahan think tank, told Al Jazeera that \u201cthe prime minister was planning to convene a national conference today to chart the way forward. Now the president has once again intervened and created a situation of real uncertainty and danger.\u201d\n\nBryden added that the electoral model was modified by Mohamed to favour his reelection and this change is now contributing to the impasse in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe entire process has come down almost to cherry picking, where seat by seat we are seeing rigging, we are seeing appointees of the president being given seats, and these are the people who will choose the next president,\u201d he said.\n\nSomalia, which has had only a limited central government since 1991, is trying to reconstruct itself with the help of the United Nations and to fight the al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab.",

          "text": "In Afghanistan, the Taliban authorities say women seeking to travel long distances should not be allowed on road transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative.\n\nThe guidance issued on Sunday by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, which also called on vehicle owners to refuse rides to women not wearing headscarves, has drawn condemnation from rights activists.\n\nThe move followed the Taliban barring many women in public-sector roles from returning to work in the wake of their August 15 seizure of power, and as girls remain largely cut off from secondary schooling.\n\nIt also came despite the group seeking to project a moderate image internationally in a bid to restore aid suspended when the previous government imploded during the final stages of a chaotic military withdrawal by the United States.\n\n\u201cWomen travelling for more than 72km (45 miles) should not be offered a ride if they are not accompanied by a close family member,\u201d ministry spokesman Sadeq Akif Muhajir said, specifying that the companion must be male.\n\nThe new guidance, circulated on social media networks, also asked people to stop playing music in their vehicles.\n\nWeeks ago, the ministry asked Afghanistan\u2019s television channels to stop showing dramas and soap operas featuring female actors. It also called on female TV journalists to wear headscarves while presenting.\n\nMuhajir said on Sunday the hijab would likewise be required for women seeking transport.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s definition of the hijab \u2013 which can range from a hair covering to a face veil or full-body covering \u2013 is unclear, and most Afghan women already wear headscarves.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has slammed the guidance.\n\n\u201cThis new order essentially moves \u2026 further in the direction of making women prisoners,\u201d Heather Barr, the group\u2019s associate director of women\u2019s rights, told the AFP news agency.\n\nIt \u201cshuts off opportunities for them to be able to move about freely, to travel to another city, to do business, (or) to be able to flee if they are facing violence in the home,\u201d Barr added.\n\nEarlier this month, the Taliban issued a decree in the name of their supreme leader, instructing the government to enforce women\u2019s rights, but it did not mention girls\u2019 access to education.\n\nOn Sunday, Afghanistan\u2019s Minister for Higher Education Abdul Baqi Haqqani said the authorities were discussing the issue.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Emirate is not against women\u2019s education but it is against co-education,\u201d Haqqani told reporters.\n\n\u201cWe are working on building an Islamic environment where women could study \u2026 it might take some time,\u201d he said, without specifying when girls might return to school and university classes across the country.\n\nWomen\u2019s rights were severely curtailed during the Taliban\u2019s previous stint in power in the 1990s.\n\nThey were forced to wear the burqa, a full-body veil that covers the face as well, could only leave home with a male chaperone and were banned from work and education.\n\nRespect for women\u2019s rights has repeatedly been cited by key global donors as a condition for restoring aid.\n\nThe United Nations has warned that Afghanistan faces an \u201cavalanche of hunger\u201d this winter, estimating that 22 million citizens face acute food shortages.",
