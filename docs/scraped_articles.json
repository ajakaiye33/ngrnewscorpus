          "text": "The Management of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, on Wednesday, vowed that a professor of Yoruba incantations and Stylistics, Joseph Opefeyitimi, won\u2019t evade disciplinary action for alleged sexual assault on Boluwatife Bababunmi of the Department of Linguistics and African Languages.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the University, Abiodun Olarewaju, the institution said the incident happened on March 18, 2022, and the student petitioned the school management three days later.\n\nThe institution revealed that upon thorough investigation, Opefeyitimi was found prima facie liable and won\u2019t evade the appropriate sanction.\n\nThe statement by the management was titled, \u2018Sex Scandal: Oau Not Foot-dragging\u2019.\n\nIt partly read, \u201cProcedurally, after the receipt of the formal complaints, the first step was that the departmental committee sat on the matter and, after thorough investigation, Professor Opefeyitimi was found prima facie liable.\n\n\u201cSecond stage was the Faculty level and the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, professor Niyi Okunoye referred the matter to the anti-sexual harassment committee of the University. The committee, which also sat and clinically deliberated on this same matter, recommended appropriate disciplinary actions against professor Ayo Opefeyitimi to the University Management.\n\n\u201cOf course, the University administration would have to present its recommendations to the Governing Council which has the final say on the matter, considering the status of the staff involved.\n\n\u201cWe want the general public to be rest assured and be reassured that the present University Management does not condone sexual rascality of any form, under any guise against any member of the University community from anybody. We also pledge to continue to protect our students, particularly the female ones, against any sexual predator, no matter how highly placed.\n\n\u201cAs a mark of its zero tolerance for sexual harassment, the present University Management had summarily dismissed three lecturers who had committed similar sexual offences.\n\n\u201cThe first lecturer to be dismissed was of the department of Management and Accounting while the second one was from the department of English Language. The third one, who was given his letter of dismissal last month, was teaching in the department of International Relations.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Nigerian table tennis legend, Funke Oshonaike, has revealed that she gives her kids mobile phones right from the age of 10.\n\nAccording to her, she also leaves them with babysitters and close friends whenever she goes out to represent the country at competitions.\n\nPosting on Facebook, Oshonaike said she doesn\u2019t beat her children and will fight anyone who dares to beat them.\n\nShe said, \u201cYes, I gave my kids their phones at the age of 10! I leave them with babysitters or with some close friends to help me check on them anytime I go to competitions to represent my country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t beat my kids and I will fight you if you dare. I am not a perfect mother but I am proud of myself and my mistakes because nobody is perfect.\n\n\u201cFor those of you perfect parents, especially you that have no kids yet or yours are still babies, well-done for criticising and judging other parents.\n\n\u201cParenting nowadays is not Moinmoin(sic). You can do your best to train your kids but you might still fail at last! So it takes the grace of God.\u201d\n\nIn an apparent reaction to the backlash received by the mother of a female student of Chrisland School seen in a viral sex tape, Oshonaike reminded the critics that they are also not perfect.\n\n\u201cTo all of you that have been calling the mother of the 11-year-old girl bad names, remember you\u2019re not perfect too.\n\n\u201cAre you always with your child 24hrs? Don\u2019t you sometimes leave your child with a neighbour, babysitters, family or friends?\n\n\u201cDo you know what the people you\u2019re leaving your kids with are teaching them? Do you as a parent give your children enough time?\n\n\u201cStop being judgmental and learn from people\u2019s mistakes. The last time I checked, children of pastors and imam are not always good children. Will you say then that it\u2019s bad parenting?\n\n\u201cYou might be abusing another parent right now but remember that your own report card is coming out soon! Until then, stop the bullying.\n\n\u201cStop being abusive and judgmental. let\u2019s bring out solutions and help people with problems. He who has no sin should cast the first stone.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes to the 11-year-old girl and her parents. May God help you out and may you find peace. #stopbeingjudgemental #stoptheabuse #help.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

So, when I heard the fake news I was disturbed and was like who is this fellow carrying this terrible rumour I knew Mr Governor was alive and with vigour. So, never believed it.\n\nRecall that governor Akeredolu began two weeks\u2019 leave as part of his annual vacation on April 1, 2022.\n\nHe however handed over power to his deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, in an acting capacity.\n\nHowever, when the Governor was away, it was rumoured that he had died in a German hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on arrival in the state, the governor, described the rumour as wicked and politically motivated.\n\nAkeredolu thanked the people of the state, saying that he is very much alive and will return to work on next week Monday\n\n\u201cI left the shores of this country on the March 27, 2022. I was with my party, I was physically present, I was there until the early hours of 27th March, 2022.\n\n\u201cThroughout 26th, I was at the convention of the APC in Abuja and everybody saw me there. I even sat with delegates from Ondo State.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nAkeredolu arrives Nigeria, 24hrs after rumoured death, endorses wife\u2019s Senatorial bid\n\n\u201d I never left them except when I left to greet delegates from South West and other areas. And it was a successful outing for us in Ondo State and for South West as well.\n\n\u201cAnd the second day, I left for Dubai, we had the annual investment meeting, which is Dubai Annual meeting and we were all there.\n\n\u201cSo many Governors, about 13 of us were there. I went principally in respect of our Port Ondo because it was during the previous year that we had a relationship, and with the relationship with Dubai Port, I wanted to solidify.\n\n\u201cIt was not a pleasant vacation, my vacation started on first but from 27th March 2022 it was a working visit to Dubai, I was still working, so my first 14 days did not start until 1st of April, 2022.\n\nAkeredolu added that \u201d I was in Dubai working about the State. About 14 States participated and each State has its stand, and I displayed what we have in Ondo State, our Bitumen, and our Mineral resources. I attended other fora to discuss and project the image of Ondo State\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka has again hit out at President Muhammadu Buhari over the state of the nation, saying \u201cit is finished.\u201d\n\nHe faulted President Buhari\u2019s decision to grant state pardon to some Nigerians convicted of corruption.\n\nThe frontline playwright said the President had placed all his eggs in one basket and that these eggs had \u201csquashed against Nigerian faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\u201d\n\nSoyinka in a statement titled, \u201cA putrid presidential Easter egg,\u201d said, \u201cComing from a leader who had placed all his eggs in one basket, labeled anti-corruption, this is one egg squashed against Nigerian faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt evokes the legend of Pandora\u2019s box, whose contents are alleged to constitute all the ills that plague the world. Putrid to the core, allied to power provocations in numerous variations, such as catapulting a notorious player in the martyrdom of a serving minister of justice\u201d to the hub of governance\u2019s wheel, these define the nature of bequests that have brought the nation to this moment of near dissolution.\n\n\u201cPrecedents are no consolation, no excuses. One states the obvious in remarking that precedents either undermine or reinforce principles, and aspiring offenders, especially in the political domain, are encouraged or inhibited by the ease or difficulty of access to the fount of mercy.\n\n\u201cOfficeholders, we presume, are constrained by the existence of that dangling Sword of Damocles \u2013 simply knowing that one day, the cloak of immunity will turn threadbare, and the awaited day of reckoning finds them answerable. Clearly, not any longer.\n\n\u201cYou will forgive, though disagree with me, I know, for clambering onto the Easter wagon myself, to echo the words of the one whose passage through the world the Easter season commemorates: It is finished!\u201d\n\nRecall that Bishop Matthew Kukah had in his Easter message accused Buhari of destroying Nigeria, saying that every aspect of Nigeria is broken. The cleric lamented that Buhari has successfully divided the citizens on the basis of ethnicity, religion, and region, in a way that the country has never witnessed in its history.\n\nKukah noted that Nigerians have become vulnerable as years of friendships, cultural exchange, and collaboration among the people built over time have now come under serious pressure from stereotyping.\n\nAnd to this the Presidency, responded, accusing the cleric and others of actually being the ones destroying the country with their talks.\n\nFemi Adesina, Buhari\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity said some of his principal\u2019s critics are the ones trying to divide the country, adding that the intentions of such persons would not work.\n\nBut the cleric hit back at President Buhari, his aides and the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, on Tuesday, reminding them that back in 2015, Buhari declared that there would be bloodletting if he did not win the presidential election.\n\nKukah said he brought Buhari and former President Goodluck Jonathan to the table to sign the Peace Accord.\n\nHe recalled that at this critical time in the country\u2019s history, while he fought to ensure that the 2015 election did not result to bloodletting, agents of the current administration such as Femi Adesina, Lai Mohammed and Garba Shehu were working for Orji Kalu, Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar, respectively.\n\nHe suggested that Lai Mohammed, Femi Adesina and Garba Shehu have no right to speak back at him when he talks about issues concerning a country he had stood to defend at its most critical moments.",

Hayab, CAN Kaduna State Chapter is the body that coordinates the fellowship of clerics and the entire Christendom in the state but cannot verify the fact that the said Rev Dr Josiah Nabut was a pastor of any Church in Kaduna State is supplementary proof that the statement telling Kukah \u201cto avoid using the pulpit for political gains\u201d is a forgery and should not be taken seriously.\n\nAccordingly, CAN called on the preposterous group parading itself as NCFN to observe that Bishop Kukah\u2019s homily was for the congregation of his Diocese, hence, is devoid of political affinity but a declaration of the harsh realities impacting the everyday life of the members of the Church.\n\nThe statement explained that the group submits that Kukah has \u201cdeep knowledge of the Bible, \u2026 blessed with the power to dissect socio-political happenings around the world and analyse the same for better understanding\u201d is a testimony that Bishop Kukah is in the best position to speak truth to power and that is what his Easter homily does.\n\nCAN, therefore, admonished what it called \u201cthe mischief-makers under the guise of NCFN dubiously led by the untraceable Rev Dr Josiah Nabut\u201d to desist from employing the name of the Church for personal profits and scoring cheap popularity with the current leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, who under his watch Nigerians cannot sleep with their eyes closed or travel freely due to heightening insecurity across the country.",

          "title": "Stories of impact: Real women, real lives, real growth",
          "text": "Author: Grooming Centre\n\nPublisher: The Grooming Centre\n\nReviewer: Nnedinso Ogaziechi\n\nThe photo-book impressively comes in an exciting photo-album-like package that encases the hardcover book. It does not just come in an earthy calm mixture of brown, blue, red and black dominant colours; there is an alluring picture of an African woman with her unique gap-toothed effervescent smile with unmistakable sharp eyes that tell a story of a certain level of fulfilment and excitement. Under her picture comes the title of the book; Stories of Impact: Real Women, Real Lives, Real Growth.\n\nIn a global community that is now more than ever focused on gender justice, equity and empowerment of women, this photo-book title arouses both social and intellectual curiosity and the repetitiveness of \u2018REAL\u2019 aligns with the visual impact of the cover of a woman so bare of any cosmetic alterations of her womanhood and Africanness. The visual impact of the photo-book packaging and cover deftly prepares any reader for the content it encases.\n\nThe core characteristic of a good photo-book is the profound communication that authors try to achieve with visuals in pictorial format. The photo-book under review achieves this communication style from the cover deep into almost the first twenty pages of the book. The few textual insertions were mainly the preface by the Founder & Chief executive Officer, Godwin C. Nwabunka and some quotations inserted for clarity. The choice of the very symbolic first picture of a woman tending a growing agricultural plant speaks to the deeper impact of the Grooming Centre and heralds every other visual narrative and the accompanying texts. The picture of the various economic sectors with female beneficiaries of the Grooming Centre speaks to the economic and social impact the publishers intended to communicate.\n\nThe adoption of the first-person narrative style by the women was effectively done in ways that translations from local languages and Pidgin English did not affect the content of the stories/testimonies. Given the number of beneficiaries, there was an effective selection style as almost all socio-economic sector beneficiaries were represented with on-site, in-person pictures for clarity.\n\nThe photo-book is divided into five chapters and one hundred and twenty-nine pages. The first chapter, Grooming Nigerian Women in Business seems to encapsulate the core mission of the Grooming Centre. Starting with the UN statistics of the percentage of Nigerian women that have never accessed loans (73%) was a brilliantly intellectual way to start such a story.\n\nEven though there is no folkloric bent to it, it speaks to the fate of Nigerian women and the exclusion game even when other UN statistics show the potential of women as economic power houses in any economy. As an NGO that provides microfinance services for indigent women, the pictorials of the book must be a subtle indictment on other bigger financial institutions and their roles in excluding and disempowering women. The other four chapters are all stories around the success of the Grooming Centre even beyond the women to their families/communities.\n\nI love that the photo-book adhered substantially to the qualities of such an aspect of art. The packaging of the book is excellent and like such artistic materials like painting, films, and others, it is an archival material. The quality of the production is very good. There was a good use of visual effects, and the story-telling style resonates. The book speaks very loudly about women empowerment beyond the popular rhetoric without action. There is a show-and-tell style with faces, names, and states. The spread of the beneficiaries is commendable.\n\nHowever, there is an almost utopian narration that says nothing about the challenges of the Grooming Centre as an institution or even from the beneficiaries. Financial investments and businesses are not as seamless as the narration looks, but there would be room in future editions for corrections. It is a veritable tool for both a re-orientation and introspection about the value of women empowerment for a sustainable economic growth. The stories are as real as the story tellers. Good work.",
          "summary": "Under her picture comes the title of the book; Stories of Impact: Real Women, Real Lives, Real Growth.\nThe visual impact of the photo-book packaging and cover deftly prepares any reader for the content it encases.\nThe picture of the various economic sectors with female beneficiaries of the Grooming Centre speaks to the economic and social impact the publishers intended to communicate.\nThe first chapter, Grooming Nigerian Women in Business seems to encapsulate the core mission of the Grooming Centre.\nThe other four chapters are all stories around the success of the Grooming Centre even beyond the women to their families/communities.",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja\n\nTambuwal submits form, says I will unite Nigerians\n\nGovernor Wike: field me or we lose\n\nObi meets delegates\n\nWe will be fair to all, Ayu assures\n\nThe scramble for delegates by presidential aspirants has intensified as the submission of nomination forms ends today in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe aspirants visited many state chapters of the party yesterday to woo key leaders and delegates ahead of the proposed primary.\n\nEight aspirants have so far submitted their documents to the national secretariat of the opposition party in Abuja.\n\nHowever, more are expected to comply with the directive on today\u2019s deadline.\n\nAspirants who have submitted their forms include Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nOthers are Muhammed Hayatu-Deen, publisher Dele Momodu and Nwachukwu Anakwenze.\n\nHowever, there is no consensus among the aspirants on the proposal for a consensus candidate initiated by Tambuwal, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bala Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nWike yesterday pleaded with party delegates to pick him to avoid defeat in next year\u2019s election.\n\nHe urged members of the National Working Committee (NWC) to back him.\n\nThere was a flurry of activities regarding the presidential primary yesterday.\n\nSokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal submitted his presidential nomination form at the party secretariat, promising to lift the country if given the ticket and elected as president.\n\nEx-Anambra Governor Peter Obi met with the state delegates and promised to fix Nigeria if given the chance to lead.\n\nAbia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu reiterated his support for Wike.\n\nFormer Deputy Chairman South, Chief Olabode George, cautioned against jettisoning zoning.\n\nHe was also of the opinion that the party would fail if it kept the presidential ticket in the North.\n\nWike, the Rivers State governor, who met with the NWC members led by party chair Iyorchia Ayu, said: \u201cField me or lose the presidential election. I request you all to campaign for me to get the PDP presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman, since I know that members of the NWC are also delegates, I come to present myself to you and also woo you because you are entitled to vote.\n\n\u201cI am wooing you to vote for me because I have the capacity to make PDP win the election in 2023.\n\n\u201cTo show you how serious I am, I did not come here to negotiate for vice president. I came here to win this election and I will win this primary on May 28/29.\n\n\u201cPDP requires people like us to face the APC. Everybody in this country knows me because of my views on national issues.\n\n\u201cNobody can say I don\u2019t know whether Wike will do this or do that. When I see issues, I say my view and I am not going to run away from it.\u201d\n\nThe governor dismissed the call by some aspirants for a consensus presidential candidate, saying that it smacked of conspiracy.\n\nWike said he had consulted widely in his quest for the ticket, stressing that 2023 was the last chance the PDP has to bounce back to power.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we lose this election in 2023, God forbid.\n\n\u201cThe only way God can forbid is to give the man who has the capacity to win the election the ticket. I sat down, looked at myself and checked the records. What does PDP want?\n\n\u201cYou must be courageous if you want to be a leader. You must be fearless and you must have the capacity. I am courageous and fearless and I have the capacity.\n\n\u201cIf you allow me to fly the flag of the party, which I know by the grace of God, I will be the candidate, and I become President, one of the things I will do is to address the disconnect between the party and the government.\n\n\u201cYou all know the role I played to get all of you elected at our last convention because I ensured that none of you campaigned to get to the positions you occupy today.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for you to pay me back for what I did for you. In essence, whether I get the ticket or not, I have no other place to run to other than the PDP because it is not that if I don\u2019t get the ticket, then, I will move to another party. No! You fight in the house, you settle yourselves.\u201d\n\nBut Ayu, who acknowledged Wike\u2019s request for the support of the national leadership, said party leaders had resolved to provide a level-playing ground for all aspirants.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for the services you have rendered to the PDP, which we hope you will continue to render to the party.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, you want a level-playing field from the NWC. On the other hand, you want the NWC to canvass votes for you and vote for your candidacy\n\n\u201cIn becoming President, you have to choose one; you cannot have the two.\n\n\u201cBut let me assure you that this NWC will try to uphold the tradition of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThat tradition since 1999 is running very credible, transparent conventions, starting from Jos to the last one that produced this NWC.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that there will be no foul play, no manipulation. We will certainly do better than what you did in October last year.\n\n\u201cWe will hold an absolutely transparent convention. At that stage, we will try to be the INEC of the PDP; not be partisan.\n\n\u201cWe will try as much as possible to make sure that every member of the NWC works for the party.\n\n\u201cBut I want to also assure you that once you emerge as the candidate of the party, whoever emerges from that point on, we will be aggressively partisan because you want the party to win the election.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything in our power by way of canvassing for votes from the Nigerian people to ensure that the PDP wins the next election because a victory for a PDP candidate is a victory for everybody.\n\n\u201cI particularly like your submission when you made it clear that win or lose, you will never leave the party. You will work for the party. You have done it before and we are very sure that you will do it again.\u201d\n\nThere are 17 aspirants vying for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.",

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin, Abuja\n\nBarring the unforeseen, the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will today ratify the timetable for the party\u2019s primaries.\n\nThe Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) set the tone for today\u2019s emergency meeting during its rescheduled meeting in Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe primaries are scheduled to hold from next month.\n\nAt a crucial meeting in Abuja yesterday, the NWC yesterday considered and approved a timetable for the various primaries to pick party flag bearers for the 2023 general elections.\n\nIt also concluded on the cost for the expression of interest and nomination forms for the various offices from the House of Assembly, National Assembly, governors and the President.\n\nA source within the NWC told our reporter that the committee will present its decision to the NEC for ratification.\n\nThe source said: \u201cBecause the NEC is the highest decision making organ of the party, all our decisions at the NWC meetings of last week and that of today (Tuesday) will be presented to the NEC for approval tomorrow (Wednesday). This will form the main agenda for the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe source however declined to volunteer information on how much the party plans to sell the forms to aspirants.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWait for the decision of NEC. We have made our recommendations. It is for the NEC to approve the various cost pegged to various positions. Mind you, the NWC had approved free nomination forms for all female aspirants, irrespective of the position they want to contest.\u201d\n\nLast week, APC National Woman Leader, Betta Edu, told reporters of the NWC decision to grant women aspirants free nomination forms to encourage more women in politics and for the fulfilment of the 35 per cent affirmative action in governance.\n\nOn the mode of election recommended by NWC for consideration and approval of NEC for the party\u2019s primaries, our source said the party will adopt an indirect primary.\n\nHe said: \u201cArticle 20(3and4) was clear on the mode of primary to be used at our congresses and convention, but for the primaries for the 2023 elections, we have recommended an indirect mode of election. This also will be presented to the NEC for ratification.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the NWC, who spoke in confidence, said the committee will also be seeking the approval of the NEC for the proposed reorganisation of the party\u2019s National Secretariat.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThough we have not concluded on the Transition Committee report, the Chairman will brief the NEC on the preliminary report of the committee and the proposed reorganisation plan of the party secretariat. We hope to look into the Transition Committee report on Thursday.\u201d\n\nThe youth wing of the party may be pushing for a 50 per cent discount on the cost of nomination forms for all aspiring youth at the forthcoming party primaries.\n\nThe decision was reached at a crucial meeting of some youth stakeholders across the country at the party\u2019s national secretariat on yesterday.\n\nThe source said: \u201cIf the party can grant free nomination to women, we gave resolved to push at tomorrow\u2019s (Wednesday) NEC meeting for a 50 per cent cut in purchasing the nomination forms by all our youth. This will go a long way to boost the not too young to run Act recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe have mandated the National Youth Leader to make this case, while some of us are reaching out to other NEC members to support this move.\u201d",

He served as a commissioner before he resigned to join the 2022 governorship race.\n\n\u201cLooking at the political architecture of that zone, Faparusi is one of the few leaders with executive and legislative experience, having at different times served as a member of the House of Representatives and commissioner.\n\n\u201cThere is a common deep-seated belief that since South Federal Constituency 1 has produced the deputy governorship slot, the Senate seat occupier should emerge from Ekiti Federal Constituency II.

But today those whom we accused of looting and destroying this country are now leading a party that came to fight corruption. Thieves are now heroes in APC, they are being given red carpet reception, this is a huge disappointment.\u201d\n\nVasta said while the government is struggling for relevance over it inability to tackle insecurity and rising poverty among Nigerians, the state pardon granted the two former governors had further de-marketed the ruling party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cI have no regret campaigning for President Buhari and the All Progressive Congress in 2015 and 2019, but if i say I am disappointed in this government it is an understatement. Things have gone from bad to worse and nobody is ready to admit the reality because of their selfish political ambitions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC chieftain said it was disheartening to hear some presidential aspirants telling Nigerians that they would continue from where Buhari stopped, wondering whether they are telling Nigerians that the killings will continue or they will continue with the existing hardship and hunger in the land.\n\n\u201cWhoever tells Nigerians that he will continue with what is currently going on in the country means that he has nothing to offer Nigerians. As a member of this party, I am not proud of this government,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the chances of the ruling APC retaining power in 2023, Vatsa said: \u201cI have only one vote, so I think Nigerians will decide.\u201d",

But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country.\u201d\n\nChairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi,however, commended President Buhari for demonstrating resilience and determination at a crucial period in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader, who is not distracted by momentary challenges but has continued to commit to the renewal of our nation and we, governors, ministers and heads of government agencies are equally dedicated to building a better Nigeria, on your watch,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that this year\u2019s Holy month of Ramadan coincided with the just concluded Christian Lenten period, the Governor of Ekiti, said it held enormous spiritual value on the benefits of renewal, sacrifice, almsgiving, forgiveness and healing for the individual as well as the nation.\n\nOn his part, Diri, who spoke when he received the Comptroller of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Bayelsa Command, Mr Sunday James, the Bayelsa helmsman lamented the level of insecurity in the north, saying once a part of the country was in distress, other areas were also affected.\n\nHe said the spate of killings by terrorists in the country was a great setback for Nigeria, where lives could be taken at will and urged the APC-led federal government to effectively curb the killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cI use this opportunity to again call on the federal government to do something. These are the same issues that led to the APC government coming to power in 2015.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you will agree that things are worse now than in 2015. The federal government has to redouble its effort, otherwise, the joker card is with the people of Nigeria. They know what to do come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen one part of the country is sick, it affects the other parts. Kaduna and other states in the North are sick security-wise and it is affecting other parts of the country. Nigeria is very close to the Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u2018state of nature\u2019 where life is described as nasty, brutish and short. The federal government has to do something to keep us away from the Hobbesian state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, James, said the visit was to formally present himself as the new helmsman of the service in the state, and said as the agency in charge of giving clearance to intending foreign visitors, he was prepared to synergise to realise the state\u2019s investment drive.\n\nDiri equally charged the new Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral Idi Abbas, to collaborate with the state government in curbing oil theft, illegal bunkering, kidnapping and related crimes in the maritime domain of the state.\n\nHe acknowledged that having served in the Command in other capacities, Rear Admiral Abbas, would contribute significantly towards sustaining the peace and development of the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe you have distinguished and excelled in your service and will not be a pawn in the chess game of anybody or any political party.\n\n\u201cEnsure that you discharge your functions with utmost professionalism to bring about peace, security and development of Bayelsa and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cSecurity does not know ethnicity. It has no face of political parties and so, let nobody influence you and your Command on politics. We are in a political season and all kinds of characters are on display: the good, the bad and the ugly. The number one thing is to ensure safety of lives and property in our maritime domain and that is the only way we can talk about genuine development.\u201d\n\nAbbas, on his part, also said his visit was to officially present himself to the governor following his posting to head the Command on February 4 this year.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the state government for its support to the Command and appreciated it for the donation of land to build a referral hospital, adding that the secondary school allocated to the Navy would be taken over completely in no distant time.\n\nIn a related development, Diri was decorated as an ambassador against drug abuse by the state command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nThe NDLEA State Commandant, Commander Aminu Ali, conferred the honour on the governor when he led other members of the agency to formally introduce himself as the new head of the command.\n\nTerrorists Kill Three Kidnapped Victims in Kaduna, Threaten to Kill 22 Others over N20m Ransom\n\nSome terrorists operating in Kaduna State had killed three of their victims in the state, and threatened to kill 22 others if a ransom of N20 million was not delivered to them before midnight yesterday.\n\nThe victims were abducted at about 8pm on March 31, 2022, in Anguwan Bulus, a suburb near Sabon Tasha GRA in Kaduna city.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, who visited the community yesterday, the Village Head, Mr. Gideon Goni, said the terrorists called the community on telephone to inform them that three of the victims had been killed and threatened to kill the remaining 22 if by midnight yesterday N20 million ransom was not paid.\n\nHe said on March 31, 2022, the terrorists invaded the community around 8pm, killed two people and abducted 26 others, adding that one person was later released on health ground.\n\nHe said the terrorists gave them a description of a location along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, to pick the corpses of the three persons killed.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists called and said they had killed three of the 25 people being held in captivity and that if we don\u2019t pay N20 million ransom before 12pm on Tuesday (April 19, 2022), others would be killed,\u201d Goni said.\n\nAccording to him, the community was raising some money to secure the release of the victims \u201cwhen the terrorists called us and told us to pick the corpses of three of their victims at Dutse.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to them not to kill anyone. We are appealing to the state and federal governments as well as religious bodies to come to our rescue so that the killings will stop,\u201d Goni said.\n\nOne of those whose family member were kidnapped, said he had been able to raise N7 million, \u201cbut the terrorists insisted on the N20 million or they will keep killing the victims.\u201d\n\nMohammed Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command did not respond to telephone calls, when contacted.\n\nThree Dead, 19 Injured As Explosion Rocks Taraba Cattle Market\n\nThree people were yesterday killed while 19 others sustained varying degrees of injuries, when an explosions rocked Iware Cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nThe incident, which occurred around 4pm at a local drinking spot, sent the entire community in pandemonium as people ran helter-skelter for safety.\n\nThe State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview.\n\nA resident of Iware, Ismael Yakubu, also told THISDAY that the bomber came into the spot in company of another accomplice with the bomb hidden in a polythene bag and disguised as customers.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTwo guys came to the drinking spot as if they wanted to buy Burukutu and after they were served, the one holding the poly bag containing the bomb dropped his beer and the polythene bag and left.\n\n\u201cThe accomplice then said he was going to look for his friend and would come back. After he had also left, the bomb exploded and many people were injured while some others were killed.\u201d\n\nOne of the bombers was, however, apprehended and was killed by the angry mob before security operatives could arrive the scene.\n\nThe corpses of those killed had been deposited at the mortuary while those injured were receiving treatment at a health facility in Iware. Others in critical conditions had equally been moved to the Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo.\n\nIware cattle market is one of the biggest cattle markets in Taraba State and the economic hub of Ardo Kola Local Government Area, which operates every Tuesday.\n\nIG Orders Maximum Security in Schools, Colleges; Hard on Compliance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, yesterday, ordered the review of police personnel and operational assets deployments to schools and colleges around the country.\n\nThe review may not be unconnected with the incessant kidnapping of school children by bandits in the North and the killing of school pupils in isolated incidents, owing to inadequate security by the affected schools in the Southern part of the country.\n\nLagos State government had yesterday shut Chrisland School over alleged sex scandal involving a 10-year-old female pupil during a trip to Dubai.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters said the review was to ensure the protection of schools and colleges, particularly, boarding schools, tertiary institutions and its campuses in areas prone to security breaches around the country.\n\nThe statement said the IG directive was issued at a meeting of the force management team at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, while reviewing the general security in the country including the security of schools and colleges as a result of some isolated incidences reported in some schools.\n\nThe IG slso directed all Commissioners of Police in the 36 States and FCT, tactical commanders as well as their supervising Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) to explore all available options and think outside the box to boost security in and around schools, colleges and student-based communities.\n\nThe IG, therefore, directed detectives/operatives of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) and the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) to ensure sustained surveillance and intelligence gathering activities within various school environments while the Police Airwing was directed to extend its aerial patrols to the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThe IG, however, assured the people that all hands would be on deck to ensure a safe environment for all pupils and students in the various schools and colleges in the country, even as he reiterated the commitment of his administration to diversifying resources towards sustainable security and safety of the citizenry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Soyinka said the pardon showed that the Buhari administration\u2019s anti-corruption fight was over.\n\nEchoing the words of Jesus Christ before he breathed his last, Soyinka said regarding the president\u2019s anti-graft effort, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d signifying the end of his mission.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) yesterday condemned the presidential pardon granted to the two former governors convicted for corruption.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, denounced the disparity in the sentencing of rich and poor convicts in Nigeria, stressing that the justice system is often manipulated to favour influential politicians facing corruption charges.\n\nSoyinka, in a statement, likened the state pardon given to the former governors to an egg smashed against the faces of Nigerians, saying it would take a long time to wiped it off.\n\nThe former governor of Plateau State, Dariye, and erstwhile Taraba State governor, Nyame, were serving jail terms for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, while they were in office.\n\nBut to the surprise and disappointment of many Nigerians, the National Council of State last week approved that Dariye, Nyame, and 157 others serving jail terms be pardoned following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, as approved by Buhari.\n\nMixed reactions greeted the decision, with many condemning it.\n\nHuman rights organisation, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), specifically asked Buhari to urgently withdraw the pardon.\n\nReacting to the pardon, in a message titled, \u201cA Putrid Presidential Easter Egg,\u201d Soyinka said he aligned with Bishop Matthew Kukah, in his Easter message, where the cleric lambasted Buhari.\n\nSoyinka said, \u201cComing from a leader who had placed all his eggs in one basket, labelled Anti-corruption, this is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\n\n\u201cIt evokes the legend of Pandora\u2019s box whose contents are alleged to constitute all the ills that plague the world.\n\n\u201cPutrid to the core, allied to power provocations in numerous variations, such as catapulting a notorious player in the martyrdom of a serving Minister of Justice to the hub of governance wheel, these define the nature of bequests that have brought the nation to this moment of near dissolution. Precedents are no consolation, no excuses.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added, \u201cOne states the obvious in remarking that precedents either undermine or reinforce principles, and aspiring offenders, especially in the political domain, are encouraged or inhibited by the ease or difficulty of access to the fount of mercy.\n\n\u201cOffice holders, we presume, are constrained by the existence of that dangling Sword of Damocles \u2013 simply knowing that one day, the cloak of immunity will turn threadbare, and the awaited day of reckoning finds them answerable. Clearly, not any longer.\n\n\u201cYou will forgive, though disagree with me, I know, for clambering onto the Easter wagon myself, to echo the words of the One whose passage through the world the Easter season commemorates: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Kukah\u2019s homily, the Nobel Laureate said he was impelled not to miss an opportunity to add his own Easter drop \u201cto the overflowing vessel of pietistic sentiments, if only to reassure Christians \u2013 and also Muslims in turn \u2013 that even \u2018we, non-believers, do partake of that same ethical communion to which most humanities aspire.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, your Easter sermon opens up yet again those sluices of juridical hypocrisy to which we dare not cease to draw attention. Such, in the immediate, remains the plight of two young men \u2013 Mubarak Bala and the musician Yahaya Sharif \u2013 one serving a sentence of twenty-five years, the other actually sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018blasphemy\u2019 comes into its authentic mode, in my view, whenever anyone violates a solemn oath of office. It penitentially becomes even redoubled when such violators are pampered with the prerogative of mercy.\n\n\u201cPermit me to call special attention to the following from your (Kukah) sermon: \u2018Religious leaders\u2026. must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam.\n\n\u201c\u2019While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that he was persuaded that the recent largesse from the president had already won a few hearts and minds to the ranks, \u201cif not of outright atheism, then at least to a healthy sceptical regard of piety spouting leadership that saw nothing wrong in attempts to extinguish the life of a young man for an honest declaration of conviction, while veterans of broken pledges were let loose to further infect a world they had betrayed.\n\n\u201cNo pardon has been extended in the direction of endangered, youthful integrity. Of course, it is easy to track the trajectory of events.\n\n\u201cNettled by increasingly scabrous comments, such as those of his predecessor in office, Olusegun Obasanjo, who declared that this incumbent has run out of ideas, that he has nothing left to offer the nation, Muhammad Buhari decided to embark on the Easter train and donate an Easter egg of truly presidential proportions to his subjects.\u201d\n\nFalana Condemns Disparity in Justice System, Says Influential Politicians Getting Away with Corruption\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Inaugural Public Lecture of Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Oyo State, Falana stated that some personalities in the society seemed to be \u201cuntouchable, since they have the money, they can influence and manipulate the justice system in their favour.\u201d\n\nIn his paper titled, \u201cSentencing Rich and Poor Convicts In Nigeria: An Unbalanced Scale,\u201d Falana identified the dysfunctional justice system operated by Nigerian courts as the main problem with the justice system.\n\nHe said, \u201cOwing to the class character of the society, the courts and law enforcement agencies tend to favour rich convicts against poor convicts. This problem has caused the public to lose hope and trust in the country\u2019s judicial system.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer stated that drastic \u201csteps must be taken to address the issue of disparity in sentencing, to ensure justice, fairness, and equality before the law, for all convicts.\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, some influential Nigerians commit crimes and get away with it, owing to corruption and the abysmally compromised system.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome persons convicted and sentenced and jailed were never found in any correctional centre while unemployed young people serve prison terms in lieu of rich convicts.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cJudges could even be coerced into favouring those rich offenders against their own will. But there is often no one to speak for the poor, who often have no voice of their own. On the few occasions that the rich are convicted, they are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors.\n\n\u201cCorruption: this is also one of the major issues affecting the fair administration of justice in Nigeria. Oftentimes, rich defendants engage in dilatory tactics, which frustrate and compel the state to enter into plea bargain with them.\n\n\u201cJudges award lighter sentences to convicted rich defendants or resort to technicalities to free them. Otherwise, how could someone that embezzled pension funds worth billions of Naira be sentenced to only six months imprisonment, but another who stole a cheap telephone handset be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment?\n\n\u201cInjustice: there is also obvious injustice against the poor. More attention is being paid to cases involving the rich, as opposed to the poor.\n\n\u201cI will highlight a few cases to illustrate my point. First, is the case of Tafa Balogun, the former Inspector General of Police. After his arrest and arraignment by EFCC for corruptly enriching himself to the tune of N17 billion, Tafa Balogun went to court challenging the powers of the EFCC to prosecute him. He later withdrew the case from court and the EFCC\u2019s case against him was eventually decided when he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly a case of plea bargaining, as the withdrawal of his case from court led to the negotiation by which his punishment was reduced to six months imprisonment after forfeiting some of his loots to the government.\n\n\u201cAnother incident of plea bargaining was the case of former Governor of Bayelsa State, Dieprieye Alamiesiegha. He, too, was arrested and taken to court by the EFCC, who, after entering into negotiation with the accused, reduced the charges against him to six. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment while he refunded some amount of money into the government coffers.\n\n\u201cSimilar thing happened in the case of Lucky Igbinedon, the former Governor of Edo State, who was fined the sum of N3.5 million after he had entered into a plea bargain with EFCC to reduce the 191-count charge against him to just a single count. Though Igbinedion walked away a free man in Nigeria, he was effectively barred by the United States Government on January 12, 2013 from entering its territory henceforth.\n\n\u201cIn the case of John Yusuf, who embezzled N27.2 billion pension fund of retired police officers, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment or a fine of N750,000.00 that being the maximum punishment provided for in Section 309 of the Penal Code under which he was charged!\n\n\u201cMrs. Cecilia Ibru, the former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Oceanic Bank Plc. Mrs. Ibru was arraigned before the court by the EFCC on a 25-count charge of different charges of corruption while in office. After negotiation with the anti-corruption body, the charges against her were reduced to three.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the plea bargaining between the EFCC and Mrs. Ibru, the accused decided to plead guilty to the reduced charges of mismanagement and abuse of office. Thereafter, Kola Awodein, (SAN), who appeared for the EFCC, subsequently informed the court that the commission had reached an agreement with Mrs. Ibru and the said agreement had been filed in court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria added, \u201cOn Friday, the 8th day of October, 2010, the trial judge, Justice Dan Abutu of the Federal High Court, Lagos, delivered judegment in the matter. He sentenced the accused to six months imprisonment on each of the three counts and directed that the sentences should run concurrently. This means the convict was to spend only six months in prison.\n\n\u201cThe convict, however, forfeited N191 billion worth of properties and assets to the government, according to the judgement of the court. Among the properties so forfeited were those in Nigeria, United States of America and Dubai in United Arab Emirates, together with shares in more than 100 companies, most of them listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe judge ordered Mrs. Ibru to be taken to Reddington Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos by the prison authorities within two hours after they receive the copy of the judgement and she is to remain in the hospital until she is certified fit to stay in prison custody.\n\n\u201cThe case of FRN v. Sarah Ochepke & 2 Ors , where the Defendant along with two other accused persons were by an Amended Charge dated 9th of February, 2018 arraigned before the Federal High Court, Jos, on three counts charge of conspiracy, to accept cash payment of the sum of N450,000,000 from one Annet Olije Gyen, Head of operations, Jos branch of Fidelity Bank Plc, and did accept and retain the said amount of N450,000,000.00, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law to be paid to an individual(s).\n\n\u201cThe court sentenced the defendants Sarah Ochepke (being the former Minister of Water Resources), Raymond Dabo, and Leo Jitung, to three months imprisonment each, with an option to pay a fine of N1 million each. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 16(1) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2013 (as amended), carries a minimum term of three years imprisonment or a N10 million fine. The judge, however, exercised his discretion and sentenced them to three months imprisonment each or an option N1 million naira each.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Falana said, \u201cThe case of FRN v. Abdulrasheed Maina is one of the few that made a little difference: Maina who was charged with criminal offences, punishable under sections 11(2) (a), 15(3), and 16(2) (c) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, and also acted in breach of the Advance Fee Fraud Act, was in November, 2021, convicted and sentenced to eight years imprisonment, after being found guilty on all the 12-count charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him and his company, Common Input Property and Investment Limited.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered Maina and his firm to forfeit about N2.1 billion that was traced to their bank accounts, as well as another sum of $223, 396, 30, to the federal government, after which he directed that the company should be wound up. It also ordered the forfeiture of Maina\u2019s two choice properties at Life camp and Jabi districts of Abuja, to the government, likewise the auction of a bulletproof car and a BMW 5 Series exotic car that was found in premises of the convict.\n\n\u201cOn March 18, 2022, an Abuja Upper Area Court in the Gwagwalada area council sentenced a 19-year-old student, Hillary Yunana, to four-month imprisonment for stealing spaghetti and noodles from a shop. The convict, a resident of Bassa village, along Airport Road, Abuja, was charged with burglary and theft.\n\n\u201cThe judge, Sani Umar, jailed Yunana after he pleaded guilty to the offence. Umar, however, gave the convict an option to pay N10,000 for each of the charges, or serve a jail term of two months for each of them. He said the sentence would run concurrently and warned Yunana to desist from committing crimes in the future. The judge said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to anyone who wanted to toe the depraved path in the future.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, 2022, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, discharged and acquitted the former Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Andrew Yakubu, of the money laundering charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him.\n\n\u201cThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, held that the anti-graft agency failed to prove its case against the erstwhile NNPC boss. The court ordered that monies the EFCC seized from Yakubu, who was GMD of the NNPC between 2012 and 2014, should be returned to him.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC had on the strength of a tip-off by a whistle-blower, raided Yakubu\u2019s guest house situated at Sabon Tasha, Kaduna State in 2017 and discovered the sum of $9.7million and \u00a374,000 which he hid in a fireproof safe inside the house.\u201d\n\nFalana explained further, \u201cBetween 2005 and 2006, a panel of enquiry instituted by the federal government found that 197 defendants who were tried, convicted and jailed for drug trafficking were not found in any correctional centre in the country.\n\n\u201cAt the end of their trials, members of a syndicate made of prosecution and defence lawyers, court clerks and warders collected heavy bribes from the convicts and allowed them to escape imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was found that the convicts returned to the nefarious business. I took up the matter with the authorities of the NDLEA, who assured me that the convicts would be arrested and made to serve the prison terms. But that was the end of the story.\n\n\u201cOn July 10, 2015, the then Chief Judge of Anambra State, the Honourable Justice Umeadi, visited all prisons in the state for the purpose of jail delivery to decongest the prisons. His Lordship disclosed that some prison inmates have no records in the prisons. The scandal was well reported at the material time.\n\n\u201cSince inmates are committed to prisons by warrants issued by Judges and Magistrates, the authorities of the correctional centre are challenged to explain who authorised the \u2018imprisonment\u2019 of inmates without records.\n\n\u201cAwaiting trial inmates constitute not less than 75 per cent of the prison population in the country. Majority of the inmates, including convicts, are poor people. The few rich people and members of the ruling class that are jailed are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors in exercise of their powers under section 175 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBased on the recommendation of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Council of State has just approved the pardon of a number of convicted persons, including two former state governors that were jailed for laundering billions of naira.\n\n\u201cSince the constitution provides for equality of all citizens before the law, all other persons convicted for stealing, fraud and money laundering ought to be pardoned and freed. There can be no moral or legal justification for jailing poor people who steal spaghetti and noodles to feed their family members while those who loot the treasury are granted clemency or pardon.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, permit me to call on the poor who constitute the majority of poor victims of institutionalised criminal justice system to unite and fight for socioeconomic justice and equality before the law.\n\n\u201cIn particular, indigent accused persons are advised to brief lawyers in the Legal Aid Council and the Office of the Public Defender in every state of the federation to provide them with legal practitioner whenever they are arrested, detained or charged with any criminal offence.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the state to assign lawyers, free of charge, to citizens who earn less than the national minimum wage of N30,000.00.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law is not neutral in a class society. It is made and enacted by rich legislators to serve the interests of the rich. The judges interpret the law to favour the rich and powerful people in the society.\n\n\u201cThe big lawyers hired to defend the rich exploit loopholes and technicalities in the law to free their rich clients. Hence, the poor man who stole noodle in Abuja to feed himself, was jailed by an Upper Area Court. Even though he had no more to feed himself, the judge sentenced him to six months imprisonment or N20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cBut the former top public officer who laundered $9.8 million and \u00a374,000, has been set free by the Federal High Court. The judge blamed the EFCC for not proving the case beyond reasonable doubt!\u201d\n\nPyrates Confraternity Condemns Pardon to Nyame, Dariye\n\nThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) declared that Nyame and Dariye were undeserving of the presidential pardon.\n\nThe group said the pardon had made mockery of the anti-graft law, stressing that it is manifestly undeserving, blatantly discriminatory and distasteful.\n\nFurthermore, it said the Council of State let the nation down by not rejecting the recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy to the former governors, adding that the pardon has effectively killed the anti-graft war.\n\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr. Abiola Owoaje, in a statement titled, \u201cPresidential Pardon for Corrupt Ex-governors: Buhari\u2019s death knell for the anti-graft war,\u201d and made available to THISDAY in Yenagoa, said the intention of presidential pardon ought not to be for the likes of Nyame and Dariye.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) is extremely disappointed by the unfortunate decision of the Council of State. We are saddened that the Council, which courageously, reportedly, turned down a state pardon for former Bank PHB Managing Director, Francis Atuche, also serving jail term for corruption, could not display the same courage and reject the request to pardon Nyame and Dariye.\n\n\u201cWhatever the rationale behind acquiescing to the recommendation of the committee to pardon the two corrupt former governors before serving out their prison terms, the nation has been let down by this eminent body.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the pardon had lent justifiable credence to speculations that its intention was to shore up the battered image of the ruling party and give it a bounce ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nOwoaje pointed out that the presidential pardon was inconsistent with Sections 15(5), 17(a) and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. He added that it \u201calso miserably falls below standards, measures and rules in the United Nations Convention against corruption.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that corruption in the country predated the Buhari administration, adding, however, \u201chis numerous assurances that he would fight and defeat corruption was one of the key reasons Nigerians elected him in 2015 and re-elected him in 2019.\n\n\u201cSeven years down the line, Nigerians are still bearing with the oft repeated refrain that \u2018we must kill corruption before it kills us\u2019 as the only tangible reference to demonstrate the president\u2019s acclaimed commitment to tackle corruption.\n\n\u201cWell-meaning Nigerians had hoped that President Buhari would be able to summon the courage and salvage his administration\u2019s tepid anti-graft war. Sadly, the presidential pardon has made mockery of the war against corruption. Unequivocally, the grim implication of the presidential pardon, aside the demoralising effect it would have on anti-graft officials, is the fact that it has effectively sabotaged the war against graft.\n\n\u201cIt certainly would embolden our well- heeled citizens to engage in corruption with the belief that they can be granted pardon by their friends in government. We have previously recommended to the government steps to take to tackle corruption but the administration\u2019s latest action has shown that it is not willing to lift a finger to fight corruption. In granting state pardon to corrupt individuals, President Buhari has conferred on himself the status of the Chief Undertaker that sounded the death knell for his administrations\u2019 anti-graft war.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Military claims massive air strikes, routing insurgents in North-east\n\n\u2022They\u2019re behind banditry in Imo, says Uzodinma\n\n\u2022As Zulum attributes surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP members to divine intervention\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n\n\nFrustrated by worsening insecurity, amid wide criticism of government\u2019s inability to protect the citizenry, Minister of Defence, Maj-Gen Bashir Magashi (rtd), yesterday, called for God\u2019s intervention in the fight against insurgents and other criminal elements in the country.\n\nThe resort to divine intervention came on the heels of reported military air strikes in the North-east, which were said to have routed scores of terrorists. The terrorists had, allegedly, fired mortar bombs at civilian targets in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, recently. That was as the security situation in the country continued to deteriorate, with armed extremists striking at will, kidnapping many, and killing scores.\n\nIn Imo State, the governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said persons blaming Buhari for insecurity were the ones behind banditry in his state. Uzodimma spoke on Monday in Owerri at the wedding ceremony of Chinedu, son of business mogul and politician, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, which held at the Cathedral Church of Transfiguration of Our Lord (CATOL).\n\nIn the continuing climate of insecurity, terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), yesterday attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, killing two security personnel.\n\nHowever, breathing a sigh of relief, Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the recent mass surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters and commanders was as a result of divine intervention following prayers from all over the world.\n\nThe air interdiction in the North-east came as Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Farouk Yahaya, charged troops to sustain the tempo of attack on terrorists.\n\nThe Nigerian Army Headquarters also reported the killing of an alleged member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State by military troops.\n\nIn his Easter message, Magashi called for religious harmony in the country, and prayed for God\u2019s intervention to give the armed forces victory in their various campaigns against security threats across the country. He assured Nigerians of the military\u2019s commitment to defending the sovereignty of the country.\n\nMagashi said the Easter prayer should also focus on \u201cremembering members of the armed forces presently engaged in various campaigns, for God to grant them total victory over all threats to national peace.\u201d He prayed that this year\u2019s Easter celebration \u201cwill usher in the desired peace and prosperity as well as a complete turnaround for the Nigerian Armed Forces to clear the doubts of cynics and return sanity to the dark spots in the country.\n\n\u201cThe celebration of Easter, which coincides with fasting in the holy month of Ramadan by Muslims, is not a mere coincide, it underscores the need for religious harmony as well as portends spirituality and specialty of this auspicious times of festivities,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nHe urged the Islamic and Christian faithful to embrace peaceful coexistence and religious to make Nigeria a better country for all.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force said, after credible intelligence, it launched a devastating attack on Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters on four gun trucks at Kaffa, killing scores of the terrorists and destroying their trucks. This followed Sunday\u2019s midnight attack by insurgents on Goniri in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, where they fired mortar bombs on civilian targets, killing many civilians and injuring others,\n\nA military update said the Nigerian Air Force also scrambled additional Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location and inflict heavy casualties on ISWAP. It said the aircraft was, at the time of filling this report, still patrolling Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, to ensure that the city remained safe.\n\nSimilarly, the Chief of Army Staff, who was represented by Maj-Gen GM Mutkut, urged troops to avoid any unprofessional conduct while discharging thier duties. Farouk said the troops should redouble their efforts in order to sustain the current tempo in the fight against the insurgency.\n\nHe spoke at the Headquarters Sector 3 OP Hadin Kai and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in Monguno, Borno State, as he joined the Christian faithful and troops of both commands to celebrate this year\u2019s Easter.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Army said troops of 34 Artillery Brigade, Sunday, neutralised a member of IPOB and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN), at Ihioma community, in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\nThe army stated, \u201cTroops\u2019 on routine patrol encountered members of the irredentist group, who fired sporadically at Banana Junction to enforce the illegal sit at home order on law abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cThe IPOB/ESN criminals on sighting the troops withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma Community for reinforcement. In the firefight that ensued during the operation, one of the criminals was taken out, while others fled in disarray. Troops are combing the general area in a follow up operations to track down the fleeing dissidents.\n\n\u201cHaving suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist group has resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops complicity in their mindless atrocities. This propaganda should be disregarded in its entirety.\u201d\n\nPeople Blaming Buhari Behind Banditry, Says Uzodinma\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, took exception to the assumption that President Muhammadu Buhari should be blamed for the spate of insecurity in the state, saying those, who harbour such thoughts, are the ones behind banditry in the state.\n\nUzodinma stated that members of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state had become targets of attack by politicians and their collaborators, alleging that they are behind the banditry and killings in Imo State.\n\nSpeaking at the wedding ceremony in Owerri, Uzodimma said wicked politicians had decided to hold Imo State captive, killing innocent persons and burning public and private property in the name of politics. He urged the Church and the congregation to pray for such persons to repent.\n\nOn Sunday, while addressing the congregation at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Ozuh Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, on Easter, Uzodimma reiterated that the killings going on in the state were politically contrived. He said it was, therefore, pointless to point fingers at Buhari or the governor, as \u201csome soulless persons\u201d were wont to do.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will touch the hearts of these people, who are sponsoring the killing of innocent ones, burning houses and destroying public property in the name of politics,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said it beat his imagination that in the incident, which took place at Ogberuru in Orlu last week, all the victims \u2013 ward chairman, ward secretary and woman leader \u2013 were of the APC.\n\n\u201cI have crosschecked since the inception of this mindless blood letting in Orlu, Orsu and other communities in the zone, not one Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) person has died, their houses burnt or attacked. It is clear to me, therefore, that these killings are the handiwork of politicians who are after the APC members,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined all men of goodwill to remain fervent in their prayers for God to touch the hearts of both the sponsors of the bandits and their collaborators to come to their senses, particularly, in the light of the occasion of Easter, when Christians remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn Firefight, Terrorists Kill One Soldier, Police Officer in Borno\n\nBoko Haram and ISWAP extremists attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, and killed two security personnel.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a large number of suspected Boko Haram elements in many vehicles and motorcycles, armed with sophisticated weapons, invaded the security checkpoints manned by officers of the joint task force, Operation Hadin Kai, comprising military and men of the 30/50 Police Mobile Force (PMF).\n\nMilitary sources said sporadic gunshots rocked the area during the attack, which started about 6pm, forcing many residents of Lawanti Kura, NNPC Depot, and Molai to scamper to safety.\n\n\u201cAfter a fierce battle, one soldier, one Police Sargent, Babangida Yusuf of 50 PMF, were killed in action while one Inspector Chindo Samuel sustained injury.\n\nThe sources stated that one military gun truck and military ambulance were carted away by the terrorists. They were later burnt and abandoned as the insurgents fled on arrival of the military air support.\n\nMolai is situated along Maiduguri-Damboa- Road, which is about 10 kilometres from Maiduguri. The attack came less than 24 hours after the Islamic State spokesman, Abu Umar al-Muhajir, announced on April 17 that it would launch attacks in retaliation for the assassination of its leader.\n\nSurrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP Members is Through Divine Intervention, Says Zulum\n\nBorno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders of Boko Haram and ISWAP was a divine intervention through endless prayers from all over the world.\n\nZulum said this in his Easter message, stressing that the surrender is a miracle towards the healing of Borno State and the North-east.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mass surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders is, certainly, one of Allah\u2019s many miracles towards healing Borno State and rest of the North-east.\n\n\u201cThis mass surrender is the product of the endless prayers citizens across Borno State, the North-east region, rest of Nigeria and, indeed, the world have been offering, seeking God\u2019s intervention to heal Borno State. It is the product of immense sacrifices by the armed forces and volunteers. It is product of repeated calls by political leaders, clergies, elders and traditional rulers, asking insurgents to lay down their arms and embrace peace.\n\n\u201cWe must, therefore, be optimistic in welcoming the likely benefits of disarming, demobilising, rehabilitating and reintegrating mass-surrendered insurgents.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must welcome them without disregarding the risks associated with the programme, hence, the need to sustain stringent security profiling and other Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) procedures that can ensure the overall safety of the programme.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all citizens to fervently pray for the success of our DDR for the mass surrender of those who seek peace, and for the successes of our armed forces and volunteers in frontlines against those who insist on violence.\n\n\u201cMay God grant us enduring peace in Borno State, the North-east and rest of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nZulum added, \u201cIn over 12 years of our battles with insurgents (Boko Haram and later ISWAP) Borno State, for the first time, has a golden window that has the potential of ending the insurgency.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Discloses Addax had two extensions but failed to pay up\n\n\u2022Oil rises to $113 as Libya outages add to Russia supply fears\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, has said under his leadership, no marginal field operator would be allowed to \u201ctrade\u201d in papers issued by the organisation.\n\nKomolafe, who spoke with the Africa Oil+Gas Report, stated that the rule of law would be strictly followed in the issuance of final licences to the winners, stating that no amount of pressure would make the commission award final documents without due process.\n\nThe NUPRC boss also spoke on the Addax issue. He disclosed that when he assumed office, he reviewed the file and observed that two extensions had been granted for payment, but the company could not come up with the money until the award lapsed.\n\nMeanwhile, oil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nStating that the NUPRC \u201cwon\u2019t be arbitrary\u201d, Komolafe stressed that some of the 119 companies that had fully paid their bonuses were insisting that they could not raise funds without collecting the licences.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn many cases the moment people get a letter of award, they write to say they want to assign. Assign what? There\u2019s a phrase in law, frequently rendered in Latin: \u2018Nemo dat quod non habet\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt means \u2018You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have\u2019. For you to get an award, you have to show the proof that you can pay the signature bonus and you can finance the field development.\n\n\u201cYou get it only because you\u2019ve met the requirements. Your award would have been consummated before you can talk of assignment. We shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people making money by trading papers.\n\n\u201cIt is better you have a regulator that abides by the rule of law than to have a genius as a regulator. If you have a judge in court and he decides to rule on the basis of his ingenuity, then, it becomes a ground for appeal.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf you have such a judge, he is a problem judge; he would be abusing discretion. I am going to ensure that our rules and processes give effect to the law. Awards of acreages will be carried out on the basis of fairness, transparency and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nKomolafe, therefore, insisted that until the process was completed, no licences would be issued, stating all decisions would be taken based on strict adherence to the rules.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnyone whose licence is revoked during my tenure will not have a space to challenge. We will take a decision such that everyone challenging it will be standing on very weak ground.\n\n\u201cNow, some of the 119 companies, who have fully paid their bonuses, have formed the required Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to operate the assets.\n\n\u201cThey are asking for their licences, without which, some say, they are neither able to raise the funds for their work programmes, nor start working relationship discussions with the oil majors, who operate the leases from which the marginal fields were ring fenced.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Addax issue, Komolafe said, \u201cIf you were granted an award, it is guided by the law of contract. If you don\u2019t meet the terms, the award reverts to the original owner. It is now the obligation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to find a viable partner to operate the asset.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that the federal government would pursue vigorously the gas flare commercialisation programme, promising, \u201cI am going to rework, rejig it to finalise the work.\u201d\n\nKomolafe hoped that the process would be wrapped up before the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cIn finalising the round, we will ensure fairness, transparency and competitiveness. We are going to ensure very effective regulation that will give effect to the finest spirit of competition,\u201d he pledged.\n\nReiterating that NUPRC was in the process of developing regulations for the activation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NUPRC helmsman noted that the law must be given effect by regulations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere will be public hearings of the regulator, just as you have public hearings for the law making, you must also have public hearings for the regulations of the law. You must have the stakeholders\u2019 hearings.\u201d\n\nKomolafe explained that the PIA provided robustly for abandonment, host community and award of acreages, but argued that it could not be given effect until the entire process was consummated.\n\nOn how he intended to tackle the challenges, Komolafe said, \u201cI came with a revolutionary mind-set. I am a unique person in the industry, going by my background. I intend to do things differently in terms of adhering to processes.\u201d\n\nOil Rises to $113 as Libya Outages Add to Russia Supply Fears\n\nOil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nAdding to supply pressures from sanctions on Russia, Libya\u2019s National Oil Corp on warned that, \u201ca painful wave of closures\u201d had begun hitting its facilities and declared force majeure at Al-Sharara oilfield and other sites.\n\n\u201cWith global supplies now so tight, even the most minor disruption is likely to have an outsized impact on prices,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at brokerage OANDA.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, rose $1.37, or 1.2 per cent, to $113.07 at 1332 GMT, not far from the highest since March 30 of $113.80 hit earlier in the session. United States West Texas Intermediate gained $1.48, or 1.4 per cent, to $108.43.\n\nThe Libyan developments offset concern about demand in China, where the economy slowed in March, taking the shine off first-quarter growth numbers and worsening an outlook already weakened by COVID-19 curbs.\n\n\u201cSome Asian investors booked profits as they became worried about slowing demand in China,\u201d said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.\n\nData showed China refined two per cent less oil in March than a year earlier, with throughput falling to the lowest since October as the surge in crude prices squeezed margins and tight lockdowns hurt demand.\n\nIn March, oil surged to the highest since 2008, with Brent briefly topping $134.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that there were concerns of deeper supply losses looming as Russian production declined by 7.5 per cent in the first half of April from March and EU governments said last week the bloc\u2019s executive was drafting proposals to ban Russian crude.\n\nThose comments came before an escalation in the Ukraine war. Ukrainian authorities said missiles struck Lviv early on Monday and explosions rocked other cities as Russian forces kept up their bombardments after claiming near full control of the port of Mariupol.\n\nAuthorities claimed tribal leaders in southern Libya had shut down the county\u2019s largest oil field \u2014 the latest closure of an oil facility amid a bitter standoff between two rival governments.\n\nOil production at the Sharara field has been stopped and the state-run National Oil Corporation declared force majeure at the field, which produced around 450,000 barrels a day.\n\nForce majeure is a legal manoeuvre that enables a company to get out of its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe corporation called the shutdown of the field an \u201cabsurd move\u201d that mirrored the ongoing standoff in the country. The closure would likely create a fuel crisis in the oil-rich country, as the field was one of the main sources of domestic fuel.\n\nThe corporation did not name those people behind the closure, but its announcement came a few hours after tribal leaders in the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometres (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, said they shut down the field in protest against the government of embattled Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.\n\nThey called for Tripoli-based Dbeibah to hand over power to the government of Prime Minister Fathi Bashagha, who was appointed by the parliament in February to lead a transitional administration after Libya failed to hold its first presidential election in December.\n\nLocal media also reported that residents in the south-eastern district of Whahat announced the closure of all oil facilities in their area, also to pressure Dbeibah to step aside.\n\nOver the weekend, tribal leaders and protesters shut down the al-Feel field and the Zueitina terminal on the Gulf of Sirte, forcing the national oil company to declare force majeure at the two facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Funmi Ogundare\n\nThe management of Chrisland schools has explained why it had to suspend some students over a sex tape which went viral on social media.Some students from the private school located in Victoria Garden City, who were in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for the World School Games in March were involved in immoral acts in a trending video on social media.\n\n\n\nThis school\u2019s explanation is coming after the Lagos State government ordered that all branches of the school in the state be shut down.Surprisingly, the school was silent on the action taken against the staff members in whose care the children were at the time of the incident during the trip to Dubai The management had earlier suspended an 11-year-old female pupil said to have been gang raped, claiming that the girl took part in a truth-or-dare game in Dubai where the students represented the school in the World School Games between March 8 and 14, 2022.The school announced the girl\u2019s suspension in a letter to her parent, describing her conduct as improper behaviour.However, the mother of the girl has called on Nigerians to help her seek justice for her daughter, whom she said the school was trying to silence her daughter in order to cover up the immoral incident.\n\n\n\nIn a statement made available to THISDAY on Monday, a member, Advisory Board of the school, Mr. Akin Fadeyi, said it was scandalised and distressed over the issue, adding that it meted out measured reprimands to them to instil a sense of discipline and as deterrence to others. He added that it was also to caution students on the need to remain on the path of resisting wrong influences. According to him, \u201cThe disciplinary action was in order not to undermine our cohesive culture as a community of future leaders and committed instructors, but to be assertive in handing down the sort of discipline that seeks to correct and reform or children, when they stray from the path of rectitude.\n\n\u201cThe school, he noted, had taken a critical view of the number of students who participated in this trip to Dubai and who did the school proud in its quest to expand the horizons of its students holistically through global exposure, adding that it takes into account a wholesome development of the mind, body and spirit through sporting engagements. Of the 76 children who represented Chrisland, Fadeyi said 71 ensured an untainted adherence to its standards, abiding with laid down regulations and code of conduct, while doing us very proud in the process. \u201cWithin these 71, we kept our girls on the 11th floor and boys on the fourth floor, to draw clear lines that respect moral boundaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were, however, compelled to engage with the parents of the remaining students who unfortunately got themselves involved in misconduct, and in accordance with our code of conduct processes, which are well known to the parents, we meted out measured reprimands.\u201dFadeyi reassured that no rape of anyone or the administration of a pregnancy test on any child took place under its watch saying, \u201cwhile we understand the emotions this has generated, we assure the public that our first approach as an institution was to assume parental roles by offering support to those involved and ensuring that nothing affected their senses of esteem.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because a 10-year-old Chrisland Schools student was allegedly gang-raped, and videotaped about a month ago. She was chosen to represent her school in sports in Dubai.\n\nFirst off, I\u2019m not sharing the video because it\u2019s inappropriate. Second, if you have the video, I beg you to delete it. The girl will be an adult in seven to ten years. Please tell me how you would react if you were in her shoes and saw a video of yourself from ten years ago on the Internet.\n\nFollowing this news, the keyword \u201cParenting\u201d has recently dominated my Twitter trendtables. People\u2019s reactions to the video imply that whatever happened to the girl was the result of poor parenting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can we blame the parents? I mean, aside from parents doing their part, children are products of their environment \u2013 not excluding social media, books, music and movies.\n\nWe can only rant and argue about what is and isn\u2019t true, but parenting is difficult and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nSo, when you become a parent \u2013 or if you are already one \u2013 always give your kids sincere reasons they should or shouldn\u2019t do a thing. If you don\u2019t tell them, someone else could be doing it incorrectly or with the intent to deceive them. Or what do you think?\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022\n\nThe Food Lab plans to drive expansion\n\nETAP\u2019s insurance plan for drivers\n\nGoogle\u2019s Product Development Centre\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that I\u2019ve been mentioning the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS), Africa\u2019s largest Web3 event quite a bit since last week. Today, I\u2019ve got an update I think you\u2019ll enjoy.\n\nWhat is it? It\u2019s the TABS Web3 Hackathon \u201922, and prizes of up to $2,500 are up for grabs.\n\nWhy this hackathon? We want to support Web3-based innovations and products even as we help you learn and understand Web3. We are here to help beginners and intermediates.\n\nWhat are we looking for? We\u2019re looking for unique Web3/blockchain-based solutions to problems in any industry across Africa. While clever and innovative solutions are important, design, functionality, and scalability will be closely scrutinised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn April 20, 2022, participants will pitch their ideas to judges and receive feedback and recommendations. Then, on May 14, 2022, teams who have been shortlisted for the final project submission will meet with the judges for additional feedback. All of this would be done virtually.\n\nWhat about the timeline? Sorry, not sorry, but at this point, I\u2019ll have to direct you to the website where Bolu answered this and other questions you might have.\n\nPlease check it out here: TABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon. Get it directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Intelligence by Techpoint newsletter here.\n\nThe Food Lab plans to drive expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe food industry is evolving. Restaurants and traditional food business models are being affected due to high startup costs, excessive regulation, and the effects of COVID-19. However, it appears that there is an alternative to the traditional kitchen: cloud kitchens.\n\nWhat is a cloud kitchen? A cloud kitchen, also known as a \u201cghost kitchen\u201d or \u201cvirtual kitchen,\u201d is a commercial kitchen space that offers food businesses the facilities and services necessary to prepare menu items for delivery and takeout.\n\nInterestingly, cloud kitchens are becoming more popular in some parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Examples of these are Comida Cloud Kitchen, Food Nation, and The Food Lab.\n\nAnd now, The Food Lab, an Egyptian cloud kitchen provider, has raised $4.5 million in a pre-seed round of funding.\n\nWho are the investors? The round was led by Africa-focused fund 4DX Ventures, Nuwa Capital and Shorooq Partner, while Al Faisaliah Group and Samurai Incubate, and others participated.\n\nThe Food Lab is a cloud kitchen platform, but it also identifies itself as an infrastructure company for Egypt\u2019s food and beverage (F&B) restaurants. It offers a comprehensive set of end-to-end services, including cloud kitchen (kitchen as a service) and procurement.\n\nLaunched by Kareem El Daly (CEO) and Ahmed Osman and Wesam Masoud (co-founders) in 2020, the company says its platform allows \u201cexisting restaurant owners to grow exponentially and new brands to go from concept to launch within just ten days.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, The Food Lab says it is used by more than 50 restaurants and food brands, and 175,000 end customers have placed orders from its kitchens. Consequently, revenues have increased by 25-35 percent month on month.\n\nExpansion plans? The pre-seed funding will allow the company to grow in Egypt and lay the groundwork for future moves into the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nETAP wants to help drivers buy insurance in 90 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of cars on the road in Lagos State, Nigeria. The total number of cars parked outside some gates in my neighbourhood is enough to make you wonder if they outnumber the population of some villages.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA), there are 13 million vehicles on Nigerian roads, with approximately 3 million insured. The maths adds up to uninsured cars reaching 77% and demonstrates how much Nigerians rate insurance. That was sarcasm, by the way.\n\nBut how do we encourage the country\u2019s adoption of auto insurance? ETAP, an insurtech startup, wants to solve this problem.\n\nNigerian insurtech startup, ETAP has raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to expand its team and drive the adoption of much-needed car insurance throughout Africa.\n\nTangerine Insurance, Graph Ventures (which invested in Clubhouse), Newmont, and other angel investors participated in the round, which was led by Mobility 54 (the Venture Capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group).\n\nFounded by Ibraheem Babalola (CEO), the company claims it digitises the insurance purchasing and claiming process, resulting in a seamless and enjoyable insurance experience for users.\n\nETAP says it employs machine learning to create intelligent risk profiles for each driver. This allows them to be rewarded for safe driving with Safe Driving Points that can be redeemed for everyday rewards like shopping vouchers, movie tickets, and more.\n\nBesides, the company claims it has insured over 130,000 individual trips and over 500,000 kilometres in car journeys since its beta launch in November 2021.\n\nBeginning in Nigeria, the new funding will support the rollout of ETAP\u2019s app, which allows drivers to buy insurance in 90 seconds, complete claims in 3 minutes or less, and be rewarded for safe driving and avoiding accidents.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Product Development Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? Yesterday, Tuesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the launch of the first Product Development Centre in Africa in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nObjectives of the launch: It will assist in developing transformative products and services for people in Africa and around the world. Moreso, it will hire visionary engineers, product managers, UX designers, and researchers to lay the groundwork for significant growth in the coming years.\n\nWhat is the centre looking for? It\u2019s looking for talented, creative individuals who can assist in the resolution of difficult and important technical challenges, like improving the smartphone experience for Africans or constructing a more reliable Internet infrastructure.\n\nIn October 2021, recall that Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, announced a $1 billion investment over the next five years to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nPer the company, the new product development centre is a continuation of that commitment, and it will work to build for Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nRecall that Amazon recently announced the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Local Zone in Kenya. In addition, Visa revealed its first African innovation hub. And in 2019, Microsoft opened a development centre in Kenya and Nigeria. Yes, all of this is taking place in Kenya! What do you think Kenya is doing right?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWant to have access to resources to help you thrive on YouTube and build careers on your own terms.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIsn\u2019t it strange that it\u2019s Tuesday but feels like Monday? The vacation is over, and it\u2019s time to get back to work or return to school. If you are a Nigerian student in a public university, you\u2019re probably reconsidering your life because, ASUU\u2026\n\nUnrelated, but I\u2019d like to remind you that you matter, no matter what\u2019s going on in your country or on the continent.\n\nFor example, it is no news that Nigeria and other African countries like Ghana struggle with fluctuating inflation rates. This alone has led to a hike in food prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsidering that Nigeria is the world\u2019s poverty capital, it\u2019s no surprise that things are becoming increasingly difficult daily.\n\nNonetheless, do well to take care of yourself. As my Nigerian people say, \u201cproblem no dey finish.\u201d It never ends.\n\nLearn to enjoy yourself once in a while. There\u2019s no universal definition of what it means to have fun. So, buy that food, binge that show, or hang out with that friend whenever you have time.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t want to stress you out today, so I\u2019ll be discussing two stories.\n\nToday\u2019s gist:\n\nIs NFT an enigma?\n\nUnion54 to launch credit schemes\n\nIs NFT an enigma?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with NFT\n\nDo you remember last week\u2019s story about how NFT is the new oil? The Ghanaian pallbearer NFT meme story? Yeah, that one!\n\nRaymond\u2019s \u2014 a subscriber after my own heart \u2014 response: \u201cNFT is the new oil, really? Ask Jack Dorsey. Lol.\u201d\n\nIf you understand the real gist, you\u2019ll know that he was being sarcastic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Recall that in March 2021, Sina Estavi, CEO of Bridge Oracle \u2014 a public oracle system on the Tron network \u2014 made headlines when he paid $2.9 million for an NFT of Jack Dorsey\u2019s (former Twitter CEO) first tweet.\n\nA few days later, in a tweet, he compared Dorsey\u2019s tweet to the Mona Lisa painting, saying people would realise the true value of the tweet years later.\n\nFast forward to April 5, 2022, Estavi announced in a tweet that he was selling \u201cthe world\u2019s first-ever tweet\u201d for 14,969 ether (over $48 million) and would donate half of the proceeds ($25 million or more) to charity.\n\nWhat happened after listing? He received seven bids ranging from $6 to $277. No, I\u2019m not joking. The highest bid he received was $277!\n\nHaha! Well, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s all I felt when I saw the news. I didn\u2019t know what to think or say. What is this NFT again because I don\u2019t understand it anymore?\n\nBolu \u2014 our go-to Blockchain person \u2014 is always coming through for not just me but us. How? In today\u2019s episode of Techpoint Africa Podcast, he said some things which you\u2019d enjoy listening to, including the train wreck that was his first NFT experience. Trust me, it\u2019s the shortest podcast we\u2019ve ever recorded. Kindly listen to it here.\n\nEntering the NFT market without knowing the fundamentals is a recipe for disaster. I mean, if this could happen to a crypto entrepreneur, Estavi, and our blockchain-go-to person, Bolu, a novice like me should try to understand the market and know how it\u2019s being run.\n\nAnd that is why we\u2019ve organised the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, which will take place on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos. You will not only learn the fundamentals, but you could also learn how to make a career out of it.\n\nHow can you register? Kindly visit and share this link with everyone you like or don\u2019t like. I\u2019m all about freewill \ud83d\ude09\n\nHowever, bids for the Dorsey-tweet NFT have risen to around $10,000 in the last few days. Estavi claims he will not sell for less than $50 million.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort.

It\u2019s an extension because, in November 2021, the startup announced a $3 million seed investment.\n\nTiger Global led this round with Vibe VC, Earl Grey Capital, and Packy McCormick\u2019s Not Boring Capital participating.\n\nLaunched by Perseus Mlambo (CEO) in 2021, Union54\u2019s API enables African software companies to issue and manage debit cards without the assistance of a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe company claims it has issued slightly more than 500,000 virtual debit cards to its customers since its October launch. It also participated in Y Combinator\u2019s summer batch 2021.\n\nBesides that, Mlambo says they have customers from all over Africa, and based on several interactions with them, they\u2019ve identified some of the most pressing issues they face. They include longer settlement times for card transactions and difficulty sourcing funds. So, they intend to develop a card scheme to address this issue.\n\nWhat are card schemes? They are payment networks linked to payment cards like debit and credit cards. Examples of these are Union Pay, Visa, and Mastercard.\n\nUnion54\u2019s goal is to be a local alternative to Mastercard and Visa and assist merchants with settlement and sourcing issues. Consequently, the company plans to launch this framework with nine central banks by the end of the year, with a pilot scheduled for Q2 2023.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

So, when I heard the fake news I was disturbed and was like who is this fellow carrying this terrible rumour I knew Mr Governor was alive and with vigour. So, never believed it.\n\nRecall that governor Akeredolu began two weeks\u2019 leave as part of his annual vacation on April 1, 2022.\n\nHe however handed over power to his deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa, in an acting capacity.\n\nHowever, when the Governor was away, it was rumoured that he had died in a German hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on arrival in the state, the governor, described the rumour as wicked and politically motivated.\n\nAkeredolu thanked the people of the state, saying that he is very much alive and will return to work on next week Monday\n\n\u201cI left the shores of this country on the March 27, 2022. I was with my party, I was physically present, I was there until the early hours of 27th March, 2022.\n\n\u201cThroughout 26th, I was at the convention of the APC in Abuja and everybody saw me there. I even sat with delegates from Ondo State.\n\nAkeredolu arrives Nigeria, 24hrs after rumoured death, endorses wife\u2019s Senatorial bid\n\n\u201d I never left them except when I left to greet delegates from South West and other areas. And it was a successful outing for us in Ondo State and for South West as well.\n\n\u201cAnd the second day, I left for Dubai, we had the annual investment meeting, which is Dubai Annual meeting and we were all there.\n\n\u201cSo many Governors, about 13 of us were there. I went principally in respect of our Port Ondo because it was during the previous year that we had a relationship, and with the relationship with Dubai Port, I wanted to solidify.\n\n\u201cIt was not a pleasant vacation, my vacation started on first but from 27th March 2022 it was a working visit to Dubai, I was still working, so my first 14 days did not start until 1st of April, 2022.\n\nAkeredolu added that \u201d I was in Dubai working about the State. About 14 States participated and each State has its stand, and I displayed what we have in Ondo State, our Bitumen, and our Mineral resources. I attended other fora to discuss and project the image of Ondo State\u201d.",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF), has raised its 2022 economic growth forecast for Nigeria to forecast to 3.4 percent.\n\nThe IMF which stated this at its April World Economic Outlook, WEO, report released as part of activities at the ongoing IMF/World Bank spring meeting in Washington, cited increase in crude oil prices for the upward review.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution, however, reduced its projection for global growth to 3.6 per cent in both 2022 and 2023, citing the impact of costly humanitarian crisis economic damage from the Russia war on Ukraine.\n\nThe new forecast represents 0.7 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points higher than the 2.7 percent projected by the IMF in January for the country\u2019s economic growth in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe IMF also upgraded its economic growth forecast for the Sub-Saharan African region to 3.8 per cent in 2022, representing a 0.1 percentage point increase from the 3.7 per cent forecast made in January.\n\nThe IMF said: \u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa, food prices are also the most important channel of transmission, although in slightly different ways. Wheat is a less important part of the diet, but food in general is a larger share of consumption.\n\n\u201cHigher food prices will hurt consumers\u2019 purchasing power\u2014particularly among low-income households\u2014and weigh on domestic demand. Social and political turmoil, most notably in West Africa, also weigh on the outlook.\n\n\u201cThe increase in oil prices has however lifted growth prospects for the region\u2019s oil exporters, such as Nigeria. Overall, growth in sub-Saharan Africa is projected at 3.8 percent in 2022.\u2033\n\nOn the decision to revised downward its projection for global economic growth, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department, IMF, said: \u201cCompared to our January forecast, we have revised our projection for global growth downwards to 3.6 percent in both 2022 and 2023.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the direct impact of the war on Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, with both countries projected to experience steep contractions. This year\u2019s growth outlook for the European Union has been revised downward by 1.1 percentage points due to the indirect effects of the war, making it the second largest contributor to the overall downward revision\n\n\u201cThe war adds to the series of supply shocks that have struck the global economy in recent years. Like seismic waves, its effects will propagate far and wide\u2014through commodity markets, trade, and financial linkages.\u201d\n\nInflation\n\nThe IMF also projected inflation to rise further across the global economy due to the impact of the war.\n\n\u201cInflation is expected to remain elevated for longer than in the previous forecast, driven by war-induced commodity price increases and broadening price pressures. For 2022, inflation is projected at 5.7 percent in advanced economies and 8.7 percent in emerging market and developing economies\u20141.8 and 2.8 percentage points higher than projected in January. Although a gradual resolution of supply-demand imbalances and a modest pickup in labor supply are expected in the baseline, easing price inflation eventually, uncertainty again surrounds the forecast.\n\n\u201cConditions could significantly deteriorate. Worsening supply-demand imbalances\u2014 including those stemming from the war\u2014and further increases in commodity prices could lead to persistently high inflation, rising inflation expectations, and stronger wage growth\u201d, the IMF said.",

One of them is the issue of appointments. Some critics said we sidelined Muslims in Ogbomoso.

          "text": "By Deborah Coker\n\nThe National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has said that Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), has now become the destination of choice for human traffickers.\n\nMr. Nduka Nwanwenne, Zonal Commander, NAPTIP, Benin Zonal Command, made the disclosure on Wednesday, in Benin, at the commencement of a three-day sensitisation programme on human trafficking.\n\nNwanwenne explained that against the norm where victims of human trafficking were transported by their traffickers by land to their destinations, victims were now air transported.\n\n\u201cThis is because the human traffickers have stepped up their game, and the destination of choice of victims of human trafficking is now Dubai.\n\n\u201cHuman Trafficking is not abating in the country, because traffickers make so much money from their victims so they take it as a business.\n\n\u201cThe traffickers are now also concentrating on rural areas for recruitment of their victims\u201d, he said.\n\nThe zonal commander also revealed that irregular migration was also been used as a ploy for human trafficking, such that its victims were being exploited for their organs.\n\n\u201cThere is now an increase in organ harvesting not just for money rituals, but also for transplants.\n\n\u201cThis is because the need for organs is higher than the supply\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile noting that the issue of human trafficking was still on the front burner, Nwanwenne said that there was the need for partnership to end human trafficking.\n\nHe said that baby sales/baby factory operations were part of human trafficking and that there was the need for concerted efforts to end human trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs security agencies, we must be alive to our duties. We must join hands with the government to fight the issue of human trafficking. I must also advise parents to stop putting pressure on their children to go and make money.\n\n\u201cParents should control themselves and give birth to only the number of children they can cater for,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Segun Sanwo, representing the team lead for A-TIPSOM, Nigeria, said that the organisation believed that prevention was the bedrock to solving human trafficking.\n\nSanwo said that creating awareness was also a key to the fight against human trafficking, but that fighting the menace rested with individuals.\n\nIn her goodwill message, Mrs Adefunke Abiodun, first zonal commander, NAPTIP, Benin Zonal Office, said that NAPTIP couldn\u2019t fight human trafficking alone.\n\nShe said that everyone needed to work collaboratively to make progress, as the fight against human trafficking was a collective thing.\n\nThe sensitisation programme was organised in partnership with the Action Against Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Immigrants in Nigeria (A-TIPSOM) Nigeria.\n\nThe programme was funded by the European Union (EU) and implemented by the International Ibero-America Foundation for Administration and Public Policies (FIIAPP), a Spanish Government Foundation.",

In particular, insurance and insurance-linked financial activities are increasingly crossing national and sectorial boundaries.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the efficient and timely exchange of information among supervisory bodies, both within the insurance sector and across the financial services sector within the West African sub region is critical to the effective supervision of internationally active insurers, insurance groups and financial conglomerates which is also essential in the context for the effective supervision of the financial system as a whole,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nETAP, an insurtech startup that makes it easier to buy and claim insurance, has secured $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to grow its team and drive the adoption of much-needed car insurance across Africa. Starting in Nigeria, the new funding will support the roll-out of ETAP\u2019s game-changing app which allows drivers to buy insurance in 90 seconds, complete claims in 3 minutes or less and get rewarded for good driving and avoiding accidents.\n\nThe pre-seed funding round was led by Mobility 54 (the Venture Capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group), with participation from Tangerine Insurance, Graph Ventures (invested in Clubhouse), Newmont and other angel investors. Working with a wide range of automotive value chain players, ETAP will also explore other opportunities to deliver much-needed insurance services for car owners in other countries across the continent.\n\nDespite longstanding regulation making car insurance compulsory and more than 100,000 car accidents reported between January 2019 and December 2021, only one in five cars in Nigeria are currently insured. The complexities of buying and claiming insurance has led to widespread apathy for traditional insurance companies and products, with many car owners opting to go without insurance. With ETAP, the entire process of buying and claiming insurance happens exclusively on a smartphone, enabling a seamless and enjoyable insurance experience for users.\n\nETAP uses machine learning to build intelligent risk profiles that determine appropriate premiums for each driver, allowing them to achieve lower premiums by driving safely. Using advanced telematics, the driving experience is gamified to improve driving behaviour and drivers can earn Safe Driving Points that can be exchanged for shopping vouchers for the most in-demand retail outlets, fuel, cinema and concert tickets, and other exciting experiences. Drivers also have flexible coverage options, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual plans depending on their needs. In the unfortunate event of an accident, they simply need to take a picture of the affected part of the car via the app and the artificial intelligence processes the claim based on previously uploaded images. The app comes with geolocation tags, timestamps and other features to prevent fraudulent claims, as well as crash notification, emergency support and more.\n\nSince launching in beta in November 2021, ETAP has insured more than 130,000 individual trips and over 500,000 kilometres in car journeys, which represents more than eight times the total distance of paved roads in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Ibraheem Babalola, CEO and founder of ETAP, \u201cJust like any other digital service, we believe Nigerians should be able to buy and claim car insurance without having to \u2018call a guy\u2019. We also believe that rewarding good drivers can be a catalyst for better driving and making our roads safer. This is why we have created Africa\u2019s most powerful car insurance app and we are excited to have raised these funds to bring more users on board. Too often, the process of buying and claiming insurance in Africa is so out of touch with the everyday reality of most people but we are changing the game and making the process just as enjoyable as any other experience that consumers access on the mobile phone.\u201d\n\nYumi Takagi, Project Manager at Mobility 54 said, \u201cETAP is addressing many challenges that impact the automotive experience in Africa and we are excited to support and work with them to bring their innovation to more drivers across the continent. We believe that ETAP will engage with this important role and revolutionize the automotive insurance industry with their powerful technology.",

          "title": "Soyinka to Buhari: Pardoning Dariye, Nyame Means \u2018It Is Finished\u2019",
          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, on Tuesday joined the growing number of eminent Nigerians and groups that have condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant a presidential pardon to former governors, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame. Soyinka said the pardon showed that the Buhari administration\u2019s anti-corruption fight was over.\n\nEchoing the words of Jesus Christ before he breathed his last, Soyinka said regarding the president\u2019s anti-graft effort, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d signifying the end of his mission.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) on Tuesday condemned the presidential pardon granted to the two former governors convicted for corruption.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, denounced the disparity in the sentencing of rich and poor convicts in Nigeria, stressing that the justice system is often manipulated to favour influential politicians facing corruption charges.\n\nSoyinka, in a statement, likened the state pardon given to the former governors to an egg smashed against the faces of Nigerians, saying it would take a long time to wiped it off.\n\nThe former governor of Plateau State, Dariye, and erstwhile Taraba State governor, Nyame, were serving jail terms for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, while they were in office.\n\nBut to the surprise and disappointment of many Nigerians, the National Council of State last week approved that Dariye, Nyame, and 157 others serving jail terms be pardoned following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, as approved by Buhari.\n\nMixed reactions greeted the decision, with many condemning it.\n\nHuman rights organisation, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), specifically asked Buhari to urgently withdraw the pardon.\n\nReacting to the pardon, in a message titled, \u201cA Putrid Presidential Easter Egg,\u201d Soyinka said he aligned with Bishop Matthew Kukah, in his Easter message, where the cleric lambasted Buhari.\n\nSoyinka said, \u201cComing from a leader who had placed all his eggs in one basket, labelled Anti-corruption, this is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\n\n\u201cIt evokes the legend of Pandora\u2019s box whose contents are alleged to constitute all the ills that plague the world.\n\n\u201cPutrid to the core, allied to power provocations in numerous variations, such as catapulting a notorious player in the martyrdom of a serving Minister of Justice to the hub of governance wheel, these define the nature of bequests that have brought the nation to this moment of near dissolution. Precedents are no consolation, no excuses.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added, \u201cOne states the obvious in remarking that precedents either undermine or reinforce principles, and aspiring offenders, especially in the political domain, are encouraged or inhibited by the ease or difficulty of access to the fount of mercy.\n\n\u201cOffice holders, we presume, are constrained by the existence of that dangling Sword of Damocles \u2013 simply knowing that one day, the cloak of immunity will turn threadbare, and the awaited day of reckoning finds them answerable. Clearly, not any longer.\n\n\u201cYou will forgive, though disagree with me, I know, for clambering onto the Easter wagon myself, to echo the words of the One whose passage through the world the Easter season commemorates: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Kukah\u2019s homily, the Nobel Laureate said he was impelled not to miss an opportunity to add his own Easter drop \u201cto the overflowing vessel of pietistic sentiments, if only to reassure Christians \u2013 and also Muslims in turn \u2013 that even \u2018we, non-believers, do partake of that same ethical communion to which most humanities aspire.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, your Easter sermon opens up yet again those sluices of juridical hypocrisy to which we dare not cease to draw attention. Such, in the immediate, remains the plight of two young men \u2013 Mubarak Bala and the musician Yahaya Sharif \u2013 one serving a sentence of twenty-five years, the other actually sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018blasphemy\u2019 comes into its authentic mode, in my view, whenever anyone violates a solemn oath of office. It penitentially becomes even redoubled when such violators are pampered with the prerogative of mercy.\n\n\u201cPermit me to call special attention to the following from your (Kukah) sermon: \u2018Religious leaders\u2026. must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam.\n\n\u201c\u2019While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that he was persuaded that the recent largesse from the president had already won a few hearts and minds to the ranks, \u201cif not of outright atheism, then at least to a healthy sceptical regard of piety spouting leadership that saw nothing wrong in attempts to extinguish the life of a young man for an honest declaration of conviction, while veterans of broken pledges were let loose to further infect a world they had betrayed.\n\n\u201cNo pardon has been extended in the direction of endangered, youthful integrity. Of course, it is easy to track the trajectory of events.\n\n\u201cNettled by increasingly scabrous comments, such as those of his predecessor in office, Olusegun Obasanjo, who declared that this incumbent has run out of ideas, that he has nothing left to offer the nation, Muhammad Buhari decided to embark on the Easter train and donate an Easter egg of truly presidential proportions to his subjects.\u201d\n\nFalana Condemns Disparity in Justice System, Says Influential Politicians Getting Away with Corruption\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday at the Inaugural Public Lecture of Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Oyo State, Falana stated that some personalities in the society seemed to be \u201cuntouchable, since they have the money, they can influence and manipulate the justice system in their favour.\u201d\n\nIn his paper titled, \u201cSentencing Rich and Poor Convicts In Nigeria: An Unbalanced Scale,\u201d Falana identified the dysfunctional justice system operated by Nigerian courts as the main problem with the justice system.\n\nHe said, \u201cOwing to the class character of the society, the courts and law enforcement agencies tend to favour rich convicts against poor convicts. This problem has caused the public to lose hope and trust in the country\u2019s judicial system.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer stated that drastic \u201csteps must be taken to address the issue of disparity in sentencing, to ensure justice, fairness, and equality before the law, for all convicts.\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, some influential Nigerians commit crimes and get away with it, owing to corruption and the abysmally compromised system.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome persons convicted and sentenced and jailed were never found in any correctional centre while unemployed young people serve prison terms in lieu of rich convicts.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cJudges could even be coerced into favouring those rich offenders against their own will. But there is often no one to speak for the poor, who often have no voice of their own. On the few occasions that the rich are convicted, they are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors.\n\n\u201cCorruption: this is also one of the major issues affecting the fair administration of justice in Nigeria. Oftentimes, rich defendants engage in dilatory tactics, which frustrate and compel the state to enter into plea bargain with them.\n\n\u201cJudges award lighter sentences to convicted rich defendants or resort to technicalities to free them. Otherwise, how could someone that embezzled pension funds worth billions of Naira be sentenced to only six months imprisonment, but another who stole a cheap telephone handset be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment?\n\n\u201cInjustice: there is also obvious injustice against the poor. More attention is being paid to cases involving the rich, as opposed to the poor.\n\n\u201cI will highlight a few cases to illustrate my point. First, is the case of Tafa Balogun, the former Inspector General of Police. After his arrest and arraignment by EFCC for corruptly enriching himself to the tune of N17 billion, Tafa Balogun went to court challenging the powers of the EFCC to prosecute him. He later withdrew the case from court and the EFCC\u2019s case against him was eventually decided when he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly a case of plea bargaining, as the withdrawal of his case from court led to the negotiation by which his punishment was reduced to six months imprisonment after forfeiting some of his loots to the government.\n\n\u201cAnother incident of plea bargaining was the case of former Governor of Bayelsa State, Dieprieye Alamiesiegha. He, too, was arrested and taken to court by the EFCC, who, after entering into negotiation with the accused, reduced the charges against him to six. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment while he refunded some amount of money into the government coffers.\n\n\u201cSimilar thing happened in the case of Lucky Igbinedon, the former Governor of Edo State, who was fined the sum of N3.5 million after he had entered into a plea bargain with EFCC to reduce the 191-count charge against him to just a single count. Though Igbinedion walked away a free man in Nigeria, he was effectively barred by the United States Government on January 12, 2013 from entering its territory henceforth.\n\n\u201cIn the case of John Yusuf, who embezzled N27.2 billion pension fund of retired police officers, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment or a fine of N750,000.00 that being the maximum punishment provided for in Section 309 of the Penal Code under which he was charged!\n\n\u201cMrs. Cecilia Ibru, the former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Oceanic Bank Plc. Mrs. Ibru was arraigned before the court by the EFCC on a 25-count charge of different charges of corruption while in office. After negotiation with the anti-corruption body, the charges against her were reduced to three.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the plea bargaining between the EFCC and Mrs. Ibru, the accused decided to plead guilty to the reduced charges of mismanagement and abuse of office. Thereafter, Kola Awodein, (SAN), who appeared for the EFCC, subsequently informed the court that the commission had reached an agreement with Mrs. Ibru and the said agreement had been filed in court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria added, \u201cOn Friday, the 8th day of October, 2010, the trial judge, Justice Dan Abutu of the Federal High Court, Lagos, delivered judegment in the matter. He sentenced the accused to six months imprisonment on each of the three counts and directed that the sentences should run concurrently. This means the convict was to spend only six months in prison.\n\n\u201cThe convict, however, forfeited N191 billion worth of properties and assets to the government, according to the judgement of the court. Among the properties so forfeited were those in Nigeria, United States of America and Dubai in United Arab Emirates, together with shares in more than 100 companies, most of them listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe judge ordered Mrs. Ibru to be taken to Reddington Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos by the prison authorities within two hours after they receive the copy of the judgement and she is to remain in the hospital until she is certified fit to stay in prison custody.\n\n\u201cThe case of FRN v. Sarah Ochepke & 2 Ors , where the Defendant along with two other accused persons were by an Amended Charge dated 9th of February, 2018 arraigned before the Federal High Court, Jos, on three counts charge of conspiracy, to accept cash payment of the sum of N450,000,000 from one Annet Olije Gyen, Head of operations, Jos branch of Fidelity Bank Plc, and did accept and retain the said amount of N450,000,000.00, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law to be paid to an individual(s).\n\n\u201cThe court sentenced the defendants Sarah Ochepke (being the former Minister of Water Resources), Raymond Dabo, and Leo Jitung, to three months imprisonment each, with an option to pay a fine of N1 million each. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 16(1) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2013 (as amended), carries a minimum term of three years imprisonment or a N10 million fine. The judge, however, exercised his discretion and sentenced them to three months imprisonment each or an option N1 million naira each.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Falana said, \u201cThe case of FRN v. Abdulrasheed Maina is one of the few that made a little difference: Maina who was charged with criminal offences, punishable under sections 11(2) (a), 15(3), and 16(2) (c) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, and also acted in breach of the Advance Fee Fraud Act, was in November, 2021, convicted and sentenced to eight years imprisonment, after being found guilty on all the 12-count charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him and his company, Common Input Property and Investment Limited.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered Maina and his firm to forfeit about N2.1 billion that was traced to their bank accounts, as well as another sum of $223, 396, 30, to the federal government, after which he directed that the company should be wound up. It also ordered the forfeiture of Maina\u2019s two choice properties at Life camp and Jabi districts of Abuja, to the government, likewise the auction of a bulletproof car and a BMW 5 Series exotic car that was found in premises of the convict.\n\n\u201cOn March 18, 2022, an Abuja Upper Area Court in the Gwagwalada area council sentenced a 19-year-old student, Hillary Yunana, to four-month imprisonment for stealing spaghetti and noodles from a shop. The convict, a resident of Bassa village, along Airport Road, Abuja, was charged with burglary and theft.\n\n\u201cThe judge, Sani Umar, jailed Yunana after he pleaded guilty to the offence. Umar, however, gave the convict an option to pay N10,000 for each of the charges, or serve a jail term of two months for each of them. He said the sentence would run concurrently and warned Yunana to desist from committing crimes in the future. The judge said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to anyone who wanted to toe the depraved path in the future.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, 2022, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, discharged and acquitted the former Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Andrew Yakubu, of the money laundering charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him.\n\n\u201cThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, held that the anti-graft agency failed to prove its case against the erstwhile NNPC boss. The court ordered that monies the EFCC seized from Yakubu, who was GMD of the NNPC between 2012 and 2014, should be returned to him.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC had on the strength of a tip-off by a whistle-blower, raided Yakubu\u2019s guest house situated at Sabon Tasha, Kaduna State in 2017 and discovered the sum of $9.7million and \u00a374,000 which he hid in a fireproof safe inside the house.\u201d\n\nFalana explained further, \u201cBetween 2005 and 2006, a panel of enquiry instituted by the federal government found that 197 defendants who were tried, convicted and jailed for drug trafficking were not found in any correctional centre in the country.\n\n\u201cAt the end of their trials, members of a syndicate made of prosecution and defence lawyers, court clerks and warders collected heavy bribes from the convicts and allowed them to escape imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was found that the convicts returned to the nefarious business. I took up the matter with the authorities of the NDLEA, who assured me that the convicts would be arrested and made to serve the prison terms. But that was the end of the story.\n\n\u201cOn July 10, 2015, the then Chief Judge of Anambra State, the Honourable Justice Umeadi, visited all prisons in the state for the purpose of jail delivery to decongest the prisons. His Lordship disclosed that some prison inmates have no records in the prisons. The scandal was well reported at the material time.\n\n\u201cSince inmates are committed to prisons by warrants issued by Judges and Magistrates, the authorities of the correctional centre are challenged to explain who authorised the \u2018imprisonment\u2019 of inmates without records.\n\n\u201cAwaiting trial inmates constitute not less than 75 per cent of the prison population in the country. Majority of the inmates, including convicts, are poor people. The few rich people and members of the ruling class that are jailed are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors in exercise of their powers under section 175 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBased on the recommendation of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Council of State has just approved the pardon of a number of convicted persons, including two former state governors that were jailed for laundering billions of naira.\n\n\u201cSince the constitution provides for equality of all citizens before the law, all other persons convicted for stealing, fraud and money laundering ought to be pardoned and freed. There can be no moral or legal justification for jailing poor people who steal spaghetti and noodles to feed their family members while those who loot the treasury are granted clemency or pardon.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, permit me to call on the poor who constitute the majority of poor victims of institutionalised criminal justice system to unite and fight for socioeconomic justice and equality before the law.\n\n\u201cIn particular, indigent accused persons are advised to brief lawyers in the Legal Aid Council and the Office of the Public Defender in every state of the federation to provide them with legal practitioner whenever they are arrested, detained or charged with any criminal offence.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the state to assign lawyers, free of charge, to citizens who earn less than the national minimum wage of N30,000.00.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law is not neutral in a class society. It is made and enacted by rich legislators to serve the interests of the rich. The judges interpret the law to favour the rich and powerful people in the society.\n\n\u201cThe big lawyers hired to defend the rich exploit loopholes and technicalities in the law to free their rich clients. Hence, the poor man who stole noodle in Abuja to feed himself, was jailed by an Upper Area Court. Even though he had no more to feed himself, the judge sentenced him to six months imprisonment or N20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cBut the former top public officer who laundered $9.8 million and \u00a374,000, has been set free by the Federal High Court. The judge blamed the EFCC for not proving the case beyond reasonable doubt!\u201d\n\nPyrates Confraternity Condemns Pardon to Nyame, Dariye\n\nThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) declared that Nyame and Dariye were undeserving of the presidential pardon.\n\nThe group said the pardon had made mockery of the anti-graft law, stressing that it is manifestly undeserving, blatantly discriminatory and distasteful.\n\nFurthermore, it said the Council of State let the nation down by not rejecting the recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy to the former governors, adding that the pardon has effectively killed the anti-graft war.\n\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr. Abiola Owoaje, in a statement titled, \u201cPresidential Pardon for Corrupt Ex-governors: Buhari\u2019s death knell for the anti-graft war,\u201d and made available to THISDAY in Yenagoa, said the intention of presidential pardon ought not to be for the likes of Nyame and Dariye.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) is extremely disappointed by the unfortunate decision of the Council of State. We are saddened that the Council, which courageously, reportedly, turned down a state pardon for former Bank PHB Managing Director, Francis Atuche, also serving jail term for corruption, could not display the same courage and reject the request to pardon Nyame and Dariye.\n\n\u201cWhatever the rationale behind acquiescing to the recommendation of the committee to pardon the two corrupt former governors before serving out their prison terms, the nation has been let down by this eminent body.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the pardon had lent justifiable credence to speculations that its intention was to shore up the battered image of the ruling party and give it a bounce ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nOwoaje pointed out that the presidential pardon was inconsistent with Sections 15(5), 17(a) and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. He added that it \u201calso miserably falls below standards, measures and rules in the United Nations Convention against corruption.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that corruption in the country predated the Buhari administration, adding, however, \u201chis numerous assurances that he would fight and defeat corruption was one of the key reasons Nigerians elected him in 2015 and re-elected him in 2019.\n\n\u201cSeven years down the line, Nigerians are still bearing with the oft repeated refrain that \u2018we must kill corruption before it kills us\u2019 as the only tangible reference to demonstrate the president\u2019s acclaimed commitment to tackle corruption.\n\n\u201cWell-meaning Nigerians had hoped that President Buhari would be able to summon the courage and salvage his administration\u2019s tepid anti-graft war. Sadly, the presidential pardon has made mockery of the war against corruption. Unequivocally, the grim implication of the presidential pardon, aside the demoralising effect it would have on anti-graft officials, is the fact that it has effectively sabotaged the war against graft.\n\n\u201cIt certainly would embolden our well- heeled citizens to engage in corruption with the belief that they can be granted pardon by their friends in government. We have previously recommended to the government steps to take to tackle corruption but the administration\u2019s latest action has shown that it is not willing to lift a finger to fight corruption. In granting state pardon to corrupt individuals, President Buhari has conferred on himself the status of the Chief Undertaker that sounded the death knell for his administrations\u2019 anti-graft war.\u201d\n\nGoddy Egene, Wale Igbintade in Lagos and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa",
          "summary": "Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, on Tuesday joined the growing number of eminent Nigerians and groups that have condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant a presidential pardon to former governors, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame.\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) on Tuesday condemned the presidential pardon granted to the two former governors convicted for corruption.\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr. Abiola Owoaje, in a statement titled, \u201cPresidential Pardon for Corrupt Ex-governors: Buhari\u2019s death knell for the anti-graft war,\u201d and made available to THISDAY in Yenagoa, said the intention of presidential pardon ought not to be for the likes of Nyame and Dariye.\nOwoaje pointed out that the presidential pardon was inconsistent with Sections 15(5), 17(a) and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\nSadly, the presidential pardon has made mockery of the war against corruption.",

          "title": "Nigeria: With Advancement in Technology, No One Can Claim Millions of Votes Again, Buhari Says",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, assured the Nigerian people that with advancement in technology by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the 2023 elections would be different and prevent individuals from claiming millions of votes at elections.\n\nBuhari, who met with governors, ministers and heads of government agencies at the State House, Abuja, over Iftar, however advised Nigerians to resist agents bent on causing breakdown of law and order, in the country, assuring them also that no individual or group would be allowed to destabilise the country.\n\nBut the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri on Tuesday, bemoaned the increasing insecurity in Nigeria and said the situation was worse than it was in 2015, when the All Progressives Congress (APC) took over power in the country.\n\nThe governor, who stated this at Government House, Yenagoa, during separate courtesy visits by new heads of some security agencies, therefore, called on the federal government to redouble its effort at combating insecurity, particularly, in the northern part of the country.\n\nThis is as some terrorists have killed three of their victims in Kaduna State, threatening to kill 22 others if a ransom of N20 million was not delivered to them before midnight Tuesday.\n\nAt the same time, three people were killed while 19 others sustained varying degrees of injuries, when an explosions rocked Iware Cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nIn similar breath, the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, has ordered a review of police personnel and operational assets deployments to schools and colleges around the country.\n\nBuhari, in a release issued by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, thanked the governors and ministers for honouring his invitation to break fast with, and expressed confidence that in spite of the current security challenges, the country would succeed.\n\nSpecifically on the 2023 elections, the president affirmed that being beneficiary of free, fair and credible elections, the introduction of technology and the Permanent Voters Card (PVCs), would make it impossible for anyone to claim millions of votes again in the country.\n\nHe however, noted that, \u201cWe have the land, we have the resources, and we have the people. But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country.\u201d\n\nChairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi,however, commended President Buhari for demonstrating resilience and determination at a crucial period in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader, who is not distracted by momentary challenges but has continued to commit to the renewal of our nation and we, governors, ministers and heads of government agencies are equally dedicated to building a better Nigeria, on your watch,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that this year\u2019s Holy month of Ramadan coincided with the just concluded Christian Lenten period, the Governor of Ekiti, said it held enormous spiritual value on the benefits of renewal, sacrifice, almsgiving, forgiveness and healing for the individual as well as the nation.\n\nOn his part, Diri, who spoke when he received the Comptroller of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Bayelsa Command, Mr Sunday James, the Bayelsa helmsman lamented the level of insecurity in the north, saying once a part of the country was in distress, other areas were also affected.\n\nHe said the spate of killings by terrorists in the country was a great setback for Nigeria, where lives could be taken at will and urged the APC-led federal government to effectively curb the killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cI use this opportunity to again call on the federal government to do something. These are the same issues that led to the APC government coming to power in 2015.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you will agree that things are worse now than in 2015. The federal government has to redouble its effort, otherwise, the joker card is with the people of Nigeria. They know what to do come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen one part of the country is sick, it affects the other parts. Kaduna and other states in the North are sick security-wise and it is affecting other parts of the country. Nigeria is very close to the Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u2018state of nature\u2019 where life is described as nasty, brutish and short. The federal government has to do something to keep us away from the Hobbesian state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, James, said the visit was to formally present himself as the new helmsman of the service in the state, and said as the agency in charge of giving clearance to intending foreign visitors, he was prepared to synergise to realise the state\u2019s investment drive.\n\nDiri equally charged the new Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral Idi Abbas, to collaborate with the state government in curbing oil theft, illegal bunkering, kidnapping and related crimes in the maritime domain of the state.\n\nHe acknowledged that having served in the Command in other capacities, Rear Admiral Abbas, would contribute significantly towards sustaining the peace and development of the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe you have distinguished and excelled in your service and will not be a pawn in the chess game of anybody or any political party.\n\n\u201cEnsure that you discharge your functions with utmost professionalism to bring about peace, security and development of Bayelsa and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cSecurity does not know ethnicity. It has no face of political parties and so, let nobody influence you and your Command on politics. We are in a political season and all kinds of characters are on display: the good, the bad and the ugly. The number one thing is to ensure safety of lives and property in our maritime domain and that is the only way we can talk about genuine development.\u201d\n\nAbbas, on his part, also said his visit was to officially present himself to the governor following his posting to head the Command on February 4 this year.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the state government for its support to the Command and appreciated it for the donation of land to build a referral hospital, adding that the secondary school allocated to the Navy would be taken over completely in no distant time.\n\nIn a related development, Diri was decorated as an ambassador against drug abuse by the state command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nThe NDLEA State Commandant, Commander Aminu Ali, conferred the honour on the governor when he led other members of the agency to formally introduce himself as the new head of the command.\n\nThree Dead, 19 Injured As Explosion Rocks Taraba Cattle Market\n\nThree people were on Tuesday killed while 19 others sustained varying degrees of injuries, when an explosions rocked Iware Cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nThe incident, which occurred around 4pm at a local drinking spot, sent the entire community in pandemonium as people ran helter-skelter for safety.\n\nThe State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview.\n\nA resident of Iware, Ismael Yakubu, also told THISDAY that the bomber came into the spot in company of another accomplice with the bomb hidden in a polythene bag and disguised as customers.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTwo guys came to the drinking spot as if they wanted to buy Burukutu and after they were served, the one holding the poly bag containing the bomb dropped his beer and the polythene bag and left.\n\n\u201cThe accomplice then said he was going to look for his friend and would come back. After he had also left, the bomb exploded and many people were injured while some others were killed.\u201d\n\nOne of the bombers was, however, apprehended and was killed by the angry mob before security operatives could arrive the scene.\n\nThe corpses of those killed had been deposited at the mortuary while those injured were receiving treatment at a health facility in Iware. Others in critical conditions had equally been moved to the Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo.\n\nIware cattle market is one of the biggest cattle markets in Taraba State and the economic hub of Ardo Kola Local Government Area, which operates every Tuesday.\n\nIG Orders Maximum Security in Schools, Colleges; Hard on Compliance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, yesterday, ordered the review of police personnel and operational assets deployments to schools and colleges around the country.\n\nThe review may not be unconnected with the incessant kidnapping of school children by bandits in the North and the killing of school pupils in isolated incidents, owing to inadequate security by the affected schools in the Southern part of the country.\n\nLagos State government had yesterday shut Chrisland School over alleged sex scandal involving a 10-year-old female pupil during a trip to Dubai.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters said the review was to ensure the protection of schools and colleges, particularly, boarding schools, tertiary institutions and its campuses in areas prone to security breaches around the country.\n\nThe statement said the IG directive was issued at a meeting of the force management team at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, while reviewing the general security in the country including the security of schools and colleges as a result of some isolated incidences reported in some schools.\n\nThe IG slso directed all Commissioners of Police in the 36 States and FCT, tactical commanders as well as their supervising Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) to explore all available options and think outside the box to boost security in and around schools, colleges and student-based communities.\n\nThe IG, therefore, directed detectives/operatives of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) and the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) to ensure sustained surveillance and intelligence gathering activities within various school environments while the Police Airwing was directed to extend its aerial patrols to the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThe IG, however, assured the people that all hands would be on deck to ensure a safe environment for all pupils and students in the various schools and colleges in the country, even as he reiterated the commitment of his administration to diversifying resources towards sustainable security and safety of the citizenry.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Wole Ayodele in Jalingo",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised Nigeria\u2019s 2022 economic growth forecast from the 2.7 per cent it had previously estimated, to 3.4 per cent.\n\nAdditionally, the fund reviewed upward the country\u2019s 2023 growth prediction, from 2.7 per cent to 3.1 per cent.\n\nThese were contained in the IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), titled: \u201cWar Sets Back the Global Recovery,\u201d that was released on the side-lines of the ongoing IMF/World Bank hybrid spring meetings in Washington DC.\n\nThe multilateral institution noted that the non-oil sector played a pivotal role in increasing Nigeria\u2019s growth prospect, noting that globally only 86 per cent of countries saw a downward revision of its growth projection. It indicated that Nigeria was amongst 14 per cent of countries that had been estimated to record growth.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s growth forecasts, Division Chief Research Department, Mr. Malhar Nabar, while responding to a THISDAY question, during a media briefing said, \u201cThe heterogeneity is a key factor, if you look at the global revisions that we have 86 per cent of the global economy revising down and Nigeria is one of the few that\u2019s actually revised up and there are two main factors: one is what you mentioned, the increased oil price, which represents a favourable terms of trade effect for Nigeria, will increase oil production and oil exports.\n\n\u201cAnd then the second factor is the strong momentum that we saw in the non-oil sector part of the economy. The non-oil sector of the economy is also showing strong momentum going into this year, which helped lift the outcome, growth forecasts that we have for Nigeria to 3.4 per cent for this year, and 3.1 per cent for next year, and that\u2019s 0.7 percentage point increase for this year and 0.4percentage point increase your next.\u201d\n\nIMF Chief Economist, Mr. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, also noted that oil price increase played a role in the upward review.\n\nGourinchas said, \u201cNigeria is an energy producer and exporter. And I think that explains a good part of the upward revision in our growth projections.\u201d\n\nHowever, IMF in the WEO noted, \u201cThe increase in oil prices has however lifted growth prospects for the region\u2019s oil exporters, such as Nigeria. Overall, growth in sub-Saharan Africa is projected at 3.8 per cent in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn sub-Saharan Africa, food prices are also the most important channel of transmission, although in slightly different ways. Wheat is a less important part of the diet, but food in general is a larger share of consumption.\n\n\u201cHigher food prices will hurt consumers\u2019 purchasing power particularly among low-income households and weigh on domestic demand. Social and political turmoil, most notably in West Africa, also weigh on the outlook.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the global economy Gourinchas said policymakers should also ensure that the global financial safety net operates effectively.\n\nAccording to him,\u201cFor some countries, this means securing adequate liquidity support to tide over short- term refinancing difficulties. But for others, comprehensive sovereign debt restructuring will be required.\n\n\u201cThe Group of Twenty\u2019s Common Framework for Debt Treatments offers guidance for such restructuring but has yet to deliver. The absence of an effective and expeditious framework is a fault line in the global financial system.\n\n\u201cParticular attention should also be paid to the overall stability of the global economic order to make sure that the multilateral framework that has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty is not dismantled.\n\n\u201cIn this difficult environment, national-level policies and multilateral efforts will play an important role. Central banks will need to adjust their policies decisively to ensure that medium- and long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. Clear communication and forward guidance on the outlook for monetary policy will be essential to minimise the risk of disruptive adjustments.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSeveral economies will need to consolidate their fiscal balances. This should not impede governments from providing well-targeted support for vulnerable populations, especially in light of high energy and food prices.\n\n\u201cEmbedding such efforts in a medium- term framework with a clear, credible path for stabilising public debt can help create room to deliver the needed support.\u201d",
          "summary": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised Nigeria\u2019s 2022 economic growth forecast from the 2.7 per cent it had previously estimated, to 3.4 per cent.\nAdditionally, the fund reviewed upward the country\u2019s 2023 growth prediction, from 2.7 per cent to 3.1 per cent.\nThe multilateral institution noted that the non-oil sector played a pivotal role in increasing Nigeria\u2019s growth prospect, noting that globally only 86 per cent of countries saw a downward revision of its growth projection.\nIt indicated that Nigeria was amongst 14 per cent of countries that had been estimated to record growth.\nSocial and political turmoil, most notably in West Africa, also weigh on the outlook.\u201dCommenting on the global economy Gourinchas said policymakers should also ensure that the global financial safety net operates effectively.",

          "text": "The number of Netflix subscribers has fallen for the first time in more than a decade.\n\nThe streaming company lost 200,000 members in the first three months of the year, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nThe declines came after the firm raised prices in key markets including the US and UK, while pulling out of Russia.\n\nBut Netflix warned that more losses are coming, and it hinted it will start to crack down on account sharing as it pushes to sign up new members.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders, Netflix said a surge in sign-ups it saw during the pandemic had \u201cobscured the picture\u201d.\n\nIt warned investors it expected another two million subscribers to leave in the three months to July.\n\n\u201cOur revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show,\u201d the company said as it released its quarterly results.\n\n\u201cOur relatively high household penetration \u2013 when including the large number of households sharing accounts \u2013 combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.\u201d\n\nThe last time the company lost members in a quarter was October 2011. It still boasts more than 220 million subscribers globally.\n\nRussian hit\n\nPulling out of Russia, a step Netflix took following the war in Ukraine, cost it 700,000 subscribers, it said.\n\nAnother 600,000 people stopped its service in the US and Canada after the price increase, Netflix said.\n\nNetflix said that move was playing out \u201cin line with expectations\u201d and would yield more money for the firm, despite the cancellations.\n\nThe firm\u2019s revenue in the first three months of the year was up 9.8% compared with the same period last year to more than $7.8bn (\u00a36bn).\n\nThat marked a slowdown from earlier quarters, while profits fell more than 6% to roughly $1.6bn.\n\nLosses in the quarter were partially offset by sign-ups elsewhere such as Japan and India.\n\nAs it looks to grow, the firm said it is focused on international markets and finding ways to tap the 100 million people it estimates are sharing household accounts, including more than 30 million in the US and Canada.\n\nThe company is looking to advertising and getting revenues from customers who share accounts with family or friends..\n\n\u201cThose who have followed Netflix know that I\u2019ve been against the complexity of advertising, and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\u201d said chief executive Reed Hastings. \u201cBut, as much as I\u2019m a fan of that, I\u2019m a bigger fan of consumer choice.\u201d\n\nMr Hastings said \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear\u201d that ad-supported services are working for Disney and HBO.\n\nBut analysts said rising costs are starting to wear on households.\n\nIn the UK, households cancelled more than 1.5 million streaming subscriptions in the first three months of the year, with 38% saying they wanted to save money \u2013 the highest level ever, according to research from market research firm Kantar.\n\nNetflix is also facing intense competition, as companies from Amazon and Apple to traditional media firms like Disney pour money into their online streaming services.\n\nPaolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said the subscriber loss was a \u201creality check\u201d for the company, as it tries to balance retaining subscribers with raising its revenue.\n\n\u201cWhile Netflix and other services were key in lockdown, users are now thinking twice about their purchasing behaviour based upon changing habits,\u201d he said.\n\nNorth America especially is \u201cnow awash with too many services chasing too few dollars\u201d, he added.\n\nShares in the company plunged more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York following the news, wiping more than $30bn off the company\u2019s market valuation.\n\nInvestor concerns also hit shares in other entertainment firms, including Disney.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nNetflix, like many tech companies, had a bumper pandemic.\n\nPeople flocked to the streaming company \u2013 it seemed like the company could do no wrong.\n\nBut several factors have now combined to give Netflix the most difficult operating environment it has faced for over a decade.\n\nFirstly it can\u2019t seem to find a way to stop people from sharing passwords which it has complained about for years.\n\nAn increase in competition from rivals like Disney+ and Apple TV has also made the streaming market extremely competitive \u2013 at a time when Netflix has increased its subscription price.\n\nThe company is blaming its decision to pull out of Russia for its negative global growth \u2013 and this is technically true.\n\nBut the company is forecasting further losses in subscribers in the next quarter too, so this isn\u2019t just about Russia.\n\nAnd with the cost of living crisis biting for many, Netflix\u2019s future, which seemed so rosy only a few months ago, now looks unsteady.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Ivory Coast\u2019s president named the governor of a regional central bank as his deputy, making him the front-runner to become the next leader of the world\u2019s biggest cocoa grower.\n\nThe appointment of Tiemoko Meyliet Kone as vice president marks the start of a race to succeed President Alassane Ouattara, 80, who will step down after serving three terms in 2025. Ouattara also reappointed Patrick Achi, 66, as prime minister, which vies with the deputy presidency as the second-most powerful position in the West African nation\u2019s government.\n\nA 73-year-old economist, Kone previously served as minister of construction in the Ivorian government, before taking up the position of governor of the Central Bank of West African States in 2016.\n\nThe position of vice president has been vacant since Daniel Kablan Duncan resigned in 2020, after he was overlooked as a potential successor to Ouattara in that year\u2019s election. Ouattara went on to win a third term in office.\n\nUnder Ivory Coast\u2019s constitution, the vice president takes over in the event the president becomes incapacitated.\n\nAchi\u2019s reappointment came a week after he stepped down to prepare for a slimmed down cabinet. Ouattara said last week he will reduce the number of ministers to \u201cstrengthen government effectiveness and bearing in mind the current world economic situation.\u201d The cabinet currently consists of 41 people.\n\n\u201cAfter today\u2019s events, succession is still an open question,\u201d said Tochi Eni-Kali, Africa analyst at the Washington-based Eurasia Group. \u201cAchi is by no means out of the race, but Kone very much fits Ouattara\u2019s ideal profile.
