          "text": "Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, will continue to pay full salaries and other workers\u2019 benefits till the end of his tenure as the state governor, Ismail Omipidan, Oyetola\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, has said.\n\nOmipidan gave the assurance while reacting to the assertion by Rev. Isaac Oluyamo, the Diocesan Bishop of Ijesa North, Anglican Communion, that Oyetola would win his re-election but that salary would cease for four years.\n\nThis was contained in a statement on Monday titled, \u2018Osun 2022: God cannot approbate and reprobate at same time, Oyetola\u2019s aide replied clergyman\u2019, and signed by Omipidan.\n\nThe media aide described the cleric assertion as one \u201clacking in sound logic\u201d, adding that the claim that the second term of governors and government is always full of turbulence showed that the clergy was only expressing his personal opinion based on logic.\n\nAccording to him, Governor Oyetola had in the last three years plus based the governance of Osun on creativity, innovation, probity, and sustainable development. These are rare governance instruments in Nigeria, especially those governments the clergyman based his logic on.\n\nOmipidan further said, \u201cAs a Government, we have a solid and foolproof template for running the economy.\n\n\u201cOyetola\u2019s government is a product of God\u2019s pronouncement and promise (Ilerioluwa). God who spoke to the Governor about the mandate cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time. God cannot give a second term and withhold the resources for running it at the same time.\n\n\u201cGod is not a liar. He has spoken and government is fulfilling its own part by responsibly putting mechanisms in place to put the economy on a sure footing.\n\n\u201cIn the unlikely event of worsening economic downturn, Osun has demonstrated enough competence to run a state in a depressed economy under Governor Oyetola.\n\n\u201cWe have proved beyond all reasonable doubts that we have the capacity to substantially fund our overheads, including salaries and infrastructure development, from cutting costs and plugging wastages, among other windows.\n\n\u201cWith a sustained culture of economic transformation through agriculture, mining, and tourism, we are poised to take our economic destiny in our own hands.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the clergyman\u2019s goodwill and understand his concern and fears, which are products of existential realities and experiences, we make bold to say that Governor Oyetola will continue to pay full salaries as long as he remains the Osun\u2019s helmsman because it is a covenant between him and God. And we believe God will never forsake him,\u201d Omipidan added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Proposed Electricity Bill: Governors write Senate, reject bill",
          "text": "Senate\n\nSay the Bill is injurious to the states with regard to generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in their domain\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nABUJA-THE thirty \u2013 Six State Governors under the aegis of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, NGF have written to the Senate on the proposed Electricity Bill, rejecting the bill vehemently in its entirety, saying that if it sails through, it will disrobe states of their constitutionally defined roles.\n\nIn a letter to the Chairman, Senate Committee on Power, Senator Gabriel Suswam, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Benue North East and copied the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan and the Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Chairman of NGF and Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi said that the Bill must be jettisoned because it is injurious to the states with regard to generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in their domain.\n\nThe Bill is expected to be presented tomorrow, Tuesday at the Senate by the former Governor of Benue State governor and now the Chairman of the Committee on Power Tuesday at the Senate.\n\nREAD ALSO:By-elections: APC wins House of Reps, PDP clinches State Assembly in C\u2019River\n\nThe letter was dated 22nd February 2022 and received on 23rd February by the Senate Committee on Power.\n\nThe Governors wonder why the Chairman Senate Committee on Power, Senator Gabriel Suswam had in an article argued that \u201cThe Electricity Bill 2022 is based on recommendations put together by a team of Consultants engaged by the Senate Committee on Power. Invariably, the Electricity Bill by the Senate Committee on Power is not a \u201ctrue and fair\u201d reflection of stakeholders in the Nigerian electricity sector, most particularly the State governments. It is also not a \u201ctrue and fair\u201d reflection of the Federal executive arm.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governors, contrary to the views of the Suswam, Clause 2(2) of the Bill is rather injurious to the constitutional rights of States with regards to electricity generation, transmission, and distribution, adding that limiting the powers of State governments to build generation plants, transmission and distribution lines only in areas not covered by the national grid, shrinks the powers of States to make laws for electricity within their state jurisdictions.\n\nThe NGF\u2019s submission details other aspects of the Electricity Bill that not only violates the constitutional rights of States, but unconstitutionally donates powers to the National Assembly and the Federal Government with respect to the supervision and regulation of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution within States.\n\nFayemi in the letter advised that it is important to engage the Federal House of Representatives on the respective bills for the electricity sector, particularly the EPSRA amendment bill 2020 and other bills, which also infringe on the constitutional rights of states to make laws for electricity, with a view to harmonizing it into a single draft electricity bill.\n\nThe letter titled, \u201d Re: The Senate Electoral Bill, read, \u201cWe write concerning a matter that has now become one requiring urgent national attention. It has come to the attention of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) that the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has before it a Bill for a law to repeal the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, 2005, consolidate various laws relating to the electricity sector and for many other matters both connected and unconnected therewith.\n\n\u201cThe following relevant information has also come to our attention: The Bill has gone through a second reading and a public hearing thereon has been scheduled for the 28th of February and 1st March 2022. A schedule of parties to be heard at these public hearings has been published by the Senate Committee on Power.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the States have no opportunity to be heard, whether individually or through the Nigeria Govemors\u2019 Forum.\n\n\u201cWe wish to point out that \u201celectricity\u201d is not an exclusive federal matter. It is guided by the provisions of the Concurrent Legislative List. Articles 13 and 14 clearly provide that the power to make laws for the generation and transmission of electricity are concurrent. Also, Article 14 reserves exclusively to the State the power to make laws for the distribution of electricity within a State as it also does the power to make laws for the generation and transmission of electricity exclusively within the borders of a State.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to note that the National Electric Power Policy, 2001, the only extant Federal Government general policy statement on the electricity sector, in Chapter Three, is very clear that the States and State Governments are key stakeholders in the electricity value chain.\n\n\u201cWe recall that past efforts of States to establish and sustain electricity markets of their own have been stifled by the Federal Government. The efforts of Lagos and Rivers States are notable examples. Historically, the extension of electricity services beyond State capitals in the first 12 States of Nigeria was driven by the State Governments through their State electrification or rural electrification boards.\n\n\u201cThis has continued with the 36 States and it is now established by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission and accepted by the National Council on Privatisation that an average of 30% of the historical investment into the electricity distribution networks were made directly by the States. Most of this value is situated in the rural areas of the 36 States.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the reality of the States as key partners in the achievement of universal electricity access by all Nigerians must not only be accepted by the Federal Government but must be legislated by the National Assembly. States like Lagos, Edo Ekiti, Ondo and Kaduna have already taken the initiative to enact policy statements and laws for the electricity sectors in their States. Similarly, the 19 States of Northern Nigeria have come together to establish a common platform for realising the benefits of the extensive renewable energy resources that their region is blessed with.\n\n\u201cIt would be unconstitutional and an unjustifiable act of overreach for the Senate to consider and pass a Bill that continues to treat the Federation as one single electricity jurisdiction or sector. While a single Electric Power Sector Reform Act may have been useful as a catalyst for the sector in the early years of the Fourth Republic, the States have all come of age, literally and metaphorically, and the arrangements must change in a way that accepts and respects the maturity of the States in electricity matters; a reality that this Senate Electricity Bill does not recognise and take account of but at best only pays the most cursory lip service.\n\n\u201cAfter 71 years of sole and unchallenged central control of the electricity sector, we live with an electricity sector divided into two parts, One part is the FG-controlled and -regulated national electricity market that today is insolvent, bankrupt and delivers no more than approximately 4,000MW/96,000MWh daily to 220m Nigerians, or an average of 18w/432watt-hours daily, barely enough to power two (2) 10-watt light bulbs a day. The other part of Nigeria\u2019s electricity sector is the alternative/back-up market, whose estimated capacity is approximately 40,000MWso much so that Nigerian citizens are their own electricity providers in their homes, factories, schools, hospitals and places of worship.\n\n\u201cOur calculations indicate that if the 40,000MW of electrical back-up capacity owned and operated by Nigerians were to be delivered to them by licensed private IPPs and distribution companies through organised public electricity markets, Nigerian citizens and governments would have saved up to =N=17trn in 2021. Instead, this much money was bumt up via diesel and petrol generator operating/maintenance costs, instead of being saved and invested by private citizens and businesses and some of it captured by the States and Federal Government as tax revenues and levies.\n\n\u201cThis has been the norm for decades and has worsened each year even as it seems set to continue in 2022 and beyond. Unfortunately, the reform and privatisation programme that was started in 2001 with the National Electric Power Policy, expanded in 2005 with the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, recharged in 2010 with the Roadmap to Power Sector Reform and consolidated in 2013 via the privatisation of the generation and distribution has come to a most regrettable halt with a privatised FG-controlled market that has remained incapable of meeting national aspiration since 2013.\n\n\u201cToday, the Nigerian electricity sector is insolvent and has been dependent on the Central Bank of Nigeria and Direct Foreign Investments for regular infusions of cash to keep it afloat since 2013, building up liabilities that now stand at over trillion. It is not clear how the Nigerian electricity sector can settle these liabilities and the Electricity Bill does not offer a way forward on the issue. In 2020, the National Economic Council (NEC) conducted a thorough analysis of the entire sector since the 2013 privatisation. The ensuing NEC Report established that the sector is in dire crisis and the privatised national electricity market has not tumed out as planned for various reasons, including: Incorrect assumptions made by the Federal Government pre-privatisation; Lack of adequate due diligence by bidders for available electricity assets; Failure to set economic tariffs; Non-compliance with commercial contracts and NERC regulations; Absence of effective power purchase agreements thus encouraging load rejection by\n\nDiscos; Misaligned and poorly-timed infrastructure investments by the Federal Ministry of Power, TCN, REA, etc often without consultations with Discos and/or State Government.\n\n\u201cThe NEC Report went on to make three key recollections aimed at tackling these identified challenges and placing the national electricity market on the right footing: Return to a contract- and rules-based that promotes the orderly evolution of the sector under Market Rules and implement the EPSRA that enable different tariff methodologies to be applied to the peculiar characteristics in States;bShareholders (FGj core investors other private sector capital providers) must recapitalize the Discos and bring in both new capital and ownership/management; Implement effective governance at both governmental (policy and regulation) and private sector (board and management) levels.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, two years later none of these recommendations has been implemented and the sector is even more imperiled than ever before. For the first time since 2013, the Federal Government is implementing the obligation of the Discos to pay up on their bills 100% and the Discos cannot cope. Instead, in order to avoid paying on bills the phenomenon of load rejection, whereby Discos refuses to receive energy for delivery to customers, has become far worse and more widespread than ever.\n\n\u201cIt is in these circumstances that the Senate now has before it an Electricity Bill that does not address any of the challenges that threaten the sector and the nation. Rather, its key characteristics are a failure to recognise and provide for the rights of States to have their own electricity markets. The re-establishment of the same single national electricity market that has brought neither growth in capacity nor socio-economic development to the nation; and, as stated earlier, the continued absence of a clear path for the market to exit permanently from its long-running insolvent status. The Bill also re-establishes the existing Federal Government entities and a number of other new ones as key players in the sector.\n\n\u201cFinally, perhaps the most egregious feature that runs throughout the Bill is the establishment of a single Federal Govemment appointee, the Minister of Power, as the de facto head and statutory supervisor of all the key FG electricity sector MDAs, including the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), in a supposedly privatised electricity sector. Interestingly, the Ministers extensive powers over the sector are shared with the National Assembly through the mechanism of legislative oversight responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum does not support this Electricity Bill in the version currently before the Senate, except these amendments are reflected. This is because it is unconstitutional and maintains the policy of Federal Government overreach in the electricity sector that has not yielded development to the country. We state in very clear terms that this Electricity Bill is not a solution to the pressing challenges summarised above. It is also premature in that it does not follow from a comprehensive national dialogue on a completely revised national electricity policy. We doubt that a private member\u2019s Bill such as this can deal with such a complex national security issue without the benefit of extensive research, analysis and prior consultation before a comprehensive Bill is drafted.\n\n\u201cWe strongly recommend the constitution of a Working Group, spearheaded by the State Governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council (NEC), to work with the NASS leadership on the way forward for the electricity sector. From this should emerge a new National Electricity Policy and the foundations of a new Act of the National Assembly that, for the first time, will have the full buy-in of the States. Electricity is a vital matter of national security that, by virtue of the 1999 Constitution, is in the concurrent list and should, therefore, be made into law only with the collaboration and concurrence of the States of the Federation.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to close collaboration between the NGF, the National Assembly and the Federal Executive Branch in charting a new and productive path towards bringing energy security to our country.\u201d",

The total registered voters across the 11 existing electoral wards in the area was 94,060, and the total number of accredited voters was 18, 083. Polling commenced as early as 8:30a.m and ended at about 2:30 p.m. All accredited voters with Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) cast their votes.\n\n\u201cThe election results were published, displayed and transmitted electronically using the forms EC60E and EC8A through the INEC\u2019s portal. The number of total votes cast was 17, 862 and the total number of valid votes was 17, 280 with rejected votes being 582.\n\n\u201cNo fewer than eleven registered political parties participated in the election. The parties included: the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); All Progressives Congress (APC); All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA); the African Democratic Congress (ADC); and Labour Party (LP).\n\n\u201cOthers were the Young Progressives Party (YPP); Zenith Labour Party (ZLP); National Rescue Movement (NRM); New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP); Allied People\u2019s Movement (APM); Action Democratic Party (ADP) ; and the Social Democratic Party (SDP),\u201d he said.\n\nReacting, the state chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Imo State chapter, Charles Ugwu, has called for \u201cOutright cancellation of the Saturday, February 26, 2022 bye-election in Ngor Okpala as any outcome from such a barbaric invasion and warfare will only reflect the manipulations of Hope Uzodimma and his band of electoral fraudsters and not the will of Ngor Okpala people.\n\n\u201cWe call on INEC to order an immediate recount of all the materials and votes and reconcile them with the BVAS data. We further call on INEC to direct its HOD Ops, Fidelis Uguru to ensure the security and safety of all the materials and data deployed in the Ngor Okpala bye-election to ensure a thorough recount as any story of the loss of material or destruction of materials will prove ongoing suspicions of compromise by the commission.\n\n\u201cWe call on INEC to take steps to immediately move for the arrest and prosecution of all those implicated in this heist as contained in the Electoral Act and save our democracy both within and outside the state. This election is seriously compromised in every detail. We reiterate our call for a total cancellation.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Who dares to stand with Putin?",
          "text": "SIR: Unpopular positions usually attract popular opprobrium. Yet, following mainstream narratives has failed miserably in solving the hydra-headed problems of man.\n\nWe live in a world that thrives on hypocrisy and sentimental cynicism. What\u2019s sauce for the goose is usually not sauce for the gander. Double standard!\n\nI entered upon a gathering of fellow young men discussing and decrying the \u201cattempted annexation of Ukraine by Russia\u201d. The interlocutors typified the ordinary man who jumps into uninformed conclusions without making the littlest effort to understand the facts of the matter. Quite a huge number of people are unaware that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of the current Russian offensive against Ukraine has nothing to do with annexation, but checkmating the machinations of one\u2019s enemies before they are hatched.\n\nRussian President, Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence officer who has shepherded the country in the last 23 years, with a brief interruption between 2008 and 2012, has made it clear to the world that he does not want NATO to draw an inch closer to the east, as per earlier agreements reached. But NATO seeks to surreptitiously establish a military base at a strategic proximity to Russia by co-opting Ukraine into its fold.\n\nIt will be foolish, indeed naive, for Putin to merely look on, while the NATO forces build up around his country\u2019s borders. Astute and resolute leaders must be able to take tough, decisive, and unpopular decisions in the overall and long-term interest of their people, and that is exactly what the Russian skipper, Vladimir Putin, is doing at the moment. If my neighbour lends his territory to my enemy to use as a spy centre or a launch pad, he becomes the enemy. It is as simple as understanding that the friend of my enemy is my enemy. Know this and you will understand the political conundrum between Russia and the western coalition represented by NATO.\n\nNo sane country compromises on national security. No sane country discountenances threats from neighbours or any organization or entity. The US and her allies imposed very tough sanctions on Huawei, depriving them of such important technologies as 5G connectivity and Google services, in order to asphyxiate the Chinese telecoms giants, citing security reasons, as they accused Huawei of espionage. The punishment was escalated in September 2020 with a blanket ban that effectively cut off Huawei\u2019s chip supplies, dealing a major blow to its core smartphone business that had been highly reliant on advanced chips made with US technologies. These sanctions cost Huawei an annual revenue loss of US$30 billion in its smartphone business alone. But the world looked the other way.\n\nEssentially, what Russia is doing in Ukraine is no different from what Israel is doing in Palestine and what Saudi Arabia is doing in Yemen. So why make fish of one and meat of the other? Why aren\u2019t we seeing the emergency commentators and human rights vuvuzelas clamour for sanctions against Israel and Saudi Arabia?\n\nThe likes of Russia are needed to balance world power. Indeed, if power is left in the hands of the US and their despotic allies alone, humanity will suffer.\n\nCountries like Iran and Kuwait would have since been invaded by the US if not for repeated vetoes from Russia and China, being permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, a privilege which gives them automatic veto powers.\n\nIn the last 30 years, the US has invaded more sovereign nations than any other country in the world. From pursuing Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, to nuclear weapon hoax in Iraq, to regime change in Libya and Syria, it seems to have reserved the right to military interventions and takeovers. The country has perfected the act of euphemizing their atrocious imperialism, while it criminalizes every other entity that takes similar actions to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe generalissimo in Russia sees a wildfire, indeed a huge conflagration, brewing, and decides that the best time to quench a fire is at the incipient stage, lest it spirals out of control like the Nigerian government allowed Boko Haram to fester. This is not a war between Russia and Ukraine. It is a proxy war between Russia and the US, masquerading as NATO. It is only unfortunate that when two elephants fight, the grass suffers.\n\nLike the popular maxim says, if you want peace, prepare for war. The world will know no peace if we continue to operate different standards for different people. Only equal rights and justice can guarantee us the desired peace and stability.\n\nAbu Bilaal Abdulrazaq bn Bello bn Oare\n\nKaduna.",

          "text": "The national body of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has queried the Lagos State Council Chairman, Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (aka MC Oluomo), over alleged insubordination and indulging in anti-union activities\n\nThe letter dated February 14 by the General Secretary of the union, Alhaji Kabiru Ado Yau, accused Akinsanya of refusing to carry out directives given to him in by the national body.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the fact that despite the National Secretariat\u2019s directives during a meeting with you and other members of the Lagos State Administrative Council (SAC) in Abuja on February 9, pertaining the appointment of Alhaji Azeez Abiola as chairman, Lagos State NURTW Tricycle Operators, you have refused to comply. Instead, you have resorted to intimidation and assault on the newly appointed tricycle chairman.\u201d\n\nThe National body added that Akinsanya refused to hand over the former NURTW Secretariat situated at Abule Egba to the tricycle caretaker committee in a bid to prevent them from using the office.\n\nAkinsanya was also accused by the National body of using thugs to forcefully take over branches of his perceived enemies.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that you mobilised thugs to forcefully take over the operations of some local branches headed by perceived opponents. To avoid the wrath of the union, the national headquarters, directed M C Oluomo to within 48 hours hand over the former state council secretariat at Abule Egba to the newly appointed Lagos state Tricycle Committee; withdraw all those men you sent to take over the branches of your perceived opponents and submit a written apology to the national secretariat.\n\n\u201cFailure to comply with the foregoing directives will leave the National Secretariat with no option other than to take disciplinary action against you in line with the provisions of the union\u2019s constitution,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nSpeaking with The Nation, Akinsanya said the letter got to his office on Friday (February 25) as against February 14.\n\n\u201cI was not around when the letter was delivered on Friday. I will be in office tomorrow to look at the content and respond appropriately. I will also avail you (The Nation) my response. Thank you,\u201dAkinsanya told The Nation.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Jide Orintunsin (Abuja) and Toba Adedeji (Osogbo)\n\nThe Appeal Committee raised by the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the Osun State governorship primary has explained why it threw out the petition of an aspirant, Moshood Adeoti against the choice of Governor Gboyega Oyetola as the candidate for July 16 election.\n\nAccording to the panel said Adeoti, a former Secretary to the Osun State Government (SSG) the preferred choice of Internal Affairs Minister Rauf Aregbesola, did not furnish the committee with any particular(s) on any of the issues raised in his petition.\n\nThe panel said no member of the party was disenfranchised before and during the voting exercise.\n\nThe verdict of the committee was contained in a report signed by Ex-Governor Saad Birnin-Kudu (Chairman); Rt. Hon. Suraju Adekunbi; Sen. Binta Masi Garba; Rt. Hon. Eugene Odo; and Mr. Bayo Aina.\n\nAfter submitting his report of the Osun State Governorship Primary Election Committee to the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), last Thursday, Chairman and Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq said that the party and the administration of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola \u201care alive, strong and popular.\u201d\n\nHe based his judgement on the massive and peaceful voter turnout at the February 19 direct primary in which Oyetola emerged victorious.\n\nThe appeal panel report said: \u201cThe Appeal Committee received only one petition from Alh. Moshood Adeoti on the 22nd of February, 2022, through his lawyer, Aderemi Blessing and Co.\n\n\u201cThe committee extensively deliberated on the petition and identified key issues as follows:\n\nNon-accreditation of voters in many of the wards in the state.\n\nDisenfranchisement of eligible voters.\n\nNon-availability of result sheets in various wards across the state.\n\nVote allocation in favour of one of the contestants (Governor Gboyega Oyetola).\n\nRecruitment of the governor\u2019s loyalists as electoral officers for the elections.\n\nGeneral harassment and intimidation of voters.\n\n\u201cThe Appeal Committee invited the following monitoring field officers who supervised the primary election in some local government areas in the state: Ahmed Temitope Oyewole; Adedapo Babatunde; and Ashonibare Temitope T.\n\n\u201cAll of them testified to the fact that the election was conducted in accordance with the party guidelines in a peaceful atmosphere and even where the names of voters did not appear on the register, they were allowed to vote on the presentation of their membership card/ slip as earlier agreed by all the stakeholders in the state.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Appeal Committee found out as follows: That the petitioner did not furnish the committee with any particular(s) on any of the issues he raised in the petition.\n\n\u201cThe election was generally peaceful in all the wards of the state, except in Iwo Ward 12, Atakumosa East Ward 6, Ifelodun Ward 10 and Ifelodun Ward 11 that were canceled.\n\n\u201cThat no member of the party was disenfranchised before and during the voting exercise; that the result sheets were made available in all the wards in the state.\n\n\u201cThat the allegation of arbitrary allocations of votes in favour of any contestants was not established. There was no evidence that the governor or any other contestants loyalists.\n\n\u201cThere was no report to any security agencies or investigation made on account of harassment and intimidation of voters in the Osun State primary elections.\u201d\n\nDismissing the petition the report added: \u201cThe committee, having deliberated extensively on the petition, is of the view that it lacks merit.\u201d\n\nBut Adeoti\u2019s ally, Abiodun Agboola, debunked the dismissal of their petition. He claimed that the appeal panel was yet to sit of the petition which was filed on February 22.\n\nAgboola stated that Adeoti\u2019s lawyers were at the National Secretariat of the APC on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (last week) to know and meet the Appeal Committee.\n\nHe claimed: \u201cThey were told that the National Secretariat was yet to constitute the committee and up till now, we are not aware of any Appeal Committee on the Osun APC governorship primary.\n\n\u201cWe are however surprised to read the junks, or better put, rumour, on social media that the Appeal Committee had sat and dismissed Alhaji Adeoti\u2019s petition. We urge the general public to disregard such rumour.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, the Appeal Committee is yet to be constituted, because Adeoti or his lawyers were never informed of any, nor invited to appear before any to defend the petition against the sham called an election.\n\n\u201cIt will be an act of impunity and total disregard to democratic process if truly the Appeal Committee had sat and dismissed Adeoti\u2019s appeal without due process.\n\n\u201cWe are still waiting for official information from the national secretariat on our party on the Appeal Committee. As far as we are concerned, the purported dismissal of Adeoti\u2019s petition is still a rumour.\u201d\n\nAbdulRazaq, whose committee supervised the APC primary on February 19, said: \u201cI must report back to the party that the APC is alive and strong in Osun. The governor is doing well and the party is doing exceedingly well.\n\n\u201cAregbesola has done well and Oyetola has built on it magnificently. The infrastructures are superb. We saw bridges being constructed, schools, human capital development.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, I made enquiries on the FAAC allocations. There used to be a deduction of about an N2.4 billion monthly. That has reduced as well, slightly over N1 billion monthly. Another N70 billion has been repaid in loans by the state government.\n\n\u201cSo, the state is on a right track and it showed in the outcome of the primary that the government is in touch with the people. I urge Nigerians to visit Osun State. It is arguably the most peaceful state in Nigeria, of course after Kwara state.\u201d\n\nOn the shadow election, the Kwara helmsman said: \u201cWe are glad that we were able to deliver a credible election in which all the stakeholders and people of Osun are happy about.\u201d\n\nThe CECPC National Secretary, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, received the report on behalf of the CECPC Chairman, Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe current crisis between Russia and Ukraine is set to have a debilitating effect on the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry with analysts predicting that should the tension not doused, oil price could hit $150 per barrel.\n\nThe implication of rising oil prices, according to industry observers, will lead to an increase in the already N3 trillion budget of fuel subsidy in 2022 while many oil and gas projects that depend largely on iron and steel imports from Ukraine and Russia may suffer delay.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nMeasures forcing Russia to supply less crude or natural gas would have \u201csubstantial implications\u201d on oil prices and Nigeria\u2019s economy, said Sue Trinh of Manulife Investment Management.\n\nAlready, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has distorted global financial and energy markets causing oil prices to soar above $100 per barrel, the highest since 2014.\n\nNigeria\u2019s receipt from oil accounts for about 90 per cent of its earnings, hence a distortion in the global oil market affects the country.\n\nLast week, amid heightened tensions between the two countries, the international oil benchmark, Brent crude, rose to $103.43 per barrel\n\nBrent crude, against which Nigeria\u2019s oil is priced, hit a fresh eight-year high of $103.43 per barrel as of 4:39pm Nigerian time, last Thursday as Russian forces made their way into Ukraine in a show of force not seen in Europe since World War II in a multi-pronged attack.\n\nThe $103.43 per barrel oil price, traded above $40, a figure which is higher than the Federal Government\u2019s oil benchmark price of $62 per barrel for the 2022 budget and oil production of 1.88 million barrels per day.\n\nRegrettably, most of the gains recorded during a higher oil price regime are frittered away through refined fuel importation as Nigeria imports 100 per cent of its petroleum products needs due to the dysfunctional state of its four refineries located in Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna. Crude oil prices were on the rise on Thursday morning as Russia engaged in a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine. The price of Brent crude oil is now well over $105 per barrel for the first time since July 2014.\n\nAccording to the United Nations COMTRADE, Nigeria imports from Ukraine was $156 million in 2020 as Ukraine\u2019s major exports to Nigeria were iron and steel at $125million, sugars and sugar confectionery at $8.1million and pharmaceutical products at $7.6million.\n\nOn the other hand, mutual diplomatic relations have been in existence between Russia and Nigeria since the 1960s. In September 2021, the Russian government said its trade volume with Nigeria stood at $600million because Russia is also an oil producing nation.\n\nFollowing the battle between both countries, a publication by MMS Plus said there are reports of merchant shipping vessels in the region damaged by shelling and projectiles. At least, three vessels have been affected by gunfire in the Black Sea area off the coast of Odessa and Yuzhny. Commercial vessels have been asked not to enter the Sea of Azov as access is denied by Russian military forces. Two Russian commercial cargo ships were hit by Ukranian missiles in the Sea of Azov\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nMultiple international container lines such as MSC, Maersk and CMA CGM have released operational updates announcing suspensions of vessel calls to Ukraine until further notice.\n\nThe Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI) has issued a Ship Security Advisory admonishing commercial vessels to avoid any transit or operation within the EEZ of Ukraine or Russia within the Black Sea.\n\n\u201cAccess to the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait is currently blocked by Russian forces. All Ukrainian ports have been closed by the Ukrainian military. If a vessel is located at a Ukrainian port, plans to depart should be arranged as soon as safely possible. Access to the northwest Black Sea, north of 45\u00b0 21\u2032 is restricted by the Russian Navy.\u201d\n\n\u201cVessels must ensure the automatic identification system (AIS) is always transmitting (except when the master believes that continuing to operate AIS might compromise the safety or security of the ship or when a security incident is imminent), consistent with provisions of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and monitor VHF Channel 16. Any vessels challenged by Russian military vessels should comply fully with instructions. Armed security personnel are not to be embarked while operating in the Black Sea,\u201d it said.\n\nIt further included a report of a Marshall Islands registered bulk carrier suffering significant damage to the deck and bridge area whilst drifting approximately 50 nautical miles (nm) South of Odessa. Pending further investigation, the damage is initially thought to be caused by a projectile.\n\nCommenting on the development, Partner, Bloomfield Law Practice, Dr. Ayodele Oni, said global oil prices could rise as high as $150 a barrel if the tension between Russia and Ukraine worsens, and this will have huge economic implications for Nigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country as we should generate much more income from our oil than the benchmark in the budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are already surpassing the budgetary figures. The problem is whether the importation of finished products could erode the additional profitability as cost of bringing in finished products like PMS too would rise.\n\nWith the likely increase in the prices of refined petroleum products, subsidy and cost of subsidy may also increase- a negative implication for Nigeria,\u2019\u2019.\n\nOni pointed out that the crisis could equally signal delay cost overruns for the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas(NLNG) Train 7 as the country imports most of its iron and steel from Ukraine.\n\nFormer Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr.Muda Yusuf, observed that a lot of Nigeria\u2019s steel products come from Ukraine and Russia, saying the war is going to affect our trade with these nations.\n\n\u2018\u2018More importantly, this crisis has led to an increase in crude oil price. Nigeria should be smiling at this increase but the nation isn\u2019t refining locally, so our import bill on petroleum imports will increase. The nation\u2019s bill for fuel subsidy will also increase. If this war prolongs, the problems will lead to fiscal deficits and eventually lead to more borrowing as the debt profile will increase. We can also expect inflation because the increase in energy price, aviation fuel, diesel and Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) will be higher.\u201d\n\nNigeria can always buy oil and steel from other nations but Russia is a major oil producer in the world. Oil is a global commodity and any disruption affects the world,\u2019\u2019.",

          "title": "Ukraine crisis: Nigeria may lose petro-dollar windfall from crude price \u2013Expert warns",
          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nAs crude price surged to a new high of over $103 per barrel last week, amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war; Western sanctions barring Russian banks & companies\u2019 access to U.S. dollars and British pound Sterling, there is palpable fear that Nigeria may not benefit from the multi-billion petro-dollar accruals from the price volatility.\n\nAccording to Professor Keneth Ife, faculty member at NDA and CBN Programmes facilitator, whatever Nigeria may stand to gain from the current global tension, in terms of windfall, may either go up in flames or go down the drain in the hand of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nAbout $12.4 billion oil windfall accrued to the country during the Gulf War in 1991 as international oil price flared to an unprecedented levels.\n\nGiving reasons for his fear, Ife said: \u201cThe price of Brent crude has jumped above $100 now to about $103 per barrel. So the more tension now, the more the price of crude oil is going up. And Nigeria can not enjoy the windfall because NNPC is doing crude swap arrangement with all these countries refining for us; they will send crude oil directly to all these international companies refining for us and then take PMS back. So we are not getting the $3billion every month they say NNPC was selling. If we are getting that money for the whole of 2021, there would have been a lot of Dollars around to calm down the exchange rate. But NNPC cornered all that. So if it increases now, we wont see it. They would now tell us that the subsidy has gone up to N10billion.They just resort to burning the money that comes from that crude. So it (crude price) will be rising and we will be in pain.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOn the waves of sanctions that hit Russia from the Western world in the wake of Ukraine invasion, Ife ruled out the possibility of negatively impacting Nigeria. He reasoned that Nigeria, being a non-aligned nation, does not hold Russian currency in reserves; nor does Russia buy oil from us. They are exporter of oil just like we are exporting.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAt bi-lateral level, there is nothing to worry about. The people that are really warning about this war are members of NATO. NATO are the ones taking these sanctions against Russia. And, of course, led by America. They are the ones applying sanctions. If there are any reactions by Russia, they are targeted at those countries that are closing down their contracts and revoking landing rights of their airlines and those stuffs. I think Nigeria has not got that stage yet. What may happen is that if Nigeria has projects that Russia is committed to, and if the projects are going to be funded through a dollar-dominated loan, then that loans would face some challenges. But Nigeria\u2019s central bank may decide to do a currency swap arrangement with Russia and we would start trading between ourselves without bringing Dollars into it, just like we are doing with China by bypassing dollar.\n\n\u201cBut if Nigeria does what Ghana is doing by openly condemn Russia, it would just put the arrangement between Nigeria and Russia in the cooler. And they will get back at us at the United Nations. And, again, we will be watching how the African Union would vote when the Russia-Ukraine matter comes up at the AU. And we are not holding Russia currency in reserves; they are not buying oil from us. They are exporter of oil just like we are exporting.\u201d",

The ban applies from February 27, 2022, 3pm It is initially valid for three months.\u201d\n\nThe ministry added that humanitarian aid flights were exempt from the ban.\n\nThe Italian government said on Twitter that it was closing its airspace to Russian aircraft on Sunday, following a similar action.\n\n\u201c#Ukraine \u2013 Italy has decided to close its airspace to Russia, starting from 15.00 today,\u201d the statement said.\n\nFrance also said it would shut \u201cits airspace to Russian aircraft and airplanes from this evening onwards,\u201d according France\u2019s Transport Minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, in a tweet yesterday.\n\nDjebbari said, \u201cTo the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Europe responds with total unity.\n\n\u201cFrance is shutting its airspace to all Russian aircraft and airlines from this evening on.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany would allocate \u20ac100 billion for its armed forces as it looks to increase defense spending in the light of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that we need to invest more in the security of our country in order to protect our freedom and democracy,\u201d Scholz said while delivering a statement on Ukraine at a special parliament session.\u201d\n\nScholz said the German army needed to have \u201cnew strong competences,\u201d including better devices and equipment which \u201ccost a lot of money.\u201d He announced the \u20ac100 billion special fund for this purpose as part of the 2022 budget.\n\nHe added that the country would invest more than two per cent of its Gross Domestic Products (GDP) in defense every year from now on, and accused Putin of wanting to have a Russian empire and to change Europe.\n\nScholz said, \u201cThose who read Putin\u2019s explanation about history, those who have seen him how he announced the war on TV, and before that I had talked to him for hours, so I cannot have any doubt that he wants to have a Russian empire. He wants to change Europe according to his imagination.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the United States\u2019 Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, announced that the US was sending nearly $54 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine to assist those affected by Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, Blinken said the funds would go to international humanitarian organisations to provide food, water, shelter and health care to Ukrainians in need and help reunify families who have been separated amid Russia\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe United States commends the hospitality of the neighbouring countries in the region hosting fleeing Ukrainians, and we are engaging diplomatically to support their efforts to keep their borders open and assist those seeking international protection\n\n\u201cAs with any refugee situation, we call on the international community to respond to the needs of those seeking protection in a way consistent with the principle of non-refoulement and our shared obligations under international law.\u201d\n\nThe US has provided nearly $405 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, according to the press release.\n\nBP to Exit 19.75% Shareholding in Rosneft\n\nThe BP board announced that it would exit its shareholding in Rosneft. BP had held a 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft since 2013.\n\nThe company, in a statement on its website, also disclosed that its chief executive officer, Bernard Looney, was resigning from the board of Rosneft with immediate effect.\n\nThe other Rosneft director nominated by BP, former BP group, chief executive Bob Dudley, similarly would resign from the board. The resignations would require BP to change its accounting treatment of its Rosneft shareholding and, as a result, it expects to report a material non-cash charge with its first quarter 2022 results, to be reported in May.\n\nBP chair Helge Lund said, \u201cRussia\u2019s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression, which is having tragic consequences across the region. BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues.\n\n\u201cHowever, this military action represents a fundamental change. It has led the BP board to conclude, after a thorough process, that our involvement with Rosneft, a state-owned enterprise, simply cannot continue. We can no longer support BP representatives holding a role on the Rosneft board.\n\n\u201cThe Rosneft holding is no longer aligned with BP\u2019s business and strategy and it is now the board\u2019s decision to exit BP\u2019s shareholding in Rosneft. The bp board believes these decisions are in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders.\u201d\n\nLooney added, \u201cLike so many, I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to everyone affected. It has caused us to fundamentally rethink BP\u2019s position with Rosneft.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do, but are also in the long-term interests of BP. Our immediate priority is caring for our great people in the region and we will do our utmost to support them. We are also looking at how BP can support the wider humanitarian effort.\u201d\n\nLooney had been a director of Rosneft, as one of two BP-nominated directors since 2020. Bob Dudley had been a director of Rosneft since 2013.\n\nAs a result of the resignations of BP\u2019s nominated directors, BP determined it no longer met the criteria set out under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for having \u201csignificant influence\u201d over Rosneft. BP will, therefore, no longer hold equity account for its interest in Rosneft, treating it now as a financial asset measured at fair value.\n\nAs BP now is exiting its interest in Rosneft, it has removed Rosneft dividend payments from its financial frame. BP also disclosed that it would exit its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia.\n\nFG Secures Exit Routes for Fleeing Nigerians\n\nThe Nigerian government secured exit routes for Nigerians fleeing Ukraine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed.\n\nThe ministry in a signed statement by its permanent secretary, Ambassador Gabriel Aduda, yesterday, said visa free passage had been secured for Nigerians fleeing the troubled country.\n\nAduda advised that Nigerians fleeing Ukraine should make the move through Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County and Maramures.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fully abreast of all the challenges Nigerians crossing into countries bordering Ukraine, especially the Polish border, are facing and we are taking adequate measures to assuage these challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken with his counterpart, the Foreign Minister of Ukraine on these unsavoury development and both are working on alleviating the suffering of Nigerians, including deploying the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to the border to ensure easier access to all Nigerians and other nationals.\n\n\u201cFor now, movement to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County and Maramures borders is advised, as they have approved visa free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine and arrangements for accommodation and feeding before evacuation is arranged.\u201d\n\nAduda said, \u201cParents, guardians and wards of Nigerians in Ukraine are enjoined to remain calm as the Federal Government of Nigeria is working very hard to get them all home safely.\u201d\n\nRussians Rush for Dollars as Sanctions Threaten Ruble Collapse\n\nRussians are lining up at cash machines around the country to withdraw foreign currency as new sanctions to punish the Kremlin for its invasion of Ukraine sparked fear the ruble could collapse.\n\nThe rush for foreign currency came despite some lenders selling dollars at more than a third higher than the market\u2019s close on Friday, and well past the psychologically important level of 100 rubles per dollar that many economists said would trigger an interest-rate hike by the Bank of Russia.\n\nThe shock came as Russians were still digesting news that Europe was closing its airspace to them and popular payment systems like ApplePay would stop working, Bloomberg news reported.\n\nFIFA bans matches in Russia, 3 European countries refusing to play country in World Cup qualifiers\n\nMeanwhile, FIFA said no international football matches will be played in Russia and the country\u2019s flag and anthem will be prohibited from matches abroad. The governing body FIFA announced this in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt said Russia\u2019s national teams would henceforth compete only as the Football Union of Russia (RFU), and its games would be held with no fans and on \u201cneutral territory\u201d.\n\nThe ban came after Sweden, Poland, and the Czech Republic refused to play Russia in the 2022 World Cup playoffs next month amid the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision by the three countries could disrupt the UEFA World Cup qualifiers, and leave FIFA president Gianni Infantino with the responsibility to find a solution within the next month.\n\nSweden and Poland made the decision on Saturday, and the Czech Republic followed Sunday.\n\nUS Hypocritical about Russia-Ukraine War, Says Senator Sanders\n\nDemocratic and ranking Senator Bernie Sanders slammed the United States as hypocritical for kicking against Russia\u2019s on-going onslaught against Ukraine, accusing the American government of illegitimately overthrowing a \u201cdozen\u201d of regimes in other countries.\n\nIn a video seen by THISDAY, Sanders, who spoke before the war between Russia and Ukraine broke out, pointed out on the US Senate floor that the American government was selfish and would have flexed its military muscles against Ukraine, were it to be in Russia\u2019s situation.\n\nSanders stated, \u201cPutin may be a liar and a demagogue, but it is hypocritical for the United States to insist that we do not accept the principle of \u2018spheres of influence\u2019. For the last 200 years, our country has operated under the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the premise that as the dominant power in the western hemisphere,\u201d explained Sanders, \u201cthe United States has the right to intervene against any country that might threaten our alleged interests.\u201d\n\nUnder this doctrine, noted the US senator, America had committed various atrocities on foreign lands.\n\nThe Democratic senator stressed, \u201cWe have undermined and overthrown at least a dozen governments. In 1962 we came to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union in response to the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from our shore, which the Kennedy administration saw as an unacceptable threat to our national security.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd the Monroe Doctrine is not ancient history. As recently as 2018, Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, called the Monroe Doctrine \u2018as relevant today as it was the day it was written\u2019. In 2019, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, John Bolton, declared \u2018the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well\u2019.\u201d\n\nFurther condemning the US grandstanding and hypocritical response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Sanders explained, \u201cTo put it simply, even if Russia was not ruled by a corrupt authoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, Russia, like the United States, would still have an interest in the security policies of its neighbours.\u201d\n\nThe Almanac of American Politics calls Sanders, serving his third term in the US Senate after winning re-election in 2018, a \u201cpractical and successful legislator.\u201d\n\nThe one-time American presidential aspirant did not mince words expressing his displeasure against the US government\u2019s subversiveness against Russia.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if, for example, Mexico was to form a military alliance with a US adversary?\u201d said Sanders. \u201cCountries should be free to make their own foreign policy choices, but making those choices wisely requires a serious consideration of the costs and benefits.\u201d He further pointed out that \u201cthe fact is that the US and Ukraine entering into a deeper security relationship is likely to have some very serious costs \u2013 for both countries.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Concerns as NNPC Recorded Zero Remittance to Federation Account in January",
          "text": "* Petrol subsidy gulped N210bn\n\n*OPEC+ trims forecast for 2022 oil market surplus\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite the rising international prices of oil, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited failed to remit its statutory funding to the Federation Account which is jointly operated by the federal, state and local governments, in January 2022.\n\nThat was the second time in less than a year that the national oil company (NOC) would be unable to deliver a kobo to the joint account, following the same occurrence in April last year, when the firm announced zero remittance for the month.\n\nIn addition, a document detailing NNPC\u2019s activities for the month under review, presented during the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) held last Thursday, indicated that the NOC expended a whopping N210.38 billion on petrol subsidy during the month.\n\nTHISDAY recalls that with a deficit of approximately N2 trillion out of its projected N2.511 trillion, the NNPC was unable to remit roughly 80 per cent of its projected contribution to the Federation Account in 2021.\n\nFor the entire 12 months of last year, the NNPC disbursed N542 billion as against the budgeted N2.511 trillion, despite a monthly contribution estimate of N209.3 billion. The N542 billion represented just about 21. 6 per cent of the total expected contribution of the NNPC to the joint account.\n\nThe development underscored how a combination of factors, including declining oil production, rising subsidy payments and high oil production costs, have hobbled the organisation\u2019s performance despite the increasing oil prices which overshot $105 per barrel last week.\n\nEarlier in the year, President Muhammadu Buhari had backtracked on the planned full deregulation of the downstream sector, including the wholesale removal of petrol subsidy, citing the negative impact it would have on the poor in the country.\n\nFor decades, Nigeria\u2019s attempt to fully free the downstream oil and gas industry has met with a brick wall. The latest effort has also been pushed forward by about 18 months, effectively exempting the current administration which will exit by May 2023 of any burden.\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis in January 2022, had shown that total deductions for petrol subsidy or what the government terms under-recovery was about N1.43 trillion for 2021.\n\nThe journey to zero remittance in January was envisaged by close watchers of the industry as the NNPC only delivered a paltry N14.8 billion, N10.54 billion and N20 billion in October, November and December respectively last year.\n\nIn December, the three tiers of government shared N675.946 billion as FAAC revenue for the month of November while in January, it shared N699.82 billion for December.\n\nBut the total funds shared in February markedly decreased to N574.66 billion, raising concerns over the capacity of sub-nationals to meet their current financial obligations.\n\nThe amount shared by the federal, state and local governments dropped to a four-year low this month, a huge blow to states that are already struggling to survive.\n\nBut in the latest monthly presentation to FAAC held on February 24, obtained by TheCable, NNPC pointed out that the N210 billion shortfall included a December 2021 value of N176.48 billion plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N33.90 billion accruing from 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the oil firm stated that it would deduct N242.5 billion, which was the about N143.7 billion for January 2022 recovery and November spot arrears of N98.8 billion, during next month\u2019s FAAC meeting. It, however stated that the national oil company recorded N383 billion as gross revenue from crude oil sales in January, a dip from the projected N414.9 billion.\n\nThe fall would significantly negatively affect states that are presently experiencing fiscal stress and had been kicking against deductions of the shortfall from FAAC remittances.\n\nWhile an ad-hoc committee of the National Economic Council (NEC) had recommended gradual deregulation of petrol prices by February 2022 to reduce the pressure on revenue accruing to states, recently Buhari asked the National Assembly to approve the N2.557 trillion budget for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies OPEC+ have revised down forecast for the 2022 oil market surplus by about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, according to a base scenario in a technical committee report seen by Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe data which is part of a report the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) prepares for OPEC+ ministers \u2013 also showed stocks in the developed world standing at 62 million barrels below the 2015 to 2019 average by the end of the year.\n\nIn a previous forecast it had predicted the stocks would reach 20 million barrels above the same average by that point.\n\nMinisters from OPEC and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, will meet on March 2 to decide whether to increase output by 400,000 bpd in April.\n\nSources from the group told Reuters their output deal is showing no cracks so far after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the group is likely to stick to a planned output rise despite crude topping $100 a barrel.\n\nData from a separate JTC report also showed the group produced in January 972,000 bpd less than the targets outlined by the deal, compared with 824,000 less in December.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "APC Governors Still Divided Over Zoning of Party Offices",
          "text": "*Buni expected to come up with list of offices across board\n\n*Party names Buni, Abiodun, Sanwo-Olu, Abdulrahman, others in convention sub-committees\n\n*Governors meet tomorrow, likely to deliberate on election timetable\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Peter Uzoho\n\nA prominent governor of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, said division has continued to plague the party over the zoning formula that was made public last week.\n\nSome of them argued the list was sprung on them and the party never adopted it before it was announced. They have, therefore, argued that it could not stand, thus dismissing the zoning arrangement in circulation as mere suggestion.\n\nThey also argued that it was not governors who should announce zoning of party offices; that it should be the function of the party and not governors.\n\nHowever, while they have agreed that the next chairman of the APC should come from the north and the party\u2019s presidential candidate from the southern part of the country, its leaders, mostly governors, were not comfortable with the zoning formula for other positions in the party, THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\n\u201cIt is the issue of the deputy chairman and others that they are dealing with. Under the current arrangement, they want to retain John James Akpanudoedehe as secretary; Ken Nnamani as Deputy National Chairman and make Farouk Aliu Deputy Chairman, north, which is where the conflict is, because the north-west governors don\u2019t want him to be deputy chairman,\u201d the source explained yesterday.\n\nThe acting Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party, Mai Mala Buni, was expected to come up with a zoning arrangement of offices across board to deliberate upon and perhaps adopt, but that is yet to happen.\n\nBut, with the release of INEC timetable, which has left little room for any further machination, there is renewed urgency to get things done quickly. Between the March 26 date for the party\u2019s convention and beginning of primary season on April 4, according to INEC timetable released on Saturday, there is no enough time for the expected new NWC of the party to prepare for the primaries.\n\nHowever, APC governors would be meeting tomorrow, and their meeting is not be unconnected to the election timetable recently released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and the unusual duration between primaries and the general election.\n\nThe governors are also likely to deliberate on the contentious zoning list that is receiving a lot of pushback from party stakeholders.\n\nAccording to the THISDAY source with knowledge of the happenings in APC, who preferred anonymity, the division in the party was telling, adding that some three governors from the north had usurped the powers of the CECPC.\n\nHe said what was widely circulated as zoning formula was no more than a proposal by some elements in the party, which was yet to be approved by the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC.\n\nThe source claimed that, contrary to the impression being created by those promulgating the unofficial zoning formula, it was just an idea mooted by some people and sold to the party leadership.\n\nHe contended that the zoning arrangement had not undergone proper review by critical stakeholders, let alone getting the approval of the APC leadership led by Buni.\n\nAccording to the source, who was not pleased with some of the recent happenings in the party, the three governors, also from the north, have literally seized the powers of the caretaker committee and were driving the affairs of the party, thereby undermining Buni, for obvious self-interest.\n\nThe source said some of the meetings of the party leadership last week agreed on a new convention date, adding that President Muhanmadu Buhari, might have settled for a former governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu, from North Central, as the consensus choice for national chairman.\n\nThe source, thus, noted that the next president of the country would come from the south for the purpose of geo-political and ethnic balancing, stressing that anything short of this basic understanding could spell doom for the party.\n\nThese, nonetheless, the APC, last night, named the Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege; Mai Mala Buni, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Abdulrasaq Abdulrahmnan, Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; and Governor of Cross River State, Ben Ayade, as Chairmen of the national convention sub-committees amongst others, ahead of the party\u2019s convention slated for March 26.\n\nBut in further explaining the involvement of his three northern colleagues in issues relating to the national convention, the source said, Buni had never taken any decision without consulting Buhari, whom he said was Chairman of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the party.\n\nThe three governors, he claimed, had been railroading the party\u2019s leadership into taking many decisions without consulting other members. He contended that this did not augur well for the APC, as these actions had been mostly driven by personal ambition rather than the overall interest of the party.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cObviously, a few governors are trying to usurp the powers of the party. For instance, the postponement of the national convention and the zoning list announced to the press, the governors and other stakeholders of the party never discussed or agreed on it; we just heard it in the media.\n\n\u201cAs far as some of us are concerned, that zoning list making the rounds is only a proposal by those few governors. The party may well adopt it or may set up a zoning committee, which to some of us is the right thing to do. The ideal thing was for us to have set up a zoning committee that would agree on the zones to allocate the party positions to.\n\n\u201cSo, by announcing a list that was not agreed on as the party\u2019s position, was more like an imposition. No decision was taken. The president only said all he wanted was to make sure we have a consensus. No decision and they just went and organised a press conference with a zoning list.\n\n\u201cThe proper thing is for the party to have a zoning committee that would consult and arrive at the zoning formula. Even if they are going to arrive at the same answer, they must be seen to have consulted with members of the party. That is very important so that our party is not seen as a party in confusion, like the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), would like to make Nigerians believe.\n\n\u201cThere was a meeting to announce the postponement of the convention and some governors were unhappy that the convention was being postponed and they were not aware and that really got the governors upset.\u201d\n\nThe governor also disclosed that based on the decision to zone the APC national chairman to the north, the party\u2019s presidential candidate must come from the south.\n\nHis words, \u201cThe presidential candidate is going to come from the south and it is likely going to be a Christian presidential candidate. You cannot have the chairman of the party to be a Muslim and a presidential candidate a Muslim, it is not possible.\n\n\u201cAnd if the presidential candidate is a Christian, the vice is going to be a Muslim from the north, invariably, you cannot have a Christian vice president from the north, when the presidential candidate is a Christian.\u201d\n\nThe source, who further buttressed his position with the setting up of zoning committee by the party, contended that he had been vindicated by that development, adding that the route earlier taken was synonymous with placing the cart before the horse.\n\nWhile condemning the activities of the three northern governors, he said the Buni-led committee should be commended for the stability it brought to the party. He claimed that a lot of the APC governors were happy with Buni, because of how he had been able to resolve the disputes in the APC states without undermining the governors.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cBut some have remained antagonistic and have been scheming to have their way obviously, because of their selfish political interests and despite benefiting immensely from Buni\u2019s decision to recognise the excos.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that Buni didn\u2019t betray the governors, because this same man, if not for him, most of the governors would not have had their excos as the recognised party structures in their states. He made sure every governor got what he wanted, which is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cThe governors would have been battling with their contenders or the former governors in their states. But Buni made it favourable for the governors by making sure that right from the ward to the state EXCO levels, the governors have those they wanted in charge.\n\n\u201cThis same man (Buni) was also able to bring in the Zamfara, Ebonyi and Cross River governors, to the party. So, Buni has helped in stabilising the party. That was why when some persons were accusing him of misconduct and were making noise, the man said he would resign if they continued the noise and everybody calmed down.\u201d\n\nThe source, however, reiterated that Buhari wanted the chairman of the party to come from North-central and has settled for Adamu as the next party chairman as well as the deputy chairmen, a decision he said the president had communicated to the CECPC.\n\n\u201cHowever, Buni told the president that he wants to retain the Secretary of the CECPC as the party\u2019s secretary, which he has agreed to, but when some governors heard it, they were up in arms, because everybody as you know has different interest.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to have party leadership that they feel would do their bidding, because we all have our different ambitions,\u201d he said.\n\nOn sub-committee membership for national convention, the party, in a short statement, named other members of the sub-committees as Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, among others.\n\nNational Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe said the 20 sub-committees constituted by the party were in line with the schedule of activities for the National Convention as resolved by the caretaker committee.\n\nThe party noted that each of the committees, except the Central Planning Committee, had a 12-man team with all Caretaker Committee as members.\n\nThe party added that the Secretariat Support Committee had a seven-man team, while the Accreditation Committee has 41 members and other committees were made up of 40 members each.\n\nAccording to APC, the Central Planning Committee is chaired by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni; Screening Committee is chaired by Kwara State Governor, Abdulrasaq Abdulrahmnan; while the Election Committee is chaired by Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nMr. Emmanuel Emeka is the secretary.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodima heads the Screening Appeal Committee, Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Bello Masari would serve as Election Appeal Committee chairman, while the Legal Committee is headed by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nGovernor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle heads Accommodation Committee, while Venue/Decoration/Site Servicing Committee has Governor David Umahi of Eboyin State as its chairman, and Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State heads Transport/Logistics Committee.\n\nGovernor of Gombe State Inuwa Yahaya will chair Budget Committee, and Finance Committee is headed by Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State, while Digital Committee has Kashifu Inuwa as chairman, and Convention Legacy and Rapporteur Committee has Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum as chairman.\n\nOther committees are: Media/Publicity headed by Sanwo-Olu, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State heads the Security/Protocol Committee, while Entertainment/Welfare Committee has Deputy Speaker, Hon Ahmed Wase, as chairman. THISDAY was reliably informed that some alterations may still be effected on the list.\n\nAPC had earlier fixed February 26 for its national convention before it was rescheduled last week after a meeting of the party\u2019s governors with Buhari.\n\nAt the meeting, the party also agreed to zone the national chairmanship position to the North-central, while the north would swap other party positions with the south as obtained in the Adams Oshiomhole National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum hail Buhari for signing electoral law\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nFollowing the signing of the new electoral bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday released a new timetable for the 2023 elections, with the conduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them now scheduled for April 4, 2022, to June 3, 2022.\n\nThis is coming as the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nUnder the new timetable for the 2023 general election, INEC has shifted the presidential and National Assembly elections from February 18 to February 25, 2023, while the governorship elections will hold on March 11, 2023.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday, INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said the presidential and National Assembly elections would now hold on February 25 next year instead of the earlier announced date of February 18.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the commission has decided to adjust the dates of the 2023 general election to ensure compliance with the provisions of the new law.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the presidential and National Assembly elections will now hold on Saturday, February 25, 2023, while the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections will hold two weeks later on Saturday, March 11, 2023. With this adjustment, the 2023 general election is now 363 days away,\u201d he explained.\n\nYakubu disclosed that under the law, there are critical time-bound activities from the publication of notice of election to the conduct of polls, which form the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for elections.\n\nAccording to him, some of the critical activities and their dates of implementation are as follows: \u201cPublication of Notice of Election \u2013 Monday, February 28, 2022;\n\n\u201cConduct of party primaries, including the resolution of disputes arising from them \u2013 Monday, April 4, 2022, to Friday, June 3, 2022.\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online portal for Presidential and National Assembly election \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, June 10, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, June 17, 2022;\n\n\u201cSubmission of nomination forms to INEC via the online nomination portal for Governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 9.00 am on Friday, July 1, 2022, to 6.00 pm on Friday, July 15, 2022;\n\n\u201cCommencement of campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections -Wednesday, September 28, 2022; commencement of campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 Wednesday, October 12, 2022; last day of the campaign by political parties for Presidential and National Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, February 23, 2023; last day of the campaign by political parties for governorship and State Assembly elections \u2013 midnight on Thursday, March 9, 2023,\u201d Yakubu further explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman stated explained that the Notice of Election would be published in INEC offices in all the states of the Federation as required by law on Monday, February 28, 2022.\n\nYakubu said that with the coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022, the commission would work assiduously to conclude and publish new Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections that are consistent with the Act.\n\n\u201cThese Regulations and Guidelines, as well as Manuals issued by the Commission, are all part of the legal regulatory framework for elections.\n\n\u201cTheir timely publication will enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to become conversant with their provisions as they prepare for the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe INEC chairman, who described the new electoral law as historic said that it was because it was the fourth time since the restoration of democracy in Nigeria in May 1999 that the Electoral Act was repealed and re-enacted.\n\nHe explained that the 1998 \u2013 1999 elections were administered by transitional decrees until the 2001 Electoral Act was passed into law.\n\nThen, he said, the Act was repealed and re-enacted as the Electoral Act 2002 which was in turn repealed and re-enacted in 2006, 2010 and now we have the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nHe said that in 2017, the commission decided to establish fixed dates for general elections in Nigeria, explaining that the decision was based on INEC\u2019s determination to create certainty in the electoral calendar and to enable all stakeholders in the electoral process to prepare adequately for elections.\n\n\u201cBy that decision, presidential and National Assembly elections shall hold on the third Saturday of February of each general election year, while governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections shall follow two weeks later,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the 2023 general election was initially scheduled to commence on February 18, 2023, with the presidential and National Assembly elections, followed by the governorship and state Houses of Assembly elections on March 4, 2023.\n\nHe, however, pointed out that the Commission could not release the detailed Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the General Election, as it normally would, because of the pending enactment of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nWith the bill now being signed into law, therefore, he said, the Electoral Act 2022, together with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), form the legal basis for conducting all elections in Nigeria.\n\nIn particular, he said that the Electoral Act provides strict timelines for the implementation of electoral activities based on the date of the general election.\n\n\u201cOne of the significant timelines is the publication of Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding an election, which has now lapsed,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded stakeholders, especially the political parties, of their responsibility to adhere strictly to the timelines in this Timetable and Schedule of Activities, as well as all other timelines established by the commission.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary that all political parties comply with the extant legal framework, ensure proper organisation and management of party primaries and the nomination of qualified candidates to prevent unnecessary litigations and rancour,\u201d Yakubu told all shareholders.\n\nSpeaking on the capacity of INEC to transmit all elections results in real-time, Yakubu said that from the reports available to the commission and its independent assessment INEC can transmit elections results to all the 774 local government areas and the 120,000 polling wards across the Federation.\n\nOn the BVAS, the INEC cha\u00ecrman said so far in the six by-elections in Ondo, Imo, Plateau and Cross Rivers states that there were no complaints against its operations\n\nHe pointed out the commission is not anticipating any extra budget to implement the new electoral law.\n\nPANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Middle Belt Forum Hail Buhari for Signing Electoral Law\n\nMeanwhile, the apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; PANDEF and the MBF have hailed President Buhari for signing the electoral bill.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonna, told THISDAY yesterday that it was a welcome development that the president finally signed the bill into law.\n\nHe, therefore, challenged the INEC to ensure that nothing jeopardises the credibility of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe president had assured Nigerians that he will leave an improved electoral system by the time he serves out his tenure and we are glad that today, we now have an Electoral Act that substantially captures the key ingredients of a working, responsible and responsive democracy.\n\n\u201cThe President and National Assembly members have done their parts; it is now left for INEC to deliver. Let them know clearly that there\u2019s no room for excuses any longer,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman however declared that the law would not completely remove malpractices from the nation\u2019s electoral system, explaining that the political actors would always seek ways of circumventing the system in their desperation for power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had laws and the politicians know about that. One clear thing is that the malpractices are induced by the political elites. They will always find ways of achieving their plans. We are however hopeful that the situation will be appreciably reduced,\u201d he added.\n\nOn its part, PANDEF has also applauded President Buhari for signing into law the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe Forum, in a formal reaction by the spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, also called on the INEC to ensure the full implementation of the new electoral law.\n\nDescribing the president\u2019s assent to the bill as a welcome development after all the dilly-dally, Robinson said the action was perhaps the best thing President Buhari has done in terms of strengthening the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and the National Assembly both deserve commendation. The ball is now in the court of the electoral commission to ensure that the Act is implemented to the letter in the entire electoral process, with adherence to every detail, in all parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu, has also congratulated President Buhari for signing the Electoral Act into law, describing it as a welcome development.\n\nHe said Nigerians yearned to have a process that would translate to a transparent election that every Nigerian would trust.\n\nThe page however said it was not yet over, pointing out that INEC would need to do more to complement what the President has done, and ensure a credible election.\n\n\u201cWe welcome and congratulate Mr President for signing the Electoral Act into law.\n\n\u201cHaving signed, the job is not over yet, because we would want a two-stage transmission of results. First, INEC must ensure that in an election, the figures of accredited voters are first transmitted from the polling unit before the result of the election. This is to ensure that the figures of election results do not exceed the figures of accredited voters.\n\n\u201cIf that is not done, we are back to square one. The riggers out there will manipulate the system by writing the results at the polling units and asking the electoral officers to transmit what they have written. But if the accredited voters\u2019 figures are transmitted first, that will be difficult because the figure\u2019s results cannot be bloated above the accredited voters\u2019 figures.\n\n\u201cStage two is for the election results to be transmitted from the polling unit; these results must tally with figures of accredited voters in that polling unit.\n\nSo, we are calling on the National Assembly and INEC to ensure that this two-stage process is adhered to, to have a transparent and credible election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Aggregate money supply rises to N44.56tn\n\nFestus Akanbi\n\nIn line with the resolve of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to halt a regime of arbitrage in the foreign exchange market, some Nigerian banks have started exposing the identities of customers, who allegedly obtained dollars by false pretence, and traded them at a profit in the parallel market.\n\nThis is coming as the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nSome bank customers have been taking advantage of the lucrative 37 per cent differential between the official and black market exchange rates by obtaining the dollar at the official rate of about N416, only to subsequently sell in the unauthorised market at a more expensive average rate of about N570.\n\nThese customers can beat regulations by presenting false travel documents, prompting the apex bank to direct banks to notify their customers of an impending crackdown on saboteurs in the forex market.\n\nHowever, a report by Bloomberg yesterday revealed that some banks have begun to implement the CBN\u2019s directives by publishing the names of clients found to have filed suspicious claims for forex transactions on their websites last week.\n\nFor instance, Zenith Bank Plc, the nation\u2019s biggest lender by market value, has published 987 names of customers engaging in the illegal practice on its website, Fidelity Bank Plc identified 83 customers; First City Monument Bank Plc listed eight names so far, while Wema Bank published one name. The list of banks that complied also included the United Bank for Africa Plc.\n\nThe apex bank had directed banks to identify such customers and ensure they refund the hard currency. The regulator first alerted banks of the ongoing practice last year.\n\nThe CBN had said: \u201cConsequently, further to the various measures already put in place, all banks are hereby directed to publish on their websites the names and BVN of defaulting customers who present fake travel documents or cancel their tickets and fail to return the purchased PTA/BTA within two weeks as stipulated in the customer declaration form signed by them.\u201d\n\nSome deposit money banks acting on the directive of the CBN had sent notices to their customers warning that identities and Bank Verification Number (BVN) of those who contravene the apex bank\u2019s new forex policy on overseas personal and business travels would be published.\n\nThe CBN had also directed that travellers who buy foreign exchange from banks for travel purposes but fail to embark on the trip after two weeks of their scheduled travel date must return the forex to the banks.\n\nThe banks in their notices also pointed out consequences for those customers who engage in fraudulent and unethical practices with regards to the purchase of Personal Travel Allowances (PTA) and Business Travel Allowances (BTA).\n\nIn its notice to customers, one of the Tier 1 banks had said: \u201cWe have been directed by the Central Bank of Nigeria to inform all our customers that unethical practices to circumvent the new CBN policy on the sale of forex, such as the presentation of false travel documents, visas, and the cancellation of flight tickets, after purchasing personal travel allowance and business travel allowance, will no longer be tolerated.\n\n\u201cDefaulting customers who present fraudulent travel credentials or cancel their tickets and fail to refund the purchased PTA and BTA within two weeks, as stated in the signed customer declaration form, will have their identities and bank verification numbers published.\n\n\u201cWe aim to implement this policy immediately as an organisation that is fully compliant with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cOur bank is committed to partnering with the CBN to ensure a transparent, efficient and stable FX Market that meets the needs of all legitimate users.\u201d\n\nAggregate Money Supply Rises to N44.56tn in January\n\nMeanwhile, the aggregate broad money supply, M3 Money, which represents the amount of money circulating in the economy, rose to N44.56 trillion in January, representing a 1.70 per cent growth year-to-date, a report by the CBN, has shown.\n\nA recently released Depository Corporations Survey by the apex bank, quoted by Cowry Asset Management Limited, showed that the growth was driven by a 1.46 per cent increase in M2 to N44.46 trillion and a sharp increase in CBN bills to N107.38 billion, from N100 million in the preceding month) amid efforts to rein in surplus liquidity.\n\nM2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and is easily convertible near money\n\nHowever, analysts from Cowry Asset Management Limited noted that the growth in central bank bills also came with its cost implications, as well as increased indebtedness of the apex bank.\n\nAccording to the latest edition of Cowry Financial Markets Review, Outlook & Recommended Stocks, growth in Broad Money supply was on the back of increases in Quasi Money (consisting of time deposits, near-maturing securities, foreign currencies, etc) and Narrow Money or M1 Money (comprising demand deposits and currency outside banks) by 0.34 per cent and 3.03 per cent to N25.74 trillion and N18.72 trillion, respectively.\n\n\u201cIncreases in quasi money may not be unconnected to, among other things, growing appetite of pension funds administrators to place retirement savings with commercial banks at relatively attractive interest rates. \u201cAs reported in the February 11, 2022 edition of our CWR, we observed that money moved out of T-bills securities to Local Money Market Securities (LMMS), especially bank placements,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt noted that the total funds invested in this investment category rose by 20.04 per cent to N2.03 trillion in December 2021 (lifting its share of the total assets to 15.09 per cent), from N1.69 trillion in December 2020 (or 13.71 per cent of total assets).\n\nThe CBN document was quoted as saying that that Reserve Money rose by 2.36 per cent to N13.61 trillion as bank reserves with the Central Bank increased by 3.51 per cent to N10.32 trillion (partly in tandem with increased deposits at the banks), to partly offset by a 5.52 per cent decline in currency outside banks to N2.78 trillion.\n\nOn the asset side, Net Domestic Credit grew by 2.49 per cent to N49.73 trillion as Credit to the Private Sector upped by 0.73 per cent to N35.45 trillion while Credit to the Government increased by 7.13 per cent to N14.28 trillion. However, Net Foreign Assets moderated by 1.79 per cent amid pressures on Nigeria\u2019s foreign sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Cowry Assets analysts have warned that the rise in the Narrow Money without a faster rise in GDP may result in higher inflation in 2022.\n\nIt noted that in 2021, the velocity of Narrow Money moderated to 10.16 times from 11.49 times in the preceding year even though Narrow Money rose by 14 per cent over the period, saying the productivity of the country needs a lot of improvement going forward.\n\nThe report warned that the escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and the attendant instability in the global oil market will exert pressure on the nation\u2019s external reserves.\n\nIt said: \u201cMeanwhile, in the wake of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, we are concerned that Nigeria would not optimally benefit from any ensuing rise in crude oil prices due to its suboptimal crude oil production. This would increase pressure on the external reserves as well as exchange rates as oil dollar revenues, its primary foreign currency earner, would struggle to meet the higher cost of imported refined products in addition to other imports.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenyan influencers were paid $10 to $15 to discredit controversial bills on Twitter",
          "text": "In the past 3 years, the Kenyan parliament has discussed two pieces of health legislation that has sparked online debates. The bills are the Reproductive Healthcare Bill and the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, also known as the Surrogacy Bill.\n\nAccording to a new report by Mozilla Foundation, Kenyans\u2019 conversations on Twitter on these health bills have been manipulated by disinformation campaigns sponsored by an anti-choice Spanish advocacy group, CitizenGO. The report shows that CitizenGO, a group that has been linked to the Spanish far-right, by exploiting the Twitter Trends algorithm, was able to input itself in these conversations in an attempt to influence debates around health bills.\n\nAccording to briefs seen by the researchers of the report, the messages the campaign used to attack activists contained cartoon caricatures and memes that echo messaging by American and European right-wing groups.\n\nThe Reproductive Healthcare Bill was introduced to the parliament in 2020 and is supposed to outlaw forced sterilisations; make prenatal, delivery and postnatal services free and provide rights to reproductive healthcare services to every woman in Kenya, including adolescents. In 2021, the Surrogacy Bill proposed Kenyan politicians should develop standards and regulations around surrogacy\u2014an arrangement where a woman (a surrogate mother) carries a child in her belly on behalf of another woman, who receives the child after birth.\n\nOdanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation based in Nairobi, reviewed content posted between 2019 and 2021 and discovered that CitizenGo, and accounts linked to it, had tweeted 20,811 times and engaged in 11 campaigns\u2014when a large number of accounts tweeting using a predetermined hashtag or keyword. 10 of these problematic campaigns made it to the Trend section.\n\nThe Mozilla report reveals that CitizenGO paid the owner of these accounts or \u201cdisinformation influencers\u201d around $10 to $15 to make tailored tweets that discredited the bills.\n\nThe campaign made multiple false and misleading claims about surrogacy and reproductive health. For example, a tweet in the campaign claimed that children of surrogates display behavioural and emotional issues\u2014a claim the report revealed the African Population Health Research Center (APHRC) had debunked. Those tweets went on to attack journalists, activists and politicians that advocated for reproductive rights or the two reproductive bills.\n\nIn response to this report, Twitter has permanently suspended 240 accounts connected to this disinformation campaign for violating its platform manipulation and spam policy.\n\nA booming disinformation industry\n\nLast year, Madung and Brian Obilo, another Mozilla fellow, discovered, through a series of interviews with social media influencers who coordinated disinformation attacks, were responsible for spreading the hashtag #AnarchistJudges. The tweets under this hashtag, which trended countrywide, cast suspicion on the competence and integrity of court officials that were against the Constitutional Amendments Bill of 2021 in Kenya.\n\nLike this campaign, it was also coordinated through WhatsApp and social media influencers were paid between 10$ to 15$ per campaign to tweet predetermined malicious tweets.\n\nThe Mozilla Foundation report noted that the campaign had all the patterns of a disinformation campaign: heavy repetition of content under hashtags, newly created accounts tweeting political content, synchronised posting period and false tweets.\n\nHeightening Twitter Trend\u2019s criticism\n\nTwitter\u2019s Trends section helps users identify the most discussed topics on the platform and also help them find popular information or discussion. They vary depending on geographical location and personal interest.\n\nBut the feature has come under fire multiple times over the years for spreading hate and disinformation, and at some point, external critics and Twitter employees suggested eradicating the feature altogether, after it struggled to deal with disinformation around the US presidential election. One of Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up the feature was by adding more context to trending topics.\n\nMadung expressed concerns about the potential influence of these disinformation actors in the upcoming Kenya election: \u201cHealth is a political issue & more so reproductive health. As we mentioned in the report, there\u2019s clear evidence that these groups will be looking to exert their influence on candidates and citizens to ultimately affect the ballot in favour of candidates that agree with them.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that Twitter should assess individual countries and map out how the Trends section can be used to push disinformation; establish collaborations with local researchers, and develop a transparent partnership with fact-checkers and civil societies, all of whom can offer context about the region. Last year, Twitter was forced to disable the Trends feature in Ethiopia as it was increasingly used to push by warring parties to spread hate campaigns. By the way, researchers could not find any tangible impact of this intervention on the subsequent volume of hate speech on the platform.\n\nLast year, an investigation by BuzzFeed and Digital Africa Research Lab revealed that Nigerian influencers paid to tweet in a coordinated manner successfully manipulated Twitter Trends in order to sway public opinion and court judgement in favour of Venezuelan politician, Alex Saab.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to manipulate (content) in jurisdictions such as ours where the volume of content is not as high as countries such as the US,\u201d Madung tells TechCabal. With African countries increasingly vulnerable to disinformation actors on Twitter, a collaborative effort between Twitter, policymakers, civil societies and media organisations will be crucial to keep online discourse saner and difficult to manipulate.\n\nUPDATE: This story was updated to reflect Digital Africa Research Labs\u2019 role as a joint investigator in the Alex Saab investigation.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Meet the 19 year old Nigerian building his own blockchain empire",
          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway.\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited him home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. But I made a deployment error that cost the company $10,000.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nThere are two types of people in the world right now: those following the Ukraine-Russian tensions religiously and the others who are tired of any news related to the conflict. For now, I\u2019m neither.\n\nIn the last one week, we\u2019ve seen stocks rise and fall, Internet \u201crestrictions\u201d, new Internet connections (thank you, Elon Musk), crypto donations \u2014 more on this later \u2014 mass immigrations, and unfortunately, lives lost as tensions rise and the conflict drags on.\n\nWe\u2019ve also seen sanctions \u2014 effective or not \u2014 club owners banned (Hello, Emmanuel Paul), Twitter bants on different ends of the spectrum, and more troops deployed. I think I speak for most people when I say we do not want to see World War 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHopefully, we don\u2019t, but for now, the show must go on. We\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe implications of Flutterwave\u2019s Fintech as a Service\n\nCrowdfunding a war, crypto style, and\n\nThe 5G lights turning on in Zimbabwe\n\nThe implications of a Fintech as a Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow this journey: By 2030, the global embedded finance \u2014 or Fintech as a Service (FaaS) \u2014 market is expected to be worth $7.2 trillion.\n\nCurrently, according to the Google Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, due in part to increased fundraising, the need for software developers on the continent has skyrocketed, with startups creating 50% of that demand. We also can\u2019t forget all the poaching stories and talent scarcity that we bemoan on Twitter.\n\nLast week, we told you about Flutterwave\u2019s recent launch of its own FaaS platform. And from what the company says, this means startups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure.\n\nWhat does this mean for the African tech ecosystem? For one, a student wanting to build a grocery platform doesn\u2019t have to worry about building out any financial services aspects. Plug in Flutterwave\u2019s API, and they are good to go.\n\nTwo birds, one stone: And for Flutterwave, it means they get to cash in on an untapped but pretty valuable market.\n\nBut there\u2019s more, and you can find out here: What Flutterwave\u2019s fintech as a service means for the African tech ecosystem\n\nCrowdfunding a war\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the first things people note about war \u2014 apart from the lives and potentials lost \u2014 is this: war costs money. It is a costly endeavour and has seen national coffers wiped out for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring World War 1, the UK and Germany sold war bonds to fund their war efforts \u2014 they still had to pay back, though. In 2014, Ukrainians called for help, with private citizens like Vitaliy Deynega, a freelance IT specialist, setting up Come Back Alive on Patreon to raise money to buy equipment. In 2021, Myanmar rebels crowdfunded their resistance to the military coup in July.\n\nCrowdfunding is not a new phenomenon in war, and Ukraine has some experience in that department. But on Saturday, February 26, 2022, things took an exciting turn.\n\nThe Ukrainian government tweeted, saying it was now accepting cryptocurrency donations. While federal governments may have sought crypto donations before, this appears to be the first of its kind. It is even more surprising considering the general wariness towards crypto from national authorities.\n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time crypto has been used in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, as donations appear to have been steadily creeping in since 2018. At press time, the Ukrainian government had raised $8 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nSidebar: Remember when the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria began receiving support in cryptocurrency?\n\nThere are also rumours that Russia may also be receiving funding via crypto as an alternative due to the sanctions being imposed. There are also concerns about how cryptocurrency could worsen issues with corruption in Ukraine.\n\nEither way, the world\u2019s first crypto \u2018war\u2019 is creating some interesting precedents.\n\nZimbabwe joins the 5G league\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Ivan Radic Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nWhenever I see news about 5G, my mind automatically goes to Nigeria and how far we\u2019ve come in our 5G journey. Last we heard, MTN and Mafab Communications Ltd have made complete payment for their licenses, and the 3.5 GHz spectrum needed for deployment has been handed over to the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC). But that\u2019s not on today\u2019s menu.\n\nGood news for Zimbabweans: On Friday, February 25, 2022, telecom operator, Econet, in partnership with global technology infrastructure suppliers Ericsson and ZTE, launched the 5G network in Harare, Zimbabwe\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Southern African country becomes the third African country to enjoy the high-speed 5G network after South Africa and Kenya. For now, it would only be rolled out in Harare for individual and enterprise customers, with more cities to come.\n\nBy the end of April, Econet said it should have deployed 22 base stations countrywide.\n\nEconet has the largest market share in the Zimbabwean telco market \u2014 61% \u2014 and it is no surprise it is the first telecom to launch the 5G network ahead of Telecel and State-owned NetOne Cellular. It was also the first to launch the 4G network in the country in 2013. However, there is no accurate representation of the amount of 4G coverage.\n\nZimbabwe joins the 78 other countries where 5G has been launched, while Econet could very well be the 201st network operator.\n\nMeanwhile, in other parts of Africa, Ghana has a proposed launch date of 2023, Egypt has no set launch date, and Nigeria\u2019s January 2022 deadline has passed.\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/watching/reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nIdentitypass is hiring.

In addition to its payment infrastructure, the startup unveiled the addition of Apple and Google Pay, Grow (its SME financing service), and fintech as a service (FaaS).\n\nStartups can now embed card issuance, account opening, and wallet features into their services using its infrastructure. The announcement is the first of its kind in Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem, and this article provides some insight into the implications for African startups.\n\nWhat is fintech as a service?\n\nAkurateco, a Dutch software provider, defines fintech as a service as offering financial technology as a service. Startups that provide FaaS often provide an API that enables other startups or institutions to provide various financial services, including payments, wallet provision, and card issuance.\n\nUnder this arrangement, the technology provider is completely responsible for developing and maintaining its platform, while the startups it serves focus on providing unique services for their customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave founder and CEO, Olugbenga Agboola\n\nAfrican API fintech startups have gained more attention in recent years, but they often focus on a few services. While startups like Mono and Okra concentrate on providing financial data and payment APIs, Flutterwave intends to provide an API that meets all of a business\u2019 financial needs.\n\nIn Flutterwave\u2019s case, a grocery delivery startup, for instance, that signs up to use its FaaS API can choose a custom offer that enables it to provide a wallet and payment option for its customers while it focuses on aggregating meal choices for its customers.\n\nHow does FaaS affect the ecosystem?\n\nIn a statement explaining why B Capital invested in Flutterwave\u2019s Series D round, Matt Levinson, a partner at the firm, said, \u201cFlutterwave may ultimately build one of the most consequential fintech businesses in the world, enabling hundreds of thousands of merchants to transact online and connect Africa to the global economy.\u201d\n\nBy including fintech as a service in its offerings, Flutterwave is definitely on the path to doing that, but how does this affect other startups in Africa?\n\nImproved customer service\n\nCustomers are usually the biggest beneficiaries when businesses make changes to their business model, which could well be the case. By enabling other companies to integrate financial services to existing offerings, they allow the businesses to expand already existing offers.\n\nAll things considered, this should enable them to focus on their core business, providing customers with a better experience and increasing competition among startups.\n\nFaster time to market\n\nThe time needed to add a new feature to a startup could take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, but with fintech as a service, a startup could launch a new feature in as little as days. This cuts down their time to market and allows them to receive feedback faster.\n\nHowever, the tech is not all they stand to benefit from. Providing financial services often means that businesses deal with customers\u2019 data. Consequently, regulators often have to step in to ensure that there are no abuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIntegrating Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS API will help them bypass most regulatory requirements. Yet, while it allows them to get to market faster, it also reduces the startup\u2019s ability to innovate and could reduce the quality of its services.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n\nAn individual\u2019s financial data could be used to exploit the person, and that explains why the fintech industry is probably the most regulated sector in Nigeria. Providing a FaaS API is not limited to fintech companies, with other industries capable of integrating with them.\n\nOutsourcing the provision of their fintech services could, therefore, leave startups at the mercy of the service provider as they often lose control over the quality and security of their fintech service.\n\nAccording to Jan Chapman, Co-founder and Managing Director of MSP Blueshift, \u201cwhen a startup outsources its fintech services, it is often required to share sensitive data with its service provider. This can put the startup\u2019s data at risk and expose it to fraud or identity theft. The startup may also be limited in its ability to control how its data is used and may not have the same level of security as it would if it developed its fintech platform.\u201d\n\nIncreased regulatory oversights\n\nProviding FaaS services to startups would see Flutterwave dealing with data from the businesses that sign up and could open it up to increased regulatory oversight.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely possibilities of more regulatory oversights in niche cases, especially if it involves private data, but generally, standardisation and provision of FaaS through APIs means that there is more compliance built right from the go,\u201d says Rafiq Lightwala, Founder of Investify, a Pakistani fintech startup.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s FaaS offering is a welcome development for startups that may need to ride on its infrastructure, it could also throw up quality control, regulatory, and security issues. However, going by some of its appointments in the past year, the startup seems prepared for problems that may arise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRussian military activity in eastern Ukraine has increased recently, with threats of a larger invasion looming. Russia\u2019s President, Vladimir Putin, has unequivocally stated that Ukraine has no historical claim to independence; on Monday, February 21, 2022, he said that modern Ukraine was \u201centirely created by Russia.\u201d\n\nAnd on Thursday, February 24, 2022, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, potentially igniting a European war over Russia\u2019s demands for an end to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s (NATO) eastward expansion.\n\nBut what could have caused the conflict? While tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, had existed for some time, the situation began to spiral out of control in early 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urged US president, Joe Biden, to allow Ukraine to join NATO in January of last year. This infuriated Russia, which began sending troops near its Ukrainian border for \u201ctraining exercises\u201d and increased the number of troops sent in 2021.\n\nSadly, 14,000 people have died in Ukraine since 2014; I\u2019m sure many more will perish if caution is not exercised. Plus, I think this conflict has the potential to spark World War III. Do you think so? Leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\nBalancing the pain points of privacy and profits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe European Union (EU) data protection laws have long been regarded as the \u201cgold standard\u201d globally. Nonetheless, because technology has changed our lives in ways no one could have predicted in the last 25 years, the rules must be rewritten.\n\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2016, one of its most significant achievements in recent years. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Directive, enacted when the Internet was in its infancy.\n\nAnd over the last four years, some progress has been made in protecting personal data since the GDPR was implemented.\n\nLarge technology companies have come under intense scrutiny. Due to the current invasive nature of data tracking and its application to advertising and marketing, they have had to backtrack and seek ways to protect user privacy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, Facebook and Google are under increasing pressure to better balance privacy and ad targeting, with their fortunes on the line as users revolt, regulators loom, and Apple seizes the opportunity to improve its image.\n\nPer Statista, 97% of apps on the Google Play Store are free as of December 2021; that figure is 94% on the Apple App Store.\n\nBut is Apple more secure than Google in terms of privacy?\n\nResearch shows that an iPhone or an Android device constantly sends data to Apple or Google, including your location, phone number, and local network details.\n\nSo, how do Google and Apple strike a balance between privacy concerns and profit motives? In the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo covered and provided more insight into this.\n\nPlease read the article here, The Google/Apple dilemma: Balancing the pain points of privacy and profit\n\nDecline in the cryptocurrency market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian president, Vladimir Putin, launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022, and explosions have been reported in the country\u2019s east.\n\nWhy should you care? The cryptocurrency market has fallen sharply as the war in Ukraine escalated, with missiles continuing to pour down on the country\u2019s capital, Kyiv, and its airport being captured by airborne troops.\n\nThe missile reports have weighed heavily on cryptocurrencies, causing a selling hysteria that has resulted in a loss of nearly $500 million in liquidations for the entire crypto market as of the time of writing.\n\nAccording to CoinGlass data, $462.91 million in cryptocurrency has been \u2018rekt\u2019 \u2013 financially lost \u2013 since two nights ago, Wednesday, February 23, 2022. Also, the crypto market is down more than 10%, as many altcoins have suffered significant losses.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order occurred on Bitfinex, where LINK \u2013 an Ethereum token \u2013 worth $3.21 million was liquidated. During the sell-off, Bitcoin and Ethereum lost $129.95 million and $116.68 million, respectively.\n\nRecall that the flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Russia\u2019s stock markets experienced a \u201cbloodbath\u201d at the start of the trading session on February 24, 2022.\n\nThe crash occurred as investors reacted to Western governments\u2019 promised sanctions in response to Putin\u2019s shocking announcement that Russia had launched military action against Ukraine.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow Do We Take Care of Our Mental Health at Work?

          "text": "In the same week Nigerians woke up to news of the arrest of Abba Kyari, a deputy commissioner of police, over his involvement in drug trafficking, Flutterwave, a Nigerian-founded fintech company, announced it had raised $250 million Series D fund from investors.\n\nWhile Kyari\u2019s arrest by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) spotlights the bad image Nigeria continues to get globally as a result of corruption and fraud, Flutterwave with its record $3 billion valuation paints a different picture of a country with young people with bright minds rewriting the future.\n\nThe rise of the Nigerian tech ecosystem, therefore, is not only demonstrated in the growing number of foreign investors\u2019 cheques chasing innovative startups, but it is also a story of new sets of global ambassadors with a laptop and their creative minds and pushing the image of the country away from corruption and poverty.\n\n\u201cCompanies like Flutterwave help boost the ecosystem\u2019s standing across various heuristics.

And with Flutterwave becoming a unicorn several times over, it catalyses action positively \u2013 partnerships, expansions and the most important, capital.\u201d\n\nMany years ago, the job of creating a positive image for the country was mostly shouldered by sportsmen and women. The prowess of the Super Eagles and sports, in general, used to be the counterbalance for Nigeria\u2019s image of corruption around the world.\n\nAs many Nigerians who frequently travelled out reported, the country\u2019s default image ambassadors were sportsmen like Austin Okocha, Daniel Amokachi, Kanu Nwankwo, Rashidi Yekini, Chioma Ajunwa, to mention but a few.\n\nBut the dwindling fortunes of sports in the country over the years alongside a persistent rise in corrupt vices has meant that there was a gap waiting to be filled. Nollywood and the music industry for all their growing popularity have not been able to fill the void. This is why the growth of the technology ecosystem in Nigeria has become a bragging point for many government officials when chasing foreign investment abroad.\n\nThe new image of Nigeria now has the pictures of innovators, founders and funders like Mitchell Elegbe of Interswitch; Olugbenga Agboola of Flutterwave; Shola Akinlade of Paystack; Iyinoluwa Aboyeji of Future Africa; Kola Aina of Ventures Platform; Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest; Omobola Johnson of TLcom; Victor Asemota of AnD Capital, among many others.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave\u2019s Nigeria founders creating and leading the most valuable African startup now worth billions of dollars, we have seen newfound respect for Nigerian founders and Nigerian business people in general all over. The numbers Flutterwave has declared also show the magnitude of the Nigerian and African opportunities,\u201d notes Victor Asemota, growth partner, AnD Ventures.\n\nAli Isa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, while speaking with BusinessDay in Saudi Arabia, during the LEAP22 Tech Conference, acknowledged using the popularity of the ecosystem in Nigeria to try to woo investors into the country.\n\nAccording to him, many of the investors are eager to come because Nigeria is now a model for tech in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here, the first meeting we had they were surprised that today in Nigeria we have five successful unicorns and many are still coming,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 22, 2022, Pantami took the entire leadership of the Ministry of Communications and Communications including leaders of the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) and National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to visit the offices of companies like Flutterwave and Treepz (former Plentywaka).\n\nCollins Onuegbu, vice chairman of Signal Alliance Group, pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s image laundering by the tech industry is driven by hard numbers; the amount of money raised by startups and the number of unicorns created.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a big market that has underwhelmed the world for decades. The new generation of startups is perhaps our hope that we can create a productive economy not based on a rent culture and corruption that Nigeria has been known for,\u201d Onuegbu said.\n\nBeyond the impressive numbers, there are also countries jostling to tap talents from the ecosystem. This is seen in the rise in the number of countries creating visas to lure startups, the number of international accelerators, and early-stage investors who are choosing Nigeria in their African strategy.\n\nIn January 2022, Germany announced that it plans to attract 400,000 skilled workers from abroad each year to tackle both a demographic imbalance and labour shortages in key sectors that risk undermining the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The United Kingdom and Canada already have such plans and have been welcoming a lot of Nigerian tech talents relocating to their territories.\n\nTech companies in the United States and the United Kingdom have been actively poaching talents from Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. Some of these companies are Revolut, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Palantir, Delivery Hero, Uber, etc.\n\n\u201cThis however heightens the competition for software engineering talent on the ground, with incumbent financial services firms often left with the short end of the stick,\u201d said Adesoji Solanke, director, frontier, Sub-Saharan Africa Banks, and Fintechs, Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe talent recruitment from Nigeria also raises concerns that the country\u2019s brain drain problem is increasing. Solanke has a different view.\n\n\u201cGrowing digitization of the economy improves the government\u2019s chances of taxing the informal economy, which helps improve their revenue to GDP ratios. What would be good to see is a reversal of the brain drain on the continent, which is largely a function of the quality of governance at the national level, as well as economic and monetary policy,\u201d Solanke said.\n\nDuring a presentation in 2021, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, referenced Gidi Mobile, an edtech startup in Nigeria founded by Adetunji Adegbesan, as an example of innovative companies solving problems in Africa.\n\n\u201cA lot of VCs and angel investors are always wondering why the Nigerian ecosystem is growing fast and robustly at that,\u201d says Adedeji Olowe, CEO of Trium, a venture capital builder, saying, \u201cThey are also very impressed with the value creation of Nigerian startup founders as well. We just deliver.\u201d\n\nNigerian tech companies raised over $1.2 billion in 2021, making them the most attractive startups on the continent. Experts project that the numbers will be exceeded in 2022.\n\nAt a recent event in February, Abiola Gbemisola, assistant manager, Equity Research, FBNQuest, noted that the ecosystem in Africa had already seen over $500 million already raised in the market between January and February.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this run rate at the end of the year, we will probably be looking at $10 billion for the African continent, which is two times more than what we have raised in 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nAgain, Nigeria is expected to dominate investment this year on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s $250 million Series D is the largest funding raised so far in 2022 and the second-largest funding by a tech startup in less than one year. OPay, another Nigeria-founded company, still holds the record of largest investment by a startup with its $400 million funding last year that valued the company at over $1 billion and giving it a seat on the Nigeria unicorns table. The other unicorns \u2013 companies valued at over $1 billion \u2013 include Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, and Jumia.\n\nNonetheless, Olaoluwa Samuel-Biyi, co-founder of SureGroup, says the impact of the achievement by the ecosystem is not as visible to most Nigerians travelling abroad as should be expected. This is because the tech and venture community is still closed and not very mainstream.\n\n\u201cNigerians still have a huge image problem to deal with abroad, and our success in technology and venture financing can only go so far to influence mainstream perception,\u201d said Samuel-Biyi. \u201cOur music industry has done much better in that regard.\u201d\n\nWhile taking an Uber in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Temitayo Daniel, a Nigerian tech professional, recalls hearing a song by Davido being played by one of the radio stations. Although it made him feel proud to be Nigerian, he says music has not had the same impact on Nigeria\u2019s global image as the tech industry. Foreigners are not just admiring the growth of the tech industry, they are eagerly signing cheques to be part of the party. Nigeria also dominates global accelerator programmes like Silicon Valley\u2019s Y Combinator and Toronto\u2019s Techstars when it comes to African selection.\n\nRead also: Demand for African developers by tech industry at all-time high \u2013 Google report\n\nHe also noted that the growth of tech startups in Nigeria has given them opportunities to own stages at global events like the Web Summit, in Lisbon and LEAP in Riyadh.\n\nBack home, experts say the positive image is helping reshape the economy. The ecosystem is now one of the industries creating massive job opportunities for young Nigerians. They have also removed barriers to overseas investments as well as positioned businesses from the country to attract foreign capital. Adedeji Olowe adds that the tech industry has also created a new generation of wealthy Nigerians.\n\nNevertheless, there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the impact of the tech industry impacts more Nigerians. One of them will be to remove the friction between founders and government authorities.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between tech players and government is still adversarial by default, and until that changes to something more positively symbiotic, there will always be that distance between stakeholders,\u201d Samuel-Biyi said. \u201cTech has however succeeded at improving economic outcomes at the individual level, which inevitably translates to some degree of economic growth. If this can be channeled purposefully by the government, it could become a major driver of growth.\u201d",

The numbers Flutterwave has declared also show the magnitude of the Nigerian and African opportunities,\u201d notes Victor Asemota, growth partner, AnD Ventures.\n\nAli Isa Pantami, minister of communications and digital economy, while speaking with BusinessDay in Saudi Arabia, during the LEAP22 Tech Conference, acknowledged using the popularity of the ecosystem in Nigeria to try to woo investors into the country.\n\nAccording to him, many of the investors are eager to come because Nigeria is now a model for tech in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhen I came here, the first meeting we had they were surprised that today in Nigeria we have five successful unicorns and many are still coming,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 22, 2022, Pantami took the entire leadership of the Ministry of Communications and Communications including leaders of the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) and National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to visit the offices of companies like Flutterwave and Treepz (former Plentywaka).\n\nCollins Onuegbu, vice chairman of Signal Alliance Group, pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s image laundering by the tech industry is driven by hard numbers; the amount of money raised by startups and the number of unicorns created.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a big market that has underwhelmed the world for decades. The new generation of startups is perhaps our hope that we can create a productive economy not based on a rent culture and corruption that Nigeria has been known for,\u201d Onuegbu said.\n\nBeyond the impressive numbers, there are also countries jostling to tap talents from the ecosystem. This is seen in the rise in the number of countries creating visas to lure startups, the number of international accelerators, and early-stage investors who are choosing Nigeria in their African strategy.\n\nIn January 2022, Germany announced that it plans to attract 400,000 skilled workers from abroad each year to tackle both a demographic imbalance and labour shortages in key sectors that risk undermining the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. The United Kingdom and Canada already have such plans and have been welcoming a lot of Nigerian tech talents relocating to their territories.\n\nTech companies in the United States and the United Kingdom have been actively poaching talents from Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. Some of these companies are Revolut, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Palantir, Delivery Hero, Uber, etc.\n\n\u201cThis however heightens the competition for software engineering talent on the ground, with incumbent financial services firms often left with the short end of the stick,\u201d said Adesoji Solanke, director, frontier, Sub-Saharan Africa Banks, and Fintechs, Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe talent recruitment from Nigeria also raises concerns that the country\u2019s brain drain problem is increasing. Solanke has a different view.\n\n\u201cGrowing digitization of the economy improves the government\u2019s chances of taxing the informal economy, which helps improve their revenue to GDP ratios. What would be good to see is a reversal of the brain drain on the continent, which is largely a function of the quality of governance at the national level, as well as economic and monetary policy,\u201d Solanke said.\n\nDuring a presentation in 2021, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, referenced Gidi Mobile, an edtech startup in Nigeria founded by Adetunji Adegbesan, as an example of innovative companies solving problems in Africa.\n\n\u201cA lot of VCs and angel investors are always wondering why the Nigerian ecosystem is growing fast and robustly at that,\u201d says Adedeji Olowe, CEO of Trium, a venture capital builder, saying, \u201cThey are also very impressed with the value creation of Nigerian startup founders as well. We just deliver.\u201d\n\nNigerian tech companies raised over $1.2 billion in 2021, making them the most attractive startups on the continent. Experts project that the numbers will be exceeded in 2022.\n\nAt a recent event in February, Abiola Gbemisola, assistant manager, Equity Research, FBNQuest, noted that the ecosystem in Africa had already seen over $500 million already raised in the market between January and February.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this run rate at the end of the year, we will probably be looking at $10 billion for the African continent, which is two times more than what we have raised in 2021,\u201d he said.\n\nAgain, Nigeria is expected to dominate investment this year on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s $250 million Series D is the largest funding raised so far in 2022 and the second-largest funding by a tech startup in less than one year. OPay, another Nigeria-founded company, still holds the record of largest investment by a startup with its $400 million funding last year that valued the company at over $1 billion and giving it a seat on the Nigeria unicorns table. The other unicorns \u2013 companies valued at over $1 billion \u2013 include Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, and Jumia.\n\nNonetheless, Olaoluwa Samuel-Biyi, co-founder of SureGroup, says the impact of the achievement by the ecosystem is not as visible to most Nigerians travelling abroad as should be expected. This is because the tech and venture community is still closed and not very mainstream.\n\n\u201cNigerians still have a huge image problem to deal with abroad, and our success in technology and venture financing can only go so far to influence mainstream perception,\u201d said Samuel-Biyi. \u201cOur music industry has done much better in that regard.\u201d\n\nWhile taking an Uber in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Temitayo Daniel, a Nigerian tech professional, recalls hearing a song by Davido being played by one of the radio stations. Although it made him feel proud to be Nigerian, he says music has not had the same impact on Nigeria\u2019s global image as the tech industry. Foreigners are not just admiring the growth of the tech industry, they are eagerly signing cheques to be part of the party. Nigeria also dominates global accelerator programmes like Silicon Valley\u2019s Y Combinator and Toronto\u2019s Techstars when it comes to African selection.\n\nRead also: Demand for African developers by tech industry at all-time high \u2013 Google report\n\nHe also noted that the growth of tech startups in Nigeria has given them opportunities to own stages at global events like the Web Summit, in Lisbon and LEAP in Riyadh.\n\nBack home, experts say the positive image is helping reshape the economy. The ecosystem is now one of the industries creating massive job opportunities for young Nigerians. They have also removed barriers to overseas investments as well as positioned businesses from the country to attract foreign capital. Adedeji Olowe adds that the tech industry has also created a new generation of wealthy Nigerians.\n\nNevertheless, there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure that the impact of the tech industry impacts more Nigerians. One of them will be to remove the friction between founders and government authorities.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between tech players and government is still adversarial by default, and until that changes to something more positively symbiotic, there will always be that distance between stakeholders,\u201d Samuel-Biyi said. \u201cTech has however succeeded at improving economic outcomes at the individual level, which inevitably translates to some degree of economic growth. If this can be channeled purposefully by the government, it could become a major driver of growth.\u201d",

          "text": "In 2012, Mike Butcher of TechCrunch wrote an article on the African tech scene that caused a lot of backlash. He said: \u201cThe consensus on the ground among seasoned AfricaTech watchers is that while Nigeria has the fastest growing economy, it\u2019s also pretty dangerous at the moment.\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of negative news about Nigeria at the time, as terrorism had just gained full steam. We tried to correct the impression in many online conversations and explained that the violence was limited to remote parts of the country. It was an uphill task as people were wary.\n\nMike Butcher and others were right about one thing, Nigeria was the fastest growing economy, and we also had (and still have) a very young population coming into adulthood. The shifting demographic was a massive opportunity as older institutions could not meet new market demand.\n\nThey could not innovate quickly enough to provide unique products. It was a great place to start and test new ideas. We had the fastest-growing African population at the time, and launching internet companies to serve the market became almost inevitable.\n\nNigeria defied the stereotypes. In 2012, launching a $10 million fund for startups in East Africa was a big deal and a newsworthy item on Techcrunch. Still, 10 years later, we have a Nigerian startup raising hundreds of millions of dollars and now worth $3 billion. That is impressive progress in 10 years by any standard. The story is only just beginning, and as Jeff Bezos of Amazon keeps saying \u2013 it is still Day 1.\n\nThe journey\n\nNigeria\u2019s tech startup journey started decades before 2012 but experienced several discontinuities. Each time there were economic challenges and currency devaluation, a massive brain drain followed. Many talented people who could have built impactful companies all moved abroad. I left twice myself and returned.\n\nVery few people remember that Nigeria\u2019s Tara Systems once built a core banking platform called Microbanker implemented widely outside the country and in many American banks. SocketWorks Global (the first venture-funded startup in Nigeria and possibly Sub-Saharan Africa) built C-Portal, used in universities as far away as Sri Lanka.\n\nA country already exporting software over two decades ago always lost the edge each time there was economic hardship. This problem left our market wide open for others to capture with software products. We still import a lot of software today despite all the recent progress we have made. It is still Day 1 in Nigeria.\n\nOne of the best things to happen to Nigerian tech two decades before Flutterwave became a Unicorn was the deregulation of the telecommunications sector and licensing of GSM companies. These companies transformed our national infrastructure and created more jobs and possibilities. We built entirely new businesses now employing millions today because of that regulation.\n\nLicensing of telcos was one of the most consequential regulatory interventions that helped the progress of Nigerian technology.\n\nIt opened the market for digital products like Blackberry and others at scale, and it also made it possible for a young person like Elvis Chidera to learn how to code just from his phone. Many things became possible as connectivity to the Internet also became ubiquitous.\n\nBank consolidation created more viable players who invested heavily in technology for their operations. Banking and payments also benefited from favorable regulations and interventions. Electronic payments industry guidelines by the Central Bank of Nigeria allowed organizations like Interswitch and NIBSS to emerge. The problem was that all of these organizations still broadly used foreign software products.\n\nThe founders of Flutterwave worked in banking and saw the opportunity for new locally built products to serve our fast-growing economy better. After launch, they were so successful that many doubted that the figures they revealed were accurate. They are authentic and have only grown. We did the seemingly impossible and built a company from zero to $3 billion in just six years.\n\nFlutterwave didn\u2019t do it alone; regulation was very helpful in creating the standards that made investors confident enough to invest in it and others. It also helped to instill confidence in the market.\n\nThe future\n\nThe story of Flutterwave has been nothing but fantastic. I still remember when the founders were conserving money and couldn\u2019t travel to events to meet potential customers or partners. I saw them grind from the beginning and work hard to win each new deal. That philosophy of pragmatism still drives them today, and it has been the bedrock of their success.\n\nThe success of Flutterwave has created more than a buzz in the market. Many investors (including the largest Fintech investor in the world) now have local teams after Flutterwave announced their Unicorn round last year.\n\nFor those of us who have been investing locally in the last decade and are fortunate to be associated with this success and tremendous growth, it is also still year 1. There is more to come.\n\nAsemota is a technology entrepreneur and investor who serves as a board member and advisor to leading fintech and investment firms across Africa and globally. He is Board Chair for EdoInnovates, Growth Partner at AnD Ventures, Advisory Board Member at ARM DFS and a member of many other technology startup boards. He is also a Board Advisor to Flutterwave",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has urged stakeholders to support government policies on forest regeneration.\n\nAddressing stakeholders during a workshop at the Government House in Benin City, the governor said the state government will strengthen collaboration with stakeholders including timber and lorry owners, sawmillers and others to tackle illegality in the state\u2019s forestry sector.\n\n\u201cOur forest is now full of lawlessness as people just cut down trees anyhow, bribe authorities and continue with their normal life. We have a drug problem in the state as 57,000 hectares of our forest as of today is now used to cultivate cannabis. We used to have forest guards which are long forgotten. We must bring them back to help us guard and protect our forest,\u201d he noted.\n\nObaseki said, \u201cWe have neglected the forest and left it in a bad shape. If those that came before us consumed and treated the forest badly this way, we would not have met the forest.\u201d\n\nThe closure of the forest, according to the governor, was not done to punish anybody, but in the best interest of stakeholders and to improve the forestry sector to enable it contribute meaningfully to the development of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou all voted for me to govern Edo State and whatever we are doing is for the benefit of all of us. We have to be responsible to our forest. Forestry will not be under any ministry but on its own to be able to function effectively and efficiently. We want to govern this sector properly. We must update the law guiding forestry. We can\u2019t operate in 2022 with an outdated law of 1930 or 1940.\n\n\u201cWe must take our policy seriously and implement it to get a good and better result. We have to bring in experts to help us secure our forest. Our focus should now be how to regulate those who play in the forestry space and ensure we use qualified persons, focusing on bringing investors into the state to invest in the forest and protect it against criminal elements.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cWe must come together to contribute to fund the forestry commission. We are open for discussions and in a hurry to reopen the forest for business. We must grow a minimum of one million trees a year to save and preserve the forest or else we won\u2019t have any business for the next 10 years. It is important if we want to have a business doing forestry.\u201d\n\nIn his opening remark, the the Edo State Commissioner for Environment and Sustainability, Hon.

          "title": "Outcome of 2014 Jonathan\u2019s conference best for Nigeria \u2014 Olumo, Oyo OPC coordinator",
          "text": "Comrade Rotimi Olumo is the coordinator of the Odua Peoples Congress (Gani Adams) in Oyo State. He played a prominent role in curbing the invasion of the Fulani herders terrorising the people of Oke Ogun and Ibarapa areas of Oyo State.\n\nIn this Interview with Olusesan Laoye of the BusinessHallmark, he spoke about how his command has been combating crime, what the government should do on security, how Amotekun would be effective and efforts being made to secure Lagos Ibadan express way to guarantee the safety of commuters on the road.\n\nHe also spoke on 2014 National conference and agitations for self determinations by various ethnic groups Nigeria.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWhat has OPC and other security agents been doing to curtail the activities of bandits and Fulani herdsmen said to be terrorising the people of the South West, particularly, Oyo State?\n\nWe have been able to curtail the activities of bandits, and.other criminals and reduce rate of kidnapping, through the efforts and stern directive from our leader Iba Gami Adams, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, who has been in firm control of operations in the region.\n\nAs the generalisimo of the Yoruba people, Gani Adam\u2019s is always an advocate of adapting other means of securing the South West.\n\nAs a result, he has always been on the neck of all his coordinators and encouraging them not to relax and ensure that criminals in their areas are fished out and handed over to the law enforcement agencies for further actions. We do this without taking laws into our hands.\n\nThe collaboration of the OPC with the South West governors and constant meeting being held with them by Iba Gani Adams, also helped to boost our morale to work for the security of the region. To have directions on securing the region, all the coordinators attend weekly meetings presided over by our leader Gani Adams. I can even say that constant Interactions with the Governors by Gani Adams was in a way instrumental to the formation of the Amotekun Corps in the South West.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I would say Amotekun should be regarded as the baby of Gani Adams.\n\nThe cooperation between the OPC, Amotekun and other local security outfits, such as Agbekoya and the hunters Association, has helped in getting the South West secure. I want to say as well, that OPC did a lot on the issue of Fulani herders in Ibarapa, with particular reference to the case of Iskilu Wakilu, which led to the arrest of our men and this made the whole world to come out to defend the injustice meted to those who carried out the arrest.\n\nThe operations of Amotekun by using light weapons also contributed to why we have few cases of banditry in the South West because they can now use the weapons to face criminals.\n\nOn the issue of Lagos-Ibadan Express way, in which kidnapping was recently experienced, the OPC, Amotekun and other security operatives are working day and night and even keeping vigil to ensure the safety of commuters on the road.\n\nWith the formation of Amotekun and the cooperation enjoyed with other local security outfits and considering the wave of crimes in the country, don\u2019t you think there is now the need for State police?\n\nHonesty, I support State police.There is also nothing wrong in community policing because there are more criminals now all over Nigeria. There is no efforts too much to guarantee security of lives and properties. If the state and community police are established, the conventional police should see them as complementary to their efforts and not as competitors.\n\nI believed that if Nigeria is well protected, and there is adequate security, the economy of the country would improve and Nigeria would attract more investors both foreign and local. It would even help the growth of investments and jobs would be created.\n\nAdequate security would also help farmers who are now going to farms with the fear of being attacked to concentrate on their farming, which would guarantee sufficient food production and other agro allied raw materials for our manufacturing industries.\n\nHow can we curtail thuggery during the coming political activities in Nigeria and the youths being used by politicians to foment trouble?\n\nPoliticians now need to be warned.They should know that politics is not to be used to cause trouble, wreck havock or to destabilise the country but for development. The problem with Nigerian politicians is that they are selfish; they think about themselves alone without even considering the fact that they were brought to that position by the people who elected them.\n\nThe crises experienced all over Nigeria during elections are caused by politicians who engage youths as thugs.They empower them with weapons to protect them and these thugs later turn around to use the weapons to cause havoc. These time around, we in the OPC and other local security networks are determined not to allow these unscrupulous people and their masters to destabilise the country, especially the South West.\n\nWe are ready for them because we believe that any serious politician who wants to serve should not engage in thuggery and violence to achieve his ambition. We are going to do our best on our side but we are appealing to the government to put up machineries that will curb thuggery and violence during campaigns so that lives and properties would not be wasted.\n\nWhat are your views on the agitations for restructuring?\n\nI think the problems we are having now on the agitations for restructuring and self determination, are as a result of non implementation of the 2014 National conference organized by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe conference was the best thing offered Nigerians during the tenure of that President but we wasted it.\n\nIt was a conference which should have solved all the problems we are facing now.\n\nIt was a conference where the best in Nigeria put heads together to fashion a good report that favoured all sections of Nigeria. The hope then, was that if the report was implemented, it would cement the unity of the country because it more or less favoured restructuring and we are not going to be in the present mess we have found ourselves.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, the present federal government made the greatest mistake of not implementing the out- come of that confab because if it had done it, the issue of Boko Haram, banditry and other vices causing insecurity would not have been so rampant because all sections of the country and zones, would have found ways and means of securing their areas.\n\nBy now, the issue of state or regional police would have been resolved and Nigeria would have been a secure nation. The issue at stake now, is that people are no longer talking about restructuring. To many geopolitical zones, the issue of restructuring is now belated. That is why in the South West they are clamouring for Oduduwa nation, in the south East Biafra, the South South people too want to be independent. The impression is that if they are independent there would be a lot of development in their areas with the policies that would be initiated.\n\nWith your stand on self-determination, what do you want to say about Sunday Igboho on his stand for Odua Republic?\n\nWell, in the first place Sunday Igboho came out as a brave person when there was too much cry over uncertainty about the lives of his people being attacked and raped by the Fulani herdsmen, who graduated into kidnappers terrorized the people.\n\nHe came out when the appropriate authorities failed to bail his people out of their predicaments. To me, I don\u2019t think Sunday Igboho has committed any crime but the power that be, turned the case of his agitation against him.\n\nWith the situation of things now, I think what all the people in Yorubaland including all the traditional rulers should do now, is to rally round him, to guarantee his freedom because Igboho was not fighting for himself but the entire Yoruba nation.\n\nAs the coordinator of the OPC in Oyo State, what are the things you did to change the bad behaviours of your members and activities?\n\nWhat I did was to give them new orientations through seminars and workshops. I also brought what I learnt from our leader Gani Adams into my operations. This made the organisation in the state to be rebranded. What I also did was to tell our people to find jobs to do and encouraged those who have their school certificate to go back to higher institutions.\n\nEven as the coordinator I too have gone back to school. I am now doing my HND in Public Administration. Majority of our members are no more illiterates but highly educated, which has made OPC a rebranded organisation.",

          "title": "Tension in Osun as PDP holds governorship primary",
          "text": "By OLUSESAN LAOYE\n\nOsun State is still very tensed politically and for the past few weeks, the political atmosphere has been uncertain, which has made the people of the state to continue living in fear after the All Progressives Congress governorship primary (APC).\n\nThe citizens who just went through a serious trauma with the primary of the APC, is now into another which has been envisaged that would be more tempestuous than that of the APC, with the volatile manner the members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), set for their primary to pick who would slug it out with the incumbent, Governor Gboyega Oyetola, are conducting themselves.\n\nWhat gave clear impression that the PDP primary would be volatile was demonstrated during the ward congress to pick delegates that would vote at the primary on March 8, 2022.\n\nThe ward congress was marred with violence from thugs which led to deaths in Iwo and Odootin local governments of the state. Already the two camps of both Demola Adeleke and Akin Ogunbiyi have been trading verbal tackles over the incidents.\n\nUnlike its rival political party, which had two hot contenders for its primary, the PDP is parading five heavy weights contesting the ticket for the governorship election in July this year.\n\nThey are Ademola Adeleke, who claimed he is the front runner, Akin Ogunbiyi who is confident that whatever the case may be, this time around, he would block all avenues that they may want to use to rig him out, as it was done four years ago.\n\nAlso, in the battle are Alhaji Fatai Akinbade, former Secretary to the the Osun state government during the tenure of former governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola, Sanya Omirin, from Atakumosa who happens to be the only aspirant from Osun East, Dotun Babayemi, a business mogul and Dele Adeleke, the nephew of Demola Adeleke, whose entry into the race has been controversial.\n\nAlthough all the aspirants are determined, apart from Demola Adeleke and Akin Ogunbiyi, Dele Adeleke who came into the race at the last minute is another serious person to be watched. Despite his lateness, he has been making waves, making subtle house to house campaign and meeting party leaders privately.\n\nHis popularity has made the people of the state to rate him third after Ogunbiyi. Apart from the fact that Dele appeals to the youths in the state, he is said to have the support of some notable leaders both in the State and at the National level.\n\nDele is the only aspirant who never makes noise or brags like his uncle Demola, who people believed is blowing his trumpet to prove that he has overcome the controversy of so many scandals he faced four years ago. It was also alleged that as a result of his desperation to clinch the ticket of the party, he has bought delegates.\n\nThis, it was said, manifested during the adhoc shadow congress held, and most of the wards which he claimed to have won that fetched him the highest numbers of delegates, who are ready to vote for him at the venue of primary, since the PDP in Osun state is adopting indirect primary.\n\nBut his counterpart, Ogunbiyi who is also hot in the race described Demola\u2019s claim and outburst as fallacy, saying that he was only showcasing ignorance, insecurity and inferiority complex, which he has been fighting since the last governorship election in 2018.\n\nA member of the party told Business Hallmark that they believed that part of the insecurity and lack of confidence Demola Adeleke made his supporters to have attacked the former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who is so much respected.\n\nIt was said that a lot of people were bitter about the attack which led the the supporters of the former governor to protest both in Osogbo and Okuku his home town.\n\nSome of the people who also commented on the attack on Oyinlola, argued that it was a great mistake which could at the end of the day, cost him the ticket of the party despite his \u201cbragging that he is on top and the notion that he has the highest numbers of delegates who would win the primary for him.\u201d\n\nAlso, one major problem confronting the PDP is that of dual Chairmanship. While the Soji Adagunodo\u2019s group lay claim to be the most authentic, with Wale Ojo as the chairman, reaffirmed by the court, the Sunday Bisi group claimed that it is the one recognised by the National body of the party to direct the affairs in the state.\n\nThis controversy is still raging and if not resolved before March, it could pose a dangerous threat for the PDP in Osun state, which could affect the primary. This could also lead to confusion at the venue of the primary.\n\nIn his reaction, the chairman of the group affirmed by the court, said that no matter the legitimacy which may have been given to Sunday Bisi\u2019s Chairmanship, he still remains the only authentic and bonafide chairman recognised by law. According to him whatever actions carried out by anybody \u201cnot me as the chairman of the party in Osun State, is nullity.\u201d\n\nOn the attack on Oyinlola one of the associates of the former governor who confided in BusinessHallmark said that Demola has forgotten that the kind of the person of his boss is not to be rude to, as far as Osun state politics is concern.\n\nHe said he has allowed his ambition to becloud his sense of reasoning, saying \u201cwhat happened was an indication that such a disrepecful person is not fit to be placed at the saddle of affairs in a very serious state like Osun.\u201d\n\nAlso, the speculations going on is that if the supporters of Adagunodo and that of Oyinlola team up, Demola may not at the end of the day, clinch the ticket of the party. It was also said that the leader of the party in the South West, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, is not comfortable with Adeleke being the flag bearer of the party.\n\nIt was speculated that his choice is his nephew Dele, who people of the state believed is more composed, articulate and more intelligent and without controversial and ambiguous. credentials.\n\nIn its reaction on various allegations against the the team, and principal, the Ademola Adeleke Campaign Organisation condemns violence and condole with families of victims who died during the mock congress.\n\n\u201cWe are constrained to release this statement even after the state leadership of our great party has yesterday issued a strongly worded message on reported cases of violence and deaths during the recently concluded ward adhoc congress. We hereby reiterate the non-involvement of our campaign organisation in the fracas and frowns at any satanic attempt to link our organisation and principal to the incident.\n\n\u201cAs a campaign organisation committed to peaceful ethos and norms, we condemn in the strongest possible terms the unfortunate incidents at Iwo and Odo Otin local governments and commiserate with the families of the victims. We affirm that neither our campaign organisation nor our party has a hand in the sad events.\n\n\u201cOur mobilisation for the congress and forthcoming general election is premised on peoples\u2019 aspiration and love, hence we abhor violence and agents of conflict. It is on records that other political factions mobilised political thugs from neighbouring state to cause mayhem.\n\n\u201cSeveral reports of such trans-border movements were received but our organisation rather concentrated on mobilisation and several concessions to the Fintiri led National Committee to ensure the success of the ward congress.\n\n\u201cDespite the unfair attacks, this organisation remains committed to working with every members of the party for peaceful congresses and primary as well eventual victory at the state election. We are strengthened in our belief that the love of the people is the greatest asset in politics. That is what we have and Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke is the symbol of light and peace for that mass movement.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja has approved the nomination of a five man panel to serve in the the Osun State Ward Congresses Electoral Appeal Panel to consider appeals arising from the conduct of the 3 man ad-hoc delegate Ward Congresses.\n\nAccording to Hon. Debo Ologunagba the National Publicity Secretary of the party, members of the committee are\n\n1. H.E. Sen. Eyinnaya Abaribe \u2013 (Chairman)\n\n2. Dr. Steven Omeje \u2013 (Member)\n\n3. Prof. Aishatu Madawaki \u2013 (Member)\n\n4. Hon. Chief Ako Atu \u2013 (Member)\n\n5. Barr. Tanko Beji (Secretary)\n\nHon. Ologunagba stated that the exercise would hold today Monday, February 28, 2022 at the National Working Committee (NWC) Hall, Wadata Plaza, PDP National Secretariat, Abuja at 10 am and that all critical stakeholders and members of the Party in Osun State are to appear before the panel.",

          "title": "Delta 2023: Odds mount against Ibori",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nSince 1999 when the swashbuckling Londoner, James Onanefe Ibori, who had returned to Nigeria from England in the mid-90s to serve as consultant to then military head of state, General Sani Abacha, swept his way to power as governor of Delta State, aged just 39, he has maintained a firm grip on the state\u2019s politics, deciding who becomes what from governors to national assembly members and everything in between.\n\nAnd not even his long periods of incarceration in England on conviction for fraud was able to stop his control of the state\u2019s politics.\n\nIndeed, sometimes last year, a picture showing the Senator representing Delta South Senatorial District, James Manager, kneeling before Ibori who returned to the country in 2017 after being released from jail, went viral and elicited reactions from many Nigerians. It spoke to the level of influence Ibori still wields in the state.\n\nBut as Delta, and indeed Nigeria, marches towards another election cycle in 2023, Ibori\u2019s grip on the state is coming under a stern test, no thanks to the continued inroads being made by Nigeria\u2019s emergent ruling party, the All Progressive Congress (APC) into the state, the complexities of the state\u2019s politics, as well as the incumbent governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa\u2019s alleged move to chose his own successor.\n\nZoning Challenge\n\nDelta, like all states of the Nigerian federation, is made up of three senatorial zones: Delta North, the predominantly Igbo speaking Anioma areas made up of nine local governments, among which are Aniocha North, Aniocha South, Ika North, Ika South, Ndokwa East, Ndokwa West, Oshimili North, Oshimili South and Ukwuani; Delta Central, the Urhobo zone comprising of eight local governments of Ethiope East, Ethiope West, Sapele, Okpe, Ughelli North, Ughelli South, Udu and Uvwie; and Delta South, which is an admixture of Itsekiri, Ijaw, Isoko and Urhobo divided into eight local governments of Burutu, Bomadi, Isoko North, Isoko South, Patani, Warri North, Warri South and Warri South West.\n\nPower rotation has been key in maintaining a semblance of stability in the state\u2019s politics, and Ibori who is Urhobo from the Central District had handed over to his cousin, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, an Itsekiri from the Southern District, and upon the completion of his tenure in 2015, Uduaghan handed over Dr. Okowa from the Delta North.\n\nOkowa will be completing his eight years in office in 2023, and in line with the rotation structure set up by Ibori, power is billed to return to the Urhobo of the Central District. And with this in mind, Ibori is said to have since penciled down David Edevbie, his core loyalist who was his Finance Commissioner and later Principal Secretary to the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, as Okowa\u2019s successor.\n\nApart from Edevbie, who also served as Okowa\u2019s chief of staff, other Urhobo sons who are in the race within the PDP ranks are: Speaker of the state Assembly, Sheriff Oborevwori; immediate past commissioner for Works, James Augoye; businessman and former minister of State for Education, Kenneth Gbagi; former Commissioner for Justice, Peter Mr Akpor; a former commissioner, Fred Majemite; former senator and managing director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Emmanuel Aguariavwodo, among others.\n\nIndeed it\u2019s along this line of thought that prominent traditional rulers from Delta North led by the Asagba of Asaba, Chike Edozien, recently argued that it was only right for power to return to the Central Senatorial District in 2023.\n\nBut there\u2019s been a twist in the tale. The Ijaw, which make up a significant portion of the Southern Senatorial District, as well the Isoko who are also a significant group in the zone, are aggressively making a case for the coveted seat. Their argument being that since the Urhobo, the Itsekiri and the Anioma have had power, it\u2019s only right for them to do so, too. In essence, they argue that rotation should be based on ethnic groups and not senatorial zones.\n\nAt the forefront of the Ijaw quest for power are such notable figures as Chief Edwin Clark, former federal minister and leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), and importantly, Chief Government Ekpemupolo, popularly known as Tompolo, both of whom are prominent Ijaw nationals from the state.\n\nLast week, Chief Clark, in response to the position of Delta North traditional rulers, insisted that zoning doesn\u2019t exist as far as he was concerned, as according to him, every governorship election since 1999 had been contested for by people from different zones.\n\n\u201cIjaw is not campaigning for 2023 governorship that it is the turn of Delta South, we are saying that we too want to have it, that we produce most of the oil, we will like to have it, not on the condition of senatorial zone,\u201d he said in an interview with a national daily. \u201cWhat Ibori did was in abuse of his office as governor of the state and he paid dearly for it.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in a statement few months ago, Equity Group of Isoko (EGI), an Isoko pressure group urged other tribes in the state to support the Isoko bid for power in the interest of equity and fairness.\n\nThe group said in the statement signed by its coordinator, Deacon Mazno Ovadhe, that it would be unfair to rotate the state\u2019s seat of power on the basis of zones rather than ethnic groups, and on that call, he noted that the Urhobo have produced governor of the state on two occasions, with Chief Felix Ibru and Chief Ibori, while an Itsekiri man, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan has also an ruled and an Ika man, Dr. Okowa is currently the governor of the state.\n\n\u201cIf there had been any gentleman agreement by politicians in the state in rotating governorship position the Senatorial arrangement is oppressive without merit and equity. We urge other tribes in our dear state to vote enmass for an lsoko candidate, irrespective of political party,\u201d the group had said.\n\n\u201cIn fairness, Isoko, Ijaw and Aniocha who have not ruled the state, should be given the opportunity. We want to put the records straight, that, the votes of ljaw and lsoko people are one of the highest. Why should other tribes relegate these tribes to the background?\n\n\u201cWe also frown at comments credited to some Urhobo leaders that it is the turn of an Urhobo person again to become the next governor of Delta State.\u201c\n\nEGI argued that there was never any \u201cgentleman agreement\u201d in Delta State,\u201d noting that, \u2018If we have to believe, why was there interference from the Central Senatorial District in the last gubernatorial race?\n\n\u201cFor the records, when Chief James Ibori aspired to be governor of the state, his kinsmen fought for him to be governor\u2026 \u201cWe therefore, urge all stakeholders irrespective party affiliation to support an lsoko candidate.\u201d\n\nThe Urhobo who are the single largest ethnic group, are however, standing their ground, with the Urhobo Progress Union, UPU, rallying support for their quest, and Ibori their son knows he will find it difficult not to acquiesce to their demand for power. But at the same time, the Ijaw, whose three sons: Senator James Manager, currently representing Delta South under the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) platform; Deputy Governor of state, Deacon Kingsley Otuaro and former commissioner, Braduce Angozi, who are major contenders for the governorship, will present a huge headache for the former governor.\n\nVotes from the creeks inhabited predominantly by the Ijaw, have been instrumental to Ibori and PDP\u2019s successes in the state and Tompolo, who is the lord of the creeks, is said to be maintaining his ground that it is the turn of his kinsmen to produce the next governor.\n\nIbori, perhaps knowing that he is in a very tight position in this regard, had last week, for the first time since he returned to London, paid a visit to Tompolo in his home town of Oporoza, Gbaramatu Kingdom, Warri South West Council Area to negotiate with the warlord. It is unclear what the outcome of the the trip is, but it may also be difficult for Tompolo to take a position his own people would consider as betrayal.\n\nAPC on Ascendancy\n\nIn Delta, as in most of the South South, the APC is making huge inroads, and will be looking to snatch up victory in the 2023 governorship election in the state, which would mean that the era of Ibori dominance is over.\n\nIn 2019, Chief Great Ogboru, an Urhobo with significant political clout, became the APC candidate for the umpteenth time \u2013 his candidacy was eventually nullified by the court which recognized Prof. Pat Utomi as the rightful candidate \u2013 but he ultimately lost to Okowa, the incumbent PDP governor who, apart from wielding power of incumbency, had Ibori\u2019s backing.\n\nOgboru with some historical baggage could not muster up enough federal might to tip the scale in his favour, and the federal government which had allegedly negotiated Ibori\u2019s return to Nigeria in the understanding that he will use his influence to ensure peace in the restive oil rich region, may not have been keen on interfering with his territory.\n\nAhead of 2023, however, with deputy senate president, Ovie Omo-Agege, another prominent Urhobo, as its leader in the state, the APC will be hopeful of a better outing. But the party is also facing its own contradictions, with minister of state for labour, Festus Keyamo, among other party stakeholders, at loggerheads with Omo-Agege, even as it remains unlikely that the federal government will want to significantly undermine Ibori given his strategic role in guaranteeing peace in the region.\n\n\u201cIf the likes of Ogboru, Omo-Agege and so on can come together, they may be able to challenge Ibori,\u201d said a prominent journalist and political analyst from the state who craved anonymity. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see that happening. Omo-Agege is not strong enough to take on Ibori, and I don\u2019t think Abuja will want to play too much because of Ibori.\u201d\n\nOkowa Caught Between Two Allies\n\nThe outgoing governor, Dr. Okowa is an integral part of the Ibori political family. Indeed, his emergence as governor in 2015 was down to the fact that Ibori stood solidly behind him amid plots to deny the people of Delta North the governorship slot.\n\nBoth men remain very close, but Tompolo is also an ally of the governor and he is said to be favourably disposed to an Ijaw candidate, notably the deputy governor, Mr. Otuaro, and had stirred up some controversy when he was quoted to have argued against zoning in this regard. The governor is also said to be particularly opposed to the choice of Edevbie, who is Ibori\u2019s Urhobo candidate.\n\nThe above complications have led to suggestions that Okowa may be on collision course with Ibori, but that\u2019s unlikely, given their closeness, even as it\u2019s obvious that the governor doesn\u2019t have enough political clout to challenge Ibori.\n\n\u201cOkowa is caught between the Ijaw and Urhobo,\u201d said Mr. Richard Obaka, a political commentator. \u201cHis ally, Tompolo is Ijaw. Tom is also Ibori\u2019s ally, so it\u2019s a complex situation. But what is clear is that Okowa and Ibori will eventually reach an agreement.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Ukraine war: Nigerians miss out on oil windfall, as fuel price hike looms",
          "text": "By Uche Chris\n\nWar and international geo-political crises have always brought huge benefits to oil producing countries in the past as supply embargoes and production quota shortfalls drive price over the roof. Nigeria as a member of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, has profited immensely from those crises in the past, such as the Arab-Israeli war, Iraq-Iran war, Gulf war, etc but the current Ukraine war presents Nigeria with a dilemma, and may produce adverse outcome.\n\nAs expected, the war has spiked oil price but Nigeria is worse off and not in a position to reap dividends from it. Nigeria\u2019s production has stagnated in the past several years and the country can no longer meet its quota of OPEC by raising its current output, but it is also buffeted by the rising oil price which affects Nigerians, who may soon pay more in pump price of fuel as price of imported fuel sky-rockets.\n\nOil price has topped $100 per barrel since last week, which has doubled government subsidy and vitiating the proposed budget of N2.5 trillion for the next one year. The situation has left government scratching its head and confused about how to sustain the present subsidy regime. Sources in government believed that the N2.5 trillion is now inadequate for the subsidy given the price level of over $100 per barrel as the Ukraine war rages.\n\nExperts insist that the subsidy can only subsist at a crude price of between $60 and $70 per barrel beyond which Nigeria subsidy could increase. Already, the price of diesel and kerosene, which are is unregulated have almost doubled in the past one month. For instance, diesel now sells for N420 per litre from N320, while kerosene rose from N280 to N350.\n\nLast week, minister of state for petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva disclosed that the Nigerian government is unhappy with the high price of crude oil at the international market as it comes with other high costs for the country. Sylva told journalists in Abuja that the government was working to improve Nigeria\u2019s low oil production level.\n\nThe Minister who was speaking ahead of the 2022 Nigeria International Energy Summit (N.I.E.S), explained that high oil prices would also attract shale producers in the United States. During the meeting Nigeria and Iran opposed attempt by the group to raise quota to mitigate price in response to Western economies\u2019 concern to prevent economic crisis through energy inflation.\n\nHe said: \u201cOnce oil prices go up to a certain point, you\u2019re encouraging a lot of products that will otherwise not be in the market. So we are not happy when prices go to a certain level. We believe that prices should be at a certain point, which will be optimal for us to make sub-optimal for the shale producers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we like to have that balance right here in Nigeria as well. You know that we are right now a net importer of petroleum products. And when the price of crude is up it also affects the price of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cSo for us as a net importer, it\u2019s not very good for us. But of course, in a way what we are saying is if we are going to produce more and you get more dollars from your production they give you more money for your inputs.\n\n\u201cSo at the end of the day, we are not necessarily making a lot of gains because we are taking from the high prices. We\u2019re also importing higher priced products. And on the other side, we\u2019re also encouraging producers who should not be producing to produce which of course neutralizes the market for us.\u201d\n\nAlready, NNPC has made a proposal to raise fuel price before the end of the subsidy period. Recently NNPC issued a new directive to marketers in the sector that they will pay more for marine charges An inside source within the sector said marketers have already concluded on increasing the pump price of fuel.\n\nPart of the letter seen by the newspaper read: \u201cPlease be informed that the NNPC Management has directed that effective 10th February 2022, the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Naira, (N500,000.00) only will be charged for STS Coordination fee for each transshipment operation involving NNPC Marine Logistics.\n\nThis amount is to cover manpower and logistics required for coordination and production of cargo documents for the transshipment operations. \u201cA remita payment request will be generated by our accounts section for each operation to effect necessary payment upon the vessels tendering notice of Readiness, NOR.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cNMDPRA and NNPC have both stated the federal government\u2019s reluctance to review pump price but since they have passed them to marketers, the latter will reflect it either ex-depot or at the price.\n\nOn the 2022 NEIS which is opening in Abuja on Monday, he said about 5,000 participants are expected, adding that \u201cthe objective of the summit from inception is to deliver the biggest and best African Petroleum Technology and Business Conference that will be the definitive platform, not just for Nigeria, but also for Africa to engage the global.\n\nThis comes also against the back drop of production shortfalls, which had persisted in the past five years as a result of declining investment and oil theft through vandalism. Nigeria\u2019s OPEC quota for the year 2022 is 2.66m barrels per day, which was recently raised to 2.74 barrel per day at the January in response to pressure from consumer countries to mitigate high price.\n\nDecember monthly oil monitoring report, MOMR, showed that Nigeria\u2019s output was lower at 1.19 mbpd than 1.2 mbpd in November 2021. Nigeria was supposed to produce under OPEC quota of 1.66 mbpd in January and 1.7 m in February 2022 but has been stock at less than 1.5 m since last year. The oil output benchmark for the 2022 budget is 2.8 mbpd, which experts have described as too optimistic.\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria recorded a production deficit of 200 million barrels per year, which at $50 per barrel amount to about $10 billion. Nigeria\u2019s rig count dropped further from seven to six by December against the 10 rigs that were active in the third quarter of 2021. This followed rising divestment by international oil companies, IOCs, rising cost of exploration in deep waters, frequent oil spills, and vandalism, which cost the country $3.5 billion in revenue.\n\nAccording to the report, OPEC is expected to raise output by four million in 2022 to a total of 100 mbpd. However, Nigeria is not likely to benefit from this production increase as a result of its production challenges that have constrained its capacity to meet its official Opec quota. Experts believe that it is this production hiccups that are responsible for the revenue pressures on government compelling it to resort to uncontrollable borrowing.\n\nNigeria\u2019s revenue pressures have been compounded by the postponement of removal of fuel subsidy by 18 months, initially slated for June 2022, as contained in Petroleum Industry Act of 2021. With oil price approaching $100 per barrel the cost of importation of petroleum product is consequently expected to rise. Already the pump price of diesel and kerosene have jumped from N320 and N280 per litre respectively in January to N450 and N350 per litre last week.\n\nIn the past few week, the country has been enmeshed in a toxic fuel debacle that has virtually crippled major cities such as Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt, and damaged thousands of vehicles. Experts believe that importation of this methanol laden fuel may not be unconnected with price to reduce the cost of subsidy or underecovery. Currently, the landing cost of fuel is about N380 per litre, while the pump price remains at N162, with a subsidy of N218 per litre.\n\nMr. Chika Mbonu, a former bank chief, said that oil has become a curse and blessing to the country and the war and the subsidy have exposed Nigeria\u2019s precarious position.\n\n\u201cThe two countries opposed to higher quota are Nigeria and Iran, expectedly so. Iran in under sanctions and can\u2019t raise production, while Nigeria\u2019s output has stagnated for years at 1.5 million barrels per day, and can\u2019t accommodate addition.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t escape the consequence of rising price, because high price of crude increases our subsidy, so it is in our interest to keep prices low to rein in our fuel import cost,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNigeria depends on oil for 60 percent revenue and 90 percent of foreign exchange for too long. This government came to power promising to diversify the economy but here we are with subsidy that is a quarter of the annual budget, which will continue rise with higher oil price.\n\n\u201cWith oil price at an eight year high Nigeria\u2019s fuel import cost as well as the subsidy rise. In fact, the 2022 budget is essentially dead, because subsidy is going to consume much of the revenue accruals from crude price\u201d.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

The new PDP has moved from the immediate past and returned to the people, hence this renewed hope and energy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI Congratulate Hon Agah and Da Dasat for an impressive and intimidating outing in the bye- elections. I commend all the hardworking members of our great party who, inspite all odds, have remained undaunted and strong\u201d.\n\n\u201d I want to especially appreciate the leadership of the state Chairman Hon Chris Hassan and his entire exco, who have provided good and sensitive leadership to the rank and file of the party. His leadership has proved clearly that where there is honesty, transparency, fear of God and sheer will determination, the sky\u2019s the limit for change. The political will of the current state leadership is inspiring, encouraging and stimulating. The openness and mutual respect is overwhelming, hence the beautiful benefits and rewards being harvested\u201d.\n\nGolu chided the APC- led state government for failing to learn good lessons of democracy from veterans across the world whose penchant for impunity and disrespect for the rule of law and due process has never lasted no matter how long it seems.\n\n\u201cIt always has expiry dates.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe hundreds of millions spent on just five wards in Pankshin South Constituency by the state government in which all government functionaries and key APC stakeholders woefully lost their units is pitiful and a signal that the end has come for those who have unrepentant penchant for manipulation.\n\n\u201cEven the ghost 20millions from the village boys could neither shake nor intimidate the voters. The masses are not moved by the newest billionaires in town who are accumulating and stockpiling monies for 2023. Our people are determined to change the change within the polity. I commend the dogged and resilient people of Pankshin South and Jos North/ Bassa constituencies for coming out enmass to reject those who have taken for granted the people of the state and have derailed democracy. This is a sign of what to expect in 2023 because there is no going back on the resolve to free and emancipate the Plateau.\n\nAccording to Golu, the quality of democracy has dwindled and gone down in the state in the last six years, adding that he is prepared to rekindle the people\u2019s hope if elected Governor come 2023.",

          "text": "Nigerian students caught in the Russia-Ukraine war cannot cross to Poland despite instructions by the federal government to do so.\n\nEven though the government said yesterday that the students should move to the Hungarian and the Romanian borders, many of them are facing perilous situations.\n\nHowever, following the reported difficulties faced by Nigerians trying to escape the war-torn country through the Polish border, the federal government has advised those affected to move to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County and Maramures borders.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued yesterday by the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gabriel Aduda.\n\nThere is sequel to reports that Nigerians trying to access the Polish border were being molested, extorted and denied entry into Poland among other threats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fully abreast of all the challenges Nigerians crossing into countries bordering Ukraine, especially the Polish border, are facing and we are taking adequate measures to assuage these challenges.\n\n\u201cThe minister of Foreign Affairs has spoken with his counterpart, the Foreign Minister of Ukraine, on these unsavoury developments and both are working on alleviating the suffering of Nigerians including deploying the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to the border to ensure easier access to all Nigerians and other nationals.\n\n\u201cFor now, movement to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu + Mare County and Maramures borders is advised, as they have approved visa free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine and arrangements for accommodation and feeding before evacuation is arranged.\n\n\u201cParents, guardians and wards of Nigerians in Ukraine are please enjoined to remain calm as the Federal Government of Nigeria is working very hard to get them all home safely.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Embassy in Bucharest, Romania, has informed Nigerians arriving from Ukraine that arrangements had been put in place to receive them at the Romanian entry points.\n\nThe embassy hotlines are: Consular officer +40747309174 and Head of Chancery, +40786091964\n\nThe arrangement is in addition to those made by the Romanian authorities to welcome evacuated /repatriated nationals of every country from Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNigerian nationals are advised to arrive at every entry point with valid documents and cooperate with the Romanian Immigration Officers at the border,\u201d the embassy said in a statement yesterday.\n\nNigerians Recount Ordeals\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLolade Lawal has had her life turned upside down in a way she never imagined.\n\nThe third-year medical student from Nigeria is coming to terms with the effects of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine that started last week.\n\n\u201cIt is scary, very scary. I\u2019m very worried. People are running for their lives. We are hiding in groups so we can keep an eye on each other,\u201d Lawal told Al Jazeera over the phone as she sheltered with other students at a safe bunker in the northeastern city of Sumy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no escape. Trains have stopped working. Most supermarkets are closed and those that are open are running very low on food stocks.\n\nATMs are not working and everyone is desperately looking for money,\u201d Lawal said, as sirens went off in the background.\n\nThere are no official figures on the number of African students currently studying in Ukraine but Lawal said \u201cthere are hundreds of us in our city\u201d.\n\n\u201cAt my university, there are about 100 Nigerian students. I\u2019m sheltering with some of them,\u201d Lawal added.\n\nSome students have managed to cross the border into Poland.\n\n\u201cI live in Kyiv. I have been living here since March last year,\u201d Somto Orah, a student at the State University of Telecommunications in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cWe have received no support from any government authorities. The school only gave us a bomb shelter to hide when the air raid siren is on. The sirens came on and off for about five times yesterday before I left,\u201d Orah, a Nigerian national, added.\n\n\u201cThere is little food. I couldn\u2019t access cash for two days now. Every ATM on the road has no cash.\u201d\n\nOthers have had even less luck. Samuel George, a first-year software engineering student, fled Kyiv after the shelling and sirens got too much for him to handle.\n\n\u201cI drove from Kyiv. We are trying to survive. We don\u2019t want to die in a foreign country,\u201d George said.\n\nAs he neared the Polish border, Samuel\u2019s luck ran out. He said he had a minor road accident with a vehicle carrying Ukrainians because the road was narrow.\n\nHe said they took his money and stopped him from driving any further.\n\n\u201cThey are not officials, police or military. They are normal citizens who stopped us Africans from driving to the border. They let Ukrainians pass through but not us,\u201d George said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now walking to the border. I have no other option. I don\u2019t know how much further the border is. They even took our money. It is like\n\nthey are not human beings,\u201d George said, adding that he could no longer talk on the phone because his hands were freezing in the sub-zero temperature.\n\nOn Saturday, the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs said more than 115,000 people had crossed into Poland from Ukraine, adding thateveryone from Ukraine was allowed to enter, even those without a valid passport.\n\nBut for Somto and several other students, crossing the border into Poland has not been easy. \u201cI will be heading to Nigeria from Poland if I\u2019m able to cross. But if I see a school offer around Schengen, I will take it up because I don\u2019t want my school life to be disrupted,\u201d he said as he joined the queue at the border gate.\n\nRussian Military Puts Nuclear Weapons On High Alert\n\n\u2026Kyiv to hold talks with Moscow\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he is moving Russia\u2019s nuclear deterrent to \u201cspecial alert\u201d as a response to NATO \u201caggression\u201d\n\nPutin ordered his military command to put deterrence forces \u2013 a reference to units which include nuclear arms \u2013 on high alert, citing statements by NATO leaders and economic sanctions against Moscow.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, not only do Western countries take unfriendly measures against our country in the economic dimension \u2013 I mean the illegal sanctions that everyone knows about very well \u2013 but also the top officials of leading NATO countries allow themselves to make aggressive statements with regards to our country,\u201d Putin said on state television.\n\nThe move does not mean Russia intends to use the weapons even as the US has condemned the move as \u201cunacceptable\u201d\n\nBBC Frank Gardner said Russia\u2019s announcement that its nuclear deterrent has been put on \u201cspecial alert\u201d is a sign of both President Putin\u2019s anger at the West\u2019s anti-Russian sanctions and his enduring paranoia that his country is under threat from NATO.\n\nMeanwhile Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv will send a delegation for talks \u201cwithout preconditions\u201d with Moscow at the Ukraine-Belarus border.\n\nThis comes after a phone call between Zelenskyy and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. \u201cWe agreed that the Ukrainian delegation would meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a statement after holding a phone call with Lukashenko.\n\nHe did not give a precise time for the meeting, but said Lukashenko, a Putin ally, \u201chas taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on Belarusian territory remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation\u2019s travel, talks and return.\n\nAs the war rages across Ukrainian cities Regional Governor Oleh Sinegubov said Ukrainian troops have full control of the country\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, after street fighting with Russian forces.\n\nKyiv\u2019s mayor said there are no Russian soldiers in the capital, and that the city\u2019s defences are holding firm.\n\nMore than 360,000 Ukrainians have fled the country since the beginning of Moscow\u2019s assault, the UN said\n\nPMB Expresses Worry Over Treatment Of Nigerians, Africans Fleeing Ukraine Through Poland\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday expressed worry over a ill-treatment meted in Nigerians nationals and citizens of other African countries trying to flee troubled Ukraine through Poland.\n\nA statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President media and publicity, Garba Shehu called for equal treatment for everyone scampering for safety in the war zone.\n\nThe president noted that all those who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN Convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\n\n\u201cBut, for that reason, it is paramount that everyone is treated with dignity and without favour,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cWhile efforts to begin talks between Russia and Ukraine are underway, paramount on our minds is the safety and human rights of some four thousand Nigerian citizens and many others from friendly African nations today stranded in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThere is a long history dating back to decades of Nigerians and other Africans studying in Ukraine, particularly medicine. The majority of Nigerian citizens in the country today are university-enrolled students.\n\n\u201cFrom video evidence, first-hand reports, and from those in contact with their wards and/or Nigerian consular officials there have been unfortunate reports of Ukrainian police and security personnel refusing to allow Nigerians to board buses and trains heading towards the Ukraine-Poland border.\n\n\u201cIn one video widely circulating on social media, a Nigerian mother with her young baby was filmed being physically forced to give up her seat to another person.\n\n\u201cThere are also separate reports of Polish officials simply refusing Nigerian citizens\u2019 entry into Poland from Ukraine,\u201d the president said.\n\nAccording to the statement, one group of Nigerian students having been repeatedly refused entry into Poland have concluded they have no choice but to travel again across Ukraine and attempt to exit the country via the border with Hungary.\n\n\u201cWe understand the pain and fear that is confronting all people who find themselves in this terrifying place.\n\nWe also appreciate that those in official positions in security and border management will in most cases be experiencing impossible expectations in a situation they never expected.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are proud of those educated in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities and centres of learning who have returned to Nigeria to perform great service for our nation and our people.\n\n\u201cWithout the generosity of spirit of the Ukrainian people that would never have been possible,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari, however, prayed for those directly affected by this conflict as he said Nigeria, with it\u2019s 200 million people, support all and every diplomatic effort to bring this war to an end.\n\nUkraine Will \u2018Prevail\u2019 Amid Russia\u2019s Assault, Says foreign Minister\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia\u2019s goal is to \u201cdestroy Ukraine as a state, but we will not fall,\u201d Kuleba said in a televised address.\n\n\u201cThis is a war between President Putin and the people of Ukraine. We are determined to fight back fiercely as long as it is needed, to defend our land and our people \u2026 and I am sure that we will prevail. We will not give up a single inch of our territory,\u201d he added.\n\nFrance Closes Airspace To Russian Aircraft\n\nFrance has announced that it will follow other European countries in shutting its airspace to Russian aircraft to punish the country for invading Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrance is shutting its airspace to all Russian aircraft and airlines from this evening on,\u201d Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari tweeted.\n\nKyiv\u2019s defence Holding Firm, Says Mayor\n\nKyiv\u2019s mayor says there are no Russian troops in the Ukrainian capital, adding the city\u2019s defence is holding firm against attacks from Moscow\u2019s forces.\n\n\u201cOur military, law enforcement and territorial defence continue to detect and neutralise saboteurs,\u201d Vitali Klitschko wrote on his Telegram messaging channel.\n\nUkraine Has Full Control Of Kharkiv, Regional Official Claims\n\nUkraine has full control of Kharkiv, Sinegubov said.\n\n\u201cControl over Kharkiv is completely ours! The armed forces, the police, and the defense forces are working, and the city is being completely cleansed of the enemy,\u201d he wrote on the Telegram messaging service.\n\nAl Jazeera was unable to independently verify the regional governor\u2019s claim.\n\nOver 360,000 Ukrainians Flee Country\n\nAt least 368,000 people have now fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighbouring countries in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) says.\n\nThe number has risen rapidly since Moscow launched its onslaught and is expected to continue to climb quickly.\n\nMore European States Bar Russian Planes\n\nA string of European countries, including Germany and Finland, have said they are preparing to close their airspace to Russian planes, mirroring measures already taken by other states on the continent.\n\nSweden, Denmark and Iceland were alongside Berlin and Helsinki as the latest to take action.\n\nGermany said its ban will last for three months and apply to all Russian flights from 14:00 GMT yesterday as the screws tighten on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Only humanitarian flights will be exempt from Berlin\u2019s measure.\n\nThe United Kingdom, Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Romania, as well as Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, have also moved to shutter their airspace to Russian planes.\n\nGreece To send Defence Supplies To Ukraine\n\nGreece is sending defence supplies to Ukraine in response to a request from Kyiv, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019s office said.\n\nTwo C-130 military transport planes will carry the supplies to Poland, from where they will be transported onwards to Ukraine, the office said.\n\nThe move comes after Athens said on Saturday that 10 Greek nationals had been killed and six others wounded by Russian bombings near the city of Mariupol, in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nEU Should Fund Weapons, Fuel For \u2018Heroic\u2019 Ukraine, Says Borrell\n\nThe European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief has said he will propose using the bloc\u2019s funds to help finance weapons and other supplies for Ukraine during a meeting of its foreign ministers later.\n\n\u201cI will propose to [EU foreign] ministers to use the European Peace Facility for two emergency assistance measures,\u201d Josep Borrell said in a statement before the virtual meeting.\n\n\u201cThese aim to finance the supply of lethal material to the heroic Ukrainian army, which is fighting with fierce resistance against the Russian invaders and provide urgently needed non-lethal supplies, such as fuel.\u201d",

          "text": "As presidential hopefuls continue to woo top Nigerian leaders for the top seat ahead of the 2023 general election, prominent socio-cultural regional bodies have urged the \u2018kingmakers\u2019 in the country to ensure they are guided by justice and equity.\n\nSpecifically, they were referring to former President Olusegun Obasanjo; former military president, Gen Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, and former head of state, Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar.\n\nIn the past few months, the homes of these three former Nigerian leaders had become a Mecca of sorts by presidential aspirants since the race for the 2023 presidency began in earnest.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with LEADERSHIP on what Nigerians should expect from these prominent leaders, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said the elder statesmen should prioritise justice and fairness ahead of 2023.\n\nNational publicity secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, said, \u201cOutside endorsement, Obasanjo and others should talk to other leaders to ensure that the person who will emerge in 2023 will actualise justice and fair play.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn its part, the apex northern socio-cultural group, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), said beyond endorsing candidates, the leaders should remain as statesmen.\n\nSpokesperson of the forum, Emmanuel Yawe said, \u201cThe ACF cannot speak for these people. They have their spokesmen and also always speak for themselves. What the ACF expects of them is that they will continue to be statesmen and nothing more ahead of the 2023 election\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Movement for the Survival of Izon Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND) said the former leaders should be talking about how to unite Nigerians rather than endorsing candidates for the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, president-general of MOSIEND, Kennedy Tonjo West, wondered why the former leaders were shying away from guiding Nigerians into the path of unity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWest stated: \u201cRight now, it appears to us that these elder statesmen, the Abdulsalami Abubakars, the Babangidas, the Obasanjos and the Gowons are not talking about how to unite this country.\n\n\u201cAnd the only way to unite this country is when you give justice to the so-much oppressed regions. All of them are on their departure lounge. Yet, they are saying away from telling Nigerians what to do.\u201d\n\nThe MOSIEND leader called for the jettisoning of the 1999 constitution and the drafting of a new constitution, insisting that the existing laws were imposed on Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur take on the endorsement being given by national leaders to one politician or the other is not what is going to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThere should be no election in 2023 until the 1999 constitution, which was imposed on Nigerians is jettisoned and a fresh constitution be drafted that will address constitutional abnormalities, constitutional frictions that are tearing this country apart.\n\n\u201cWe have issues of restructuring everywhere, we have issues of Biafra wanting a secession, and we have issues of Oduduwa wanting a country of their own.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor its part, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) urged the leaders, especially those of the northern extraction, to ensure power shifts to the South.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that even though it is not explicitly stated in the constitution, Nigeria has been sharing power between the North and the South, Christians and Muslims.\n\nThe incumbent president, Muhammadu Buhari, who is of the Muslim North extraction will complete a two term of eight years by 2023.\n\nBut interest from politicians from all parts of the country, especially those from the North to take over from Buhari has been raising concern.\n\nWhile the Southern governors under the leadership of Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akerodolu, has declared that the South must produce Buhari\u2019s successor, some northerners, especially politicians have viewed the comment as insulting, insisting that since they have the population and the voting strength, power should remain in the North.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP, president of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu, warned that if the Nigerian leaders fail to intervene and power does not shift to the South, it will affect the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe leader and a statesman is supposed to lead people in the way of Justice and fair play,\u201d Pogu said, adding that if Abdulsalami, IBB and Gowon do not prevail on politicians of the Northern extraction to bury their presidential ambition in favour of the South in the 2023 general election, it will affect the unity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey must look at the issues, analise them and see what will bring peace and progress,\u201d Pogu told the former Nigerian leaders.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have looked passionately at the Nigerian situation. The insecurity In the North, the economy has gone bad, we hope people that are entrepreneurs will come in and resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cIf a northerner is here and the North is being ravaged by insecurity, we need somebody from the South that will ensure justice. We need somebody who is not going to be nepotism or tribalistic. We need somebody who will look at the problem as a leader. We know that as a country, some sections have not had a shot in the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe must look at that region that has not had a shot, and select someone credible from there. We want the issue of rotation of power to continue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said it here that by 2023 the presidency should go to the South. In the South, the people know that the South East are the most marginalized. Our own goal is to suggest, shout, and make contribution. But at the end of the day, anyone selected from the South should be the next president\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, as Abdulsalami, IBB and Gowon keep receiving presidential candidates across the country, they should be told the truth that power should shift to the South.\n\n\u201cIn their endorsement, Gowon, IBB and Abdulsalami should ensure that they tell the candidates that power should go to the South. They are elder statesmen and we believe they want good for the country. We believe they are going to ensure that Nigeria remains indivisible and peaceful\u201d.\n\nHe further noted that if power goes to the South, many Nigerians will believe in the oneness of the country. It\u2019s not about population alone. It is about carrying everyone and every part of the country along. It is time we continue to pursue unity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former deputy governor of Kaduna State, James Bawa Magaji, has said that power rotation is not constitutional, insisting that anyone interested in the seat should be allowed to contest for the office of president come 2023.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP, Magaji recalled that Moshood Abiola won the 1993 presidential election not as a result of zoning.\n\nMagaji said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in zoning because it is not democratic. It is a shenanigan that robs Peter to pay Paul. After all, Abiola won election in 1993, not based on zoning but his wide spread acceptability across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo also president Muhammadu Buhari who won election because of his wide spread acceptability and followership across the country. The presidency of Nigeria is not child\u2019s play. Therefore, anybody who wants to be president must undertake a self-internal capability test. And if he has what it takes, he should run for president irrespective of where the person comes from. This will likely bring positive result to the person rather than zoning which has no general voter guarantee,\u201d Magaji said.\n\nMagaji who notes that in a democracy every person, people and group have the rights to vote and be voted for charged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure the conduct of a credible election in 2023.\n\nWhile calling on Nigerians, irrespective of region, to participate fully in the next election, he said they should vote for people of integrity.\n\n\u201cNigerians must vote for people with capacity to do the job. We must never again go down the road of voting based on non-entitic and idiotic primordial bases. Ethnicity, religion, sectional and all of these sentiments have never led us anywhere other than sorrow, tears and deaths,\u201d Magaji added.",

It\u2019s not that they had anything against the man that was being buried. In fact, one of the in-laws from Vandeikya who provided the coffin for the burial of the deceased man was sadly gunned down by the invading gunmen.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe family unfortunately refused to go with security personnel for the burial as was the usual practice for fear of the unknown gunmen. What they feared most eventually happened to them,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nAtera also said a kindred head, Zaki Isaac Vaatyouhh Gande was among those who were killed while the three others sustained injuries from gunshots and later taken to a nearby clinic for first aide treatment before they were transferred to bigger hospital for proper medical attention.\n\nArmy denies reprisal\n\nBut when contacted, Force Commander of OPWS, Major-General Kevin Aligbe, who confirmed the attack, however dispelled insinuation that it was a retaliation of an earlier killing of some wanted armed militias by his troops.\n\n\n\nAligbe, who noted that there was an ongoing raid of bandits\u2019 hideouts in the entire Sankera area, however vowed that all perpetrators of the dastardly acts as well as other criminal elements within the area would be smoked out.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is true that we are on operation around that area. The reason is that these guys (bandits) have been killing people and extorting people. So, whatever happened yesterday (Saturday) is not as a result of what we are doing because some of them (bandits) have submitted weapons within the last two weeks or something like that.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have just made up their minds that they are going to make the place unsafe to law abiding citizens. But in the next two weeks we are going to get all of them. That is sure promise to Benue people,\u201d Aligbe promised.\n\nNiger bandits\n\nIn a related development, bandits at the weekend ransacked 12 villages in Lavun local government area of Niger state killing eight people while over 5000 villagers were reportedly displaced.\n\nThe attack on the communities, it was learnt, was still on Sunday afternoon as the bandits spread to more communities.\n\nChairman Lavun local government council, Hon Ibrahim Limanko Pata confirmed the incident in a condolence message to his people.\n\n\n\nHe commiserated with victims of the attacks which occurred in Ebbo and Ndagbegi communities under Egbako Ward.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the bandits had spread to more villages as villagers fled the area.\n\nAn eyewitness account said: \u201cThe attack lasted all through to Sunday morning, during which the gunmen overran about 12 communities, leaving over 5,000 displaced.\u201d\n\nThe witness who pleaded anonymity listed the communities overran by the bandits to include Egbako, Ndaruka, Ebbo, Ndagbegi, Tshogi, Gogata and Ndakogitu, all in Lavun local government area.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time gunmen could launch a major offensive on the area, regarded as a-no-go area due to the people\u2019s strong hold on the power of their tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, the bandits are spreading to more villages of Satifu, Yekoko, Sokiara and moving into Batita village,\u201d he said.\n\nThe gunmen also reportedly disrupted a wedding ceremony at Gbacitagi village, kidnapped the bride and one other girl.\n\nThe hoodlums, according to reports, also carted away all the monies realised at the wedding ceremony, including other valuables\n\n\u201cThey also rustled a number of cattle belonging to the villagers. However, while on their way out of the communities and heading towards Akare community in Wushishi local government area of the state, with their rustled cattle, the gunmen got stuck at Akere when they discovered that the only bridge linking the community with Akare had collapsed,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source close to Akere community, said the gunmen were currently stranded at the point of crossing with the cattle as the animals refused to enter the river.\n\nIt was learnt that the bandits eventually abandoned the cattle at the Akere river bank when all efforts to cross the animals were not successful, and that they decided to retreat back to Sheshi community to find a possible exit out of the community.\n\nBlueprint learnt that this was where the bandits were engaged in gun battle by local vigilantes during which two vigilantes and four locals also died.\n\nThe gunmen, according to the locals, later shared themselves into three groups with one group at Dabban community, another group at Shegba, while the third group was said to be heading towards Ndaruka community.\n\nHowever, Blueprint gathered that the bandits entered Bida, the traditional headquarters of the Nupe Kingdom at about 2pm Sunday.\n\nLocals are said to be fighting the bandits with a means to repel the attackers.\n\nA source said the bandits were confirmed to be at the Ilorin motor park in Bida where they entered in confusion.\n\nIt was learnt that the Sagi in Bida is leading the battle of Bida against the bandits.\n\nWe\u2019 rounded them up \u2013 NGSG\n\nBut the government of Niger state has said security operatives have rounded up the terrorists who invaded several communities in Bida emirate and that eight of the bandits were neutralised while others are holed up along the flanks of River Kaduna.\n\nCommissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal security Emmanuel Umar stated this in a press briefing after an emergency security meeting at the Government House Minna.\n\nHe explained that the bandits entered the area about two days ago and were apparently aware of heavy security presence along the Wushishi cattle routes which made them to turn to Lavun and Kutigi local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cHowever, security and local vigilantes engaged the bandits in gun battle during which 8 bandits were killed. They moved over to Laun and Kutigi local governments and to the flanks of river Kaduna up to Dabban community. They are currently rounded up in the area and we hope to neutralise them,\u201d Umar said.\n\nThe commissioner said security agencies had fully mobilised to the area and supported by air strikes.\n\nHe, however, described the report that bandits have entered Bida as untrue, adding that \u201cI also got that report that the bandits were in specific area in Bida but I called the Area Commander who said the report is false.\u201d\n\nHe advised people to disregard such fake report, adding that \u201cgovernment is committed to flush out the terrorists from the state. I am happy to tell you that the security agencies and the local communities are more committed to wiped out the terrorists as we employ new strategy\u201d.\n\nISWAP kills 11 farmers in Borno\n\nIn a related development, about 11 farmers have been killed by suspected members of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) during an attack in the southern part of the Borno State on Saturday.\n\nIt was learnt that ISWAP had stormed a remote village, Sabon-Gari in Damboa Local Government Area of the state on Saturday. The village is located about 125 kilometres from Maiduguri, the state capital.\n\nAccording to a security source, about seven bodies were recovered Saturday before an additional four were found Sunday afternoon.\n\nAnother source disclosed that a woman was among the casualties.\n\n\u201cWe(combined security forces) recovered a total of 11 dead bodies of farmers, they were all shot several times, they will be buried later in the day according to Islamic rite.\u201d the source said.\n\nZamfara\n\nAnd in what looks like a reprieve, the rescue operations to free abducted victims in Zamfara state has yielded some dividends as the state police command, in a joint operation, rescued seven kidnapped victims.\n\nThe command\u2019s public relations officer, SP Muhammad Shehu said this at press briefing in Gusau Sunday.\n\n\u201cOn 25th February , 2022, the Tactical operatives of the command in Collaboration with the military deployed along Dansadau axis in Maru LGA of Zamfara State have Successfully rescued seven (7) Kidnapped victims who are natives of Chibade village in Rijau LGA of Niger State,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said during debriefing, the victims informed the Police that, on 21st February, 2022 bandits in large number, stormed their village (Chibade) and abducted seven of them to unknown location in Dansadau forest of Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cJoint Police and Military operatives while on a coordinated bush clearance around Dansadau axis, successfully rescued the affected victims and brought them to Yariman Bakura Specialist Hospital, Gusau where they received medical check,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe police image-maker stated that all the victims would be handed over to the Commissioner of Police Niger State Police Command for further appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Zamfara State Command, CP Ayuba N.

          "title": "APC National Convention: Plot to postpone March 26 date thickens \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "Following a shift in date for the 2023 general elections as announced by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), there are fresh plots by some interests in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to embark on campaign for the postponement of its national convention slated for March 26, 2022.\n\nAccording to INEC, the notice of election across its offices in the country would be published February 28 while political parties have from April 4 to June 3, 2022 to conduct their primaries and ensure resolution of disputes from the exercise.\n\nThe APC had postponed its national convention three times before settling down for the 26th of March, 2022.\n\nAfter two postponements in 2021, the Governor Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) which earlier settled for February 26 for the much-talked about party exercise later agreed to March 26.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the development has, however, divided the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) on whether the March 26 date be adjusted or left as it is, even as the governors forum has a plan to hold another meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari this week over the new INEC\u2019s timetable.\n\nAt the planned meeting with the president this week, a reliable source said a decision would be taken on whether another date be fixed for the party\u2019s national convention or stick to March 26.\n\nThe source said: \u201cI am aware that APC governors will meet with the president between Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss this new timeline for party primary election and to take decision on the national convention.\u201d\n\nAlso, the proponents of the fresh plot are giving the new INEC\u2019s timetable which mandates all political parties to hold presidential primary election between April 2022 and June 3, 2022, as reason to elongate the life-span of the Buni-led CECPC till the end of May, when national convention and presidential primary election should hold at once.\n\nTwo APC chieftains who spoke with Blueprint on the condition of anonymity said it would amount to waste of time and resources to hold national convention by March 26 and primary election six or seven weeks after, hence the call for postponement.\n\nOne of them said: \u201cThere is no more hiding behind a finger because INEC has given a timeline when our presidential candidate should emerge, so why the rush for the national convention? I think it will be wise to hold these exercises at once to avoid waste of resources, time and risk of gathering our members from across the states in Abuja within two months.\n\n\u201cOur message is that both our presidential candidate and the new National Working Committee (NWC) can emerge at once.\u201d\n\nThe source said his group of APC members, in the coming days, would make an official statement to the presidency and CECPC leadership.\n\nAnother source, a senior member of the ruling party who corroborated the above position, called on the Buni-led caretaker leadership of APC to fully concentrate on emergence of zonal leaders while a new date is worked out to align with primary election between April and June.\n\nThe source said: \u201cIt is now clear that providence has planned it that Buni\u2019s CECPC will eventually complete the tenure of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole-led NWC, we should however work against this plan.\u201d\n\nContinuing, she said: \u201cWe will soon come out to sell this idea for our leaders on the need to have a rethink on the new date (March 26) for the national convention. We don\u2019t have any hidden agenda rather than ensuring that our party remains stronger after this exercise and we believe that between now and May, the Caretaker Committee can still resolve more crises, ensure emergence of quality leaders at our zonal levels and handover a stronger structure to the incoming NWC members.\u201d\n\nINEC warns on early campaigns\n\nMeanwhile, the INEC has warned political parties and aspirants to strictly adhere to the timeframe for commencement of campaigns for the 2023 general elections which commences 150 days to the polling day and ends 24hours before the Election Day.\n\nChairman of the commission, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at press briefing while fielding questions from newsmen Saturday to unveil the timetable and schedule of activities for 2023 general elections.\n\nYakubu said there is also the time for the end of the campaigns which he said was 24 hours to the elections.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to draw the attention of parties and candidates that the law makes a specific definite provisions for the commencement of campaigns and end of campaigns and all Nigerians are required to adhere with the provisions of the law including political parties and candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that any political party that operates outside the timelines set by the commission, especially with regards to the nomination of primaries, would not be expected to nominate a candidate to the commission.\n\nYakubu noted that the timelines were supported by regulations and guidelines which are in the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cSo we expect all political parties to comply. Any political party that fails to comply with the timelines provided for in the time table and schedule of activities particularly with respect to the conduct of party primaries for the nomination candidates will not expected to nominate a candidate to the commission,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the timetable and schedule of activities for next year\u2019s general election, the presidential and the National Assembly elections would hold February 25, 2022 while the governorship and State Houses of Assembly elections follow two weeks later on March 11, 2022.\n\nINEC schedule of activities and timetable prescribes that the campaigns for presidential and National Assembly elections would commence 28th September 2022 while that of the governorship and State Houses of Assembly would commence October 12, 2022.\n\nAccording to INEC, conduct of party primaries, including resolution of disputes, arising from the primaries would commence April 4, and end June 3, 2022.",

          "text": "Hong Kong may impose a China-style hard lockdown that confines people to their homes, authorities signalled Monday, with the city\u2019s zero-Covid strategy in tatters and bodies piling up in hospitals.\n\nTwo years of strict zero-Covid policies kept the coronavirus largely bay but a breakthrough of the highly transmissible Omicron variant exposed how little authorities had done to prepare for a mass outbreak.\n\nHong Kong leader Carrie Lam previously ruled out a citywide lockdown and instead has ordered all 7.4 million residents to be tested in March.\n\nBut in a U-turn, health secretary Sophia Chan confirmed on Monday that it was still an option.\n\nAsked by a presenter at Commercial Radio whether a lockdown was still ruled out she replied: \u201cNo. We are still discussing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a public health perspective, to bring out the best effect of compulsory universal testing, we need to reduce people\u2019s movements to some extent,\u201d she added.\n\nChan\u2019s comments came a day after Li Dachuan, a senior mainland official involved in a joint taskforce with Hong Kong authorities, described a lockdown as \u201cthe most ideal and best approach to achieve the best effect of universal tests\u201d.\n\nBodies In Hospital\n\nThe revelation adds fresh uncertainty and anxiety for residents and businesses in a city gripped by the kind of chaos that was more familiar at the start of the pandemic.\n\nHong Kong has now recorded 193,000 cases and 636 deaths in the current wave since December 31.\n\nThat compares to just 12,000 infections and 205 deaths for the whole of the rest of the pandemic. Hospitals have been stretched to breaking point for weeks and on Sunday officials revealed bodies are piling up at hospitals because mortuaries are full.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, we face a problem of transportation of dead bodies from hospital to public mortuary,\u201d Hospital Authority chief manager Lau Ka-hin told reporters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why there are some bodies who were initially planned to be transported to public mortuary, but stayed in hospital.\u201d\n\nHigh Mortality Rate\n\nHong Kong\u2019s seven-day average death rate is currently running at around eight per one million people.\n\nThat compares with five per million for the United States, 1.80 for Britain and 1.36 for Singapore which, like Hong Kong, initially opted for zero-Covid but shifted more recently to a mitigation strategy and reopening to the wider world.\n\nOfficials have revealed that 91 percent of those who have died in the current wave were not fully vaccinated.\n\nThe vast majority of the dead \u2014 92 percent \u2014 are people aged 60 or above with the median age 84 years old as the virus rips through care homes in the densely populated city.\n\nDespite ample supplies Hong Kong had a dismal vaccination rate among over-70s before Omicron struck.\n\nChina is now increasingly calling the shots on Hong Kong\u2019s response with the joint taskforce operating out of the neighbouring city of Shenzhen.\n\nMainland crews are working on constructing a series of temporary hospitals and isolation wards for the infected, although the current caseload far outstrips supply.\n\nAmong those advising the government is Liang Wannian, a senior mainland official that the South China Morning Post reported was arriving in Hong Kong on Monday.\n\nLiang was a key architect of the successful two-month long lockdown in Wuhan where the coronavirus first emerged, a strategy China has continued to deploy in other cities as soon as cases are detected.\n\nWuhan\u2019s official toll was 53,000 cases and it took two months to suppress with a full lockdown.\n\nHong Kong has recorded that many cases in just two days and is also battling a much more infectious variant.",

For the last 200 years, our country has operated under the Monroe Doctrine, embracing the premise that as the dominant power in the western hemisphere,\u201d explained Sanders, \u201cthe United States has the right to intervene against any country that might threaten our alleged interests.\u201d\n\nUnder this doctrine, noted the US senator, America had committed various atrocities on foreign lands.\n\nThe Democratic senator stressed, \u201cWe have undermined and overthrown at least a dozen governments. In 1962 we came to the brink of nuclear war with the Soviet Union in response to the placement of Soviet missiles in Cuba, 90 miles from our shore, which the Kennedy administration saw as an unacceptable threat to our national security.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd the Monroe Doctrine is not ancient history. As recently as 2018, Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, called the Monroe Doctrine \u2018as relevant today as it was the day it was written\u2019. In 2019, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, John Bolton, declared \u2018the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well\u2019.\u201d\n\nFurther condemning the US grandstanding and hypocritical response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Sanders explained, \u201cTo put it simply, even if Russia was not ruled by a corrupt authoritarian leader like Vladimir Putin, Russia, like the United States, would still have an interest in the security policies of its neighbours.\u201d\n\nThe Almanac of American Politics calls Sanders, serving his third term in the US Senate after winning re-election in 2018, a \u201cpractical and successful legislator.\u201d\n\nThe one-time American presidential aspirant did not mince words expressing his displeasure against the US government\u2019s subversiveness against Russia.\n\n\u201cDoes anyone really believe that the United States would not have something to say if, for example, Mexico was to form a military alliance with a US adversary?\u201d said Sanders. \u201cCountries should be free to make their own foreign policy choices, but making those choices wisely requires a serious consideration of the costs and benefits.\u201d He further pointed out that \u201cthe fact is that the US and Ukraine entering into a deeper security relationship is likely to have some very serious costs \u2013 for both countries.\u201d\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Despite the rising international prices of oil, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited failed to remit its statutory funding to the Federation Account which is jointly operated by the federal, state and local governments, in January 2022.\n\nThat was the second time in less than a year that the national oil company (NOC) would be unable to deliver a kobo to the joint account, following the same occurrence in April last year, when the firm announced zero remittance for the month.\n\nIn addition, a document detailing NNPC\u2019s activities for the month under review, presented during the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) held last Thursday, indicated that the NOC expended a whopping N210.38 billion on petrol subsidy during the month.\n\nTHISDAY recalls that with a deficit of approximately N2 trillion out of its projected N2.511 trillion, the NNPC was unable to remit roughly 80 per cent of its projected contribution to the Federation Account in 2021.\n\nFor the entire 12 months of last year, the NNPC disbursed N542 billion as against the budgeted N2.511 trillion, despite a monthly contribution estimate of N209.3 billion. The N542 billion represented just about 21. 6 per cent of the total expected contribution of the NNPC to the joint account.\n\nThe development underscored how a combination of factors, including declining oil production, rising subsidy payments and high oil production costs, have hobbled the organisation\u2019s performance despite the increasing oil prices which overshot $105 per barrel last week.\n\nEarlier in the year, President Muhammadu Buhari had backtracked on the planned full deregulation of the downstream sector, including the wholesale removal of petrol subsidy, citing the negative impact it would have on the poor in the country.\n\nFor decades, Nigeria\u2019s attempt to fully free the downstream oil and gas industry has met with a brick wall. The latest effort has also been pushed forward by about 18 months, effectively exempting the current administration which will exit by May 2023 of any burden.\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis in January 2022, had shown that total deductions for petrol subsidy or what the government terms under-recovery was about N1.43 trillion for 2021.\n\nThe journey to zero remittance in January was envisaged by close watchers of the industry as the NNPC only delivered a paltry N14.8 billion, N10.54 billion and N20 billion in October, November and December respectively last year.\n\nIn December, the three tiers of government shared N675.946 billion as FAAC revenue for the month of November while in January, it shared N699.82 billion for December.\n\nBut the total funds shared in February markedly decreased to N574.66 billion, raising concerns over the capacity of sub-nationals to meet their current financial obligations.\n\nThe amount shared by the federal, state and local governments dropped to a four-year low this month, a huge blow to states that are already struggling to survive.\n\nBut in the latest monthly presentation to FAAC held on February 24, obtained by TheCable, NNPC pointed out that the N210 billion shortfall included a December 2021 value of N176.48 billion plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N33.90 billion accruing from 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the oil firm stated that it would deduct N242.5 billion, which was the about N143.7 billion for January 2022 recovery and November spot arrears of N98.8 billion, during next month\u2019s FAAC meeting. It, however stated that the national oil company recorded N383 billion as gross revenue from crude oil sales in January, a dip from the projected N414.9 billion.\n\nThe fall would significantly negatively affect states that are presently experiencing fiscal stress and had been kicking against deductions of the shortfall from FAAC remittances.\n\nWhile an ad-hoc committee of the National Economic Council (NEC) had recommended gradual deregulation of petrol prices by February 2022 to reduce the pressure on revenue accruing to states, recently Buhari asked the National Assembly to approve the N2.557 trillion budget for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies OPEC+ have revised down forecast for the 2022 oil market surplus by about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, according to a base scenario in a technical committee report seen by Reuters on Sunday.\n\nThe data which is part of a report the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) prepares for OPEC+ ministers \u2013 also showed stocks in the developed world standing at 62 million barrels below the 2015 to 2019 average by the end of the year.\n\nIn a previous forecast it had predicted the stocks would reach 20 million barrels above the same average by that point.\n\nMinisters from OPEC and allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, will meet on March 2 to decide whether to increase output by 400,000 bpd in April.\n\nSources from the group told Reuters their output deal is showing no cracks so far after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and the group is likely to stick to a planned output rise despite crude topping $100 a barrel.\n\nData from a separate JTC report also showed the group produced in January 972,000 bpd less than the targets outlined by the deal, compared with 824,000 less in December.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
          "summary": "That was the second time in less than a year that the national oil company (NOC) would be unable to deliver a kobo to the joint account, following the same occurrence in April last year, when the firm announced zero remittance for the month.\nTHISDAY recalls that with a deficit of approximately N2 trillion out of its projected N2.511 trillion, the NNPC was unable to remit roughly 80 per cent of its projected contribution to the Federation Account in 2021.\n6 per cent of the total expected contribution of the NNPC to the joint account.\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis in January 2022, had shown that total deductions for petrol subsidy or what the government terms under-recovery was about N1.43 trillion for 2021.\nIt, however stated that the national oil company recorded N383 billion as gross revenue from crude oil sales in January, a dip from the projected N414.9 billion.",
