If medically a child, because of age, is exposed to sexually transmitted infections, death at childbirth, such marriage is unjust.\n\n\u201cAs a person, you must be seen to be promoting mercy and any form of violence against women and girls, God frowns at it.\n\n\u201cThe women around us should be cherished and protected in all that we do as a people for without them humanity is threatened,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that Islam is a religion of peace and must be seen to be promoting that in all ramifications.\n\nOnike charged the campaigners to work hard to ensure that the menace of violence against women and the girl child was eliminated in the society.\n\nThe Lead Project Officer for NASFAT-UNICEF-EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, Alhaja Ganiyat Babalola, who declared open the campaign, said that violence against women and the girl child was the responsibility of all to stop.\n\nBabalola described the high rate of domestic violence against women in the society as alarming.\n\nShe said that keeping quiet when such violence as rape, battering, discrimination against a widow and others were committed was not ideal.\n\n\u201cBy speaking out, help will definitely come and through such the menace will fizzle out.\n\n\u201cAs an organisation, we are working in partnership with the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs, the Nigeria Police and others to ensure that culprits contended with the law of the land.\n\n\u201cAlthough, there are challenges in prosecuting offenders as some victims are under family and societal pressure not to come up with information that will nail persons charged,\u201d she said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Since the pronouncement of the ban by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, did you hear any prominent figure from the North speaking against the Twitter ban?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid we read anything from the prolific writer and Professor who was the head a group called MURIC saying anything? No. The reason was because Buhari was only carrying out part of their demonic agenda.\u201d\n\nThe one time Osun State Chairman of the Nigerian Union of Journalists maintained that the gospel of Jesus is about communication and not about carrying swords or engaging in war and Twitter is one of the effective means of doing so.\n\nPoliticians giving guns to bandits \u2013 Seun Kuti\n\n\u201cJust as millions of members of RCCG, Deeper Life, Winners Chapel and a host of other ministries were denied access to their members, I was also unable to communicate with several of other Bishops across the world as we planned towards the Centenary Celebration of WAC this year\u201d, he lamented.\n\nThe Osun based cleric cautioned Buhari and his cabinet to stop fighting against God by his actions.\n\n\u201cI hope the president will listen and remember that it takes nothing from God to remove him from office if He so wishes. Therefore, President Buhari should within seven days reverse his decision and unban Twitter. If not, some of us will go on our knees and ask God to do the needful. Buhari should not put the gospel of Christ in chain\u201d, he threatened.\n\nBishop Adeoye praised Pastor Enoch Adeboye and Pastor Williams Kumuyi who relied on the United Nations article which Nigeria is a signatory to by totally rejecting the Islamic agenda of President Buhari over the Twitter ban.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore waiting patiently for the next move of the Buhari-led government to see what he intends to do to these fathers of faith\u201d, he added.",

Your record can be traced to another country that is not yours, with all the risks it entails.\n\n\u201cMany individuals and organisations using VPN have lost their investments after compromising the security of their devices.

          "title": "Fed Govt to JUSUN: reopen courts",
          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nStriking Judiciary and Parliamentary workers were on Tuesday asked to return to their duty posts.\n\nThe Federal Government said the reopening of the courtrooms by Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Houses of Assembly by Parliamentary Staff Associations of Nigeria (PASAN) will pave the way for the implementation of the Memorandum of Action (MoA) signed on May 20.\n\nThe MoA was reinforced at another meeting on June 4.\n\nThis was the outcome of Tuesday\u2019s parley of the Presidential Implementation Committee on the Autonomy for the Judiciary and Legislature with stakeholders and how to end the JUSUN strike.\n\nOther stakeholders at the meeting are: the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad, members of the National Judicial Coouncil (NJC) and JUSUN representatives.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja by spokesman of his ministry, Charles Akpan, Labour and Employment Minister, Dr. Chris Ngige decried a situation where the courts and the Legislature Chambers remained shut down across the country for no cogent reasons of non-adherence to the provisions of the May 20 Memorandum of Action, which has 45 days implementation window.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe Federal Government has sadly noted that the MOA between all the stakeholders involved in the JUSUN/PASAN strike, mainly JUSUN/PASAN, Governors\u2019 Forum and the Presidential Implementation Committee is yet to take effect because of non-compliance by parties.\n\n\u201cWe note that the strike has not been called off as of noon, today, June 8, 2021, leading to courts and various Houses of Assembly still remaining under lock and key, contrary to the promise made by the two unions at a further dialogue which was attended by the President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC).\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all Federal courts have remained closed, notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Government operates a financial autonomy of the Judiciary through the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the National Assembly through the statutory transfer lines.\u201d\n\nThe statement noted that many governors were desirous that the state Assemblies be opened so that they could enact the laws meant to give effect to the autonomy as enshrined in the MOA.\n\nIt added: \u201cBut we have advised all governors that have consulted with their heads of Judiciary and Legislature to go ahead and credit the accounts of Judiciary and Legislature before finetuning the laws.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said: \u201cWe are worried and, therefore, wish to appeal for the last time to all parties involved in the signed agreement to abide by its spirit and letters, by firstly reopening all the courts and the Houses of Assembly so that all other ingredients in the MOA can be given full compliance by all parties concerned.\n\n\u201cThis much was agreed to between JUSUN/PASSAN and the Governors\u2019 Forum at the last meeting on Friday, June 4, 2021.\u201d\n\nNgige noted that with the courts closed, the police and other security agencies cannot prosecute criminals, hoodlums and bandits, even as the nation is faced with heightened insecurity.\n\nThe statement said the Ministry of Labour and Employment would not be happy to be pushed into invoking sections of the Trade Disputes Acts capable of eroding all the gains made so far in the negotiations since May 6, 2021.\n\nThe presidential panel\u2019s parley also focused on how to reopen the courts nationwide because of the increasing number of suspects awaiting trial.\n\nThe CJN also pleaded with JUSUN to shelve its strike because of outstanding cases.\n\nBut JUSUN insisted on meeting today to weigh all options, including its adamant stance that governors must deposit statutory transfers from the Federation Account for April.\n\nAs at last Friday, all the parties, including the governors, had signed the agreement on autonomy.\n\nIt was learnt that the only outstanding issue is the reopening of the courts and Houses of Assembly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe latest development accounted for the meeting between the committee and the CJN.\n\nA source, who spoke in confidence on the meeting, said: \u201cAt the session, the Secretary of the Presidential Implementation Committee, Senator Ita Enang, briefed the NJC on the terms of agreement with the governors, JUSUN and PASAN.\n\n\u201cThe source said Enang appealed to the CJN and the NJC to prevail on JUSUN to call off its strike to give room for the implementation of the agreement, especially the enactment of enabling laws for autonomy for the Judiciary and the Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe PIC Secretary clarified that at the session without Judiciary and parliamentary workers returning to their desks, the financial implications of the autonomy for the two arms cannot be computed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said there is a 45-day window to address all the conditions attached to the agreement.\u201d\n\nAnother source said the CJN asked JUSUN to suspend their strike in order to allow justice to be served.\n\n\u201cHe said the Judiciary workers should have \u201cfaith in the agreement.\n\n\u201cMembers of the NJC at the meeting also prevailed on JUSUN leaders to save the Judiciary from the consequences of prolonged strike.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cThe PIC met with the Parliamentary Staff Union last week and extracted an undertaking that it will allow the agreement to work.\u201d\n\nAsked of the response of JUSUN, the source said:\u201d The union did not give any immediate commitment but it claimed that it will meet on Wednesday (today) to take a decision on the strike action.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that JUSUN may suspend the strike today(Wednesday) so that the courts can reopen nationwide.\u201d\n\nFollowing the issuance of Executive Order 10 for autonomy for the Legislature and the Judiciary, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) had faulted the order and protested to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIssues raised by the governors were referred to the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), who set up a committee headed by the Solicitor-General of the Federation, Mr. Dayo Akpata (SAN).\n\nAkpata\u2019s committee was able to \u201cestablish that it is within the powers of the President to issue an Executive Order, including EO10.",

Anyone that has lost a close relative knows what it means to lose parents or children. I am more concerned about the lives lost because of the trickle down effects on families.\n\n\u201cOur people are not known for burning homes to punish enemies. Destroying police stations and infrastructures can never be the best path to express grievances. Whenever the 1967 \u2013 1970 civil war is mentioned, it\u2019s an emotive experience for any peace loving Nigerian not just an Igbo man.\n\nContinuing, he said \u201cWe should not either by words or actions pursue a repetition of that horrible genocide. We should come to understand that every war ends on a table. Instead of destructions before coming to the table, is it not wiser to come to table and avoid destruction? We need infrastructure, we need investments, we don\u2019t need hostilities. So we are pleading with you to stop and embrace peace,\u201c he said.\n\nOn the killing of innocent young people, kalu charged the security agencies to desist from harassment , molestation and killing of innocent young people in the region.\n\nHe said he is worried that some security agents have been reported to be killing innocent souls .\n\n\u201c It is better to thoroughly conduct your investigations and avoid the indiscriminate killings of young innocent Igbo men . Our people have raised alarm and we are very worried at the rate of disappearance and deaths of innocent young men . Some of our young people now live indoors for the fear of being tagged unknown gun man \u201c He said\n\nThe Chief Whip also reaffirmed his call for a national dialogue chaired by the President.\n\nHe noted that the need for a national dialogue is eminent to douse tensions in the country .\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way , our entanglement is so deep that all we need is diligent and deliberate efforts to realize the great dividends of diversity and pluralism. Our unity is our strength and can forever live in unity notwithstanding the diversity in culture, religion and tongues. A dialogue that has all stakeholders on the table and the president chairing it will go a long way in dousing tension across regions .\u201d Kalu said",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFour days after the Federal Government slammed indefinite ban on use of Twitter, prominent Nigerians have continued to flout the order.\n\nThose who have dared the FG include Governors of Kaduna and Ondo states, Nasir El-Rufai and Rotimi Akeredolu respectively, former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose and senators Dino Melaye and Shehu Sani\n\nGovernment had on Friday imposed suspension on Twitter alleging persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the ban on activities of the microblogging platform by Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, Minister of Justice and AGF, Abubakar Malami have directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) in his office to swing into action and commence the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government\u2019s de-activation of operations of Twitter\n\nBut prominent clerics, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Enoch Adeboye and the General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi, yesterday, posted separate tweets reacting to the ban of the microblogging platform.\n\nAdeboye said tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of human rights.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 Nations & Territories. The tweets here are in accordance to Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of Human Rights,\u201d the cleric tweeted.\n\nExplaining why Deeper Life Church would remain active on Twitter, Kumuyi said his tweets were targetted at over 100 nations where the church has branches. He said the church made use of Twitter to share contents from any of the locations across the five continents.\n\n\u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMocking the FG last night, Shehu Sani tweeted: \u201cYou have to come to Twitter to know who is in Twitter and coming is a Taboo.\u201d\n\nAlso defying the order, yesterday, Ayodele Fayose tweeted: \u201cAnyone they arrest will only end up being celebrated. No one should be moved by empty threats of arrest. Certainly, what has a beginning must have an end. This dictatorial govt came and shall definitely go. No shaking!\n\n\u201cGood days ahead\u201d while Melaye agreed with Pastor Adeboye that \u201cUnited Nations Charter of which Nigeria is a signatory and have since domesticated.\u201d\n\nEarlier, El-Rufai and Akeredolu, both members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), had tweeted through their verified accounts, daring Malami\u2019s prosecution threats. At exactly 9:37 p.m. on Sunday, Kaduna governor shared an opinion article titled: \u201cBased Nigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny\u201d.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu also posted a statement reacting to the night attack that claimed several lives in Igangan community in Oyo State on Sunday.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai\u2019s media aide, Muyiwa Adekeye said he had been outside the country for over a week, noting, \u201cthe activities of Twitter is not banned in the country.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson of Governor Akeredolu, Olabode Richard, also argued that the microblogging platform was accessible to Nigerians on Sunday, adding that his principal did not make use of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other alternatives being explored by Nigerians.\n\nIt, however, remains unclear if the order from the office of the AGF would be effected on, Adeboye, El-Rufai, Akeredolu and other \u201coffenders\u201d.\n\n\u2022FG could have handled it a lot better, says Sanwo-Olu\n\nSpeaking on a live television interview programme, yesterday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said considering the economic implications of the decision, the Federal Government could have handled the situation better.\n\n\u201cFederal government can handle this a lot better. Because of the number of eCommerce, the number of youths doing digital stuff on the internet, and we cannot throw that away and say it\u2019s not happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cOn both sides, there are issues that can be resolved between Twitter and the government and I think what they\u2019ve done is not a ban but a suspension like they said, so in the period of suspension let us sit down.\n\n\u201cIf we have 40 million users of that micro-blogger and another country has five million and they chose to take their investment to a country that have five million compared to a country with 40 million. It speaks to the reason we need to have that conversation with them. Probably if they have an office here things would have been done a lot quicker and better.\u201d\n\n\u2022Envoys maintain position on ban\n\nFederal Government, yesterday, met envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Canadian Government and the Government of Ireland over their response to its ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThe meeting which was at the instance of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, followed a statement jointly issued by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian Government, and the Republic of Ireland at the weekend, expressing disappointment over the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations.\n\nPrior to the joint statement, the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, had issued a separate statement where it said the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\nPresent at the meeting were the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard; the British Deputy High commissioner, Gill Atkinson; Canadian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Nicolas Simard; the Political Adviser on Maritime and Security, Politics, Press and Information Section, Delegation of European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Thomas Kieler; and the Charge d\u2019Affaires of the Embassy of Ireland, Mr Conor Finn.\n\nOnyeama said the meeting was as a result of the statement jointly issued by the missions which was forwarded to him.\n\nOnyeama further said he felt it was absolutely appropriate to take their comments very seriously and meet with the heads of missions due to the respect for their countries and in view of the relationship with the affected countries.\n\nHe also said the meeting was in their usual friendly way, to discuss and share opinions with respect to the Twitter ban and clarify certain things.\n\n\u201cSo, it was for that reason that I have invited you here this morning, not summon, invited to discuss some of these issues,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nResponding on behalf of other envoys, Leonard said as partners, they want to see Nigeria succeed, unified, peaceful and prosperous.\n\nAsked if they were withdrawing their statement, Leonard said they recognised that there were issues of irresponsible use of social media, but \u201cwe remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express oneself is actually very important, and perhaps, even more important in troubled times.\u201d\n\n\u2022FG to sanction broadcast stations using Twitter\n\nThe Federal Government has directed broadcast stations to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in programmes.\n\nThe directive was issued in Abuja by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in a statement by its Acting Director-General, Professor Armstrong Idachaba.\n\nNBC said it would be unpatriotic for any broadcaster to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information.\n\n\u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of User Generated Content (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) r of the NBC Act entrusts the commission with responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, section 3.11.2 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u2018the broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than Crime and Anarchy,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\nIdachaba further said attention was also drawn to Section 5.6.3 of the Broadcast Code which required broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a UGC.\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\n\u2022Asking TV, radio stations to deactivate accounts unlawful \u2013 SERAP\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has condemned the directive by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to all broadcast stations in the country to suspend patronage of Twitter with immediate effect as \u201cthe patently unlawful and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNBC had reportedly stated that the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over purported use of the platform for \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSERAP in a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare said the directive by the NBC is itself unlawful because it is based on another unlawful decision by the Federal Government to suspend Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe NBC\u2019s directive has political interference written all over it. It is a blow to Nigerians\u2019 rights to freedom of expression, media freedom, media independence and diversity. The directive must be immediately withdrawn. Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right. This action by the NBC is yet another nail in the coffin for human rights, media freedom and independent journalism under this government.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should publicly and vigorously express concerns over the Nigerian government\u2019s increasingly brutal crackdown on media freedom, and use all possible means to urge the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to protect and respect freedom of expression.\u201d\n\n\u2022Stop mocking democracy, Norsemen tell FG\n\nAn international humanitarian body, De Norsemen KClub International has kicked against the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter, saying it was an ambush on the nation\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\nThe group said the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was mocking democracy, adding that it was appalled that a government that came in through a democratic process, and prided itself as an upholder of democratic principles, could take such brazing unpopular decision without recourse to democratic principles and constitutionality.\n\nIn statement by it International President, Dr. Adeshola Giwa, on Monday, De Norsemen stated its belief and commitment to free speech, noting that only a government that had something to hide would abridge freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cDe Norsemen Kclub International wish to remind the Federal Government that a government that has nothing to hide is not afraid of free speech. The rule should be: let the people express themselves and take responsibility of their expressions. We want to emphasize that freedom of speech is an inalienable constitutional right of citizens. Citizens\u2019 right to free expression is non-negotiable and it is only a court of competent jurisdiction, and not the fiat of government, that can determine when the expression of citizens runs foul of the law.\u201d",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Imo state Commissioner of police, Abutu Yaro, has ordered a thorough investigation into the alleged killing of a German-based Nigerian, Oguchi Unachukwu, who was said to have been shot by the personnel of the 211 regiment of the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThe deceased and his family were said to be on their way to catch a flight at the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo airport, Owerri, to Lagos, for an onward movement to Humburg, Germany, when he was shot at the tollgate of the airport, on May 31.\n\nThe CP, sequel to the call by the widow of the slain Unachukwu, Mrs Ijeoma Unachukwu, and other concerned citizens, to ensure that the killers did not go unpunished, swiftly commenced investigation into the killing.\n\nThe CP, in a statement issued by the command\u2019s Spokesperson, Bala Elkana, assured that his office would ensure that justice prevailed.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Commissioner of Police Imo State Command, Abutu Yaro, has ordered an in-depth investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of one Uguchi Unachukwu \u2018m\u2019 near the toll gate of Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, on May 31, 2021, at about 0804 hours.\n\n\u201cThe deceased person is alleged to have been shot by personnel suspected to be staff of 211 Regiment of the Nigerian Air Force, responsible for the security of the International Airport. The deceased was said to be on his way to catch a flight to Lagos. A survivor stated that one of the Air Force operatives shot the car of Oguchi when he failed to stop at the Air Force checkpoint after they had flagged him down.\n\n\u201cFollowing the information, the Air Force team at the toll gate, who were already on red alert, especially considering the recent killing of a high profile politician around the same area, intercepted a fast approaching Mercedes Benz vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey flagged down the vehicle and ordered the driver to park by the roadside for search, but the driver who, at first, slowed down and pretended to move to the side of the road, suddenly took off.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Air Force, being suspicious of the mission of the occupants of the said vehicle at the International Airport, they made an effort to demobilise the vehicle. When the vehicle eventually came to a halt, the operatives rounded it and ordered the occupants out.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that a female passenger in the car mentioned that the man driving the vehicle was her husband and that he was rushing to catch his flight. He was, however, rushed to the hospital by the Air Force team for medical attention, where the doctors on duty made frantic efforts to stabilise him. He later died at about 1900 hours of the same date.\n\n\u201cImo State Police Command has commenced investigation into the case. The Commissioner of Police called for calm and assured family and friends of the deceased person that no stone will be left unturned in unravelling the circumstances surrounding the death. Members of the public will be updated on the outcome of the investigation.\u201d Yaro stated.",

          "text": "\u2022Govt communication system in shambles as agencies return to old, archaic mode of information dissemination\n\n\u2022Buhari, Osinbajo, MDAs suspend tweeting\n\n\u2022Akeredolu, el-Rufai, Makinde defy directive\n\nBy Chiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFederal government\u2019s suspension of the operation of American micro-blogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria, might have left both in a catch-22 situation as the duo have lost millions of followers that they had built for more than half a decade.\n\nFor Twitter the saga has cost it billions of cash, while Nigerians, in both private and public sectors have lost their means of instant communication.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had last week announced the suspension of Twitter after the firm deleted some aspects of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, which the company found to be in breach of its rules.\n\nFollowing searing attacks of the suspension by social activists, who said it was an abuse of Nigerians\u2019 freedom of expression as guaranteed by Section 39 (1) of the Constitution as altered, Muhammed added an extra reason for the act, saying the temporary prohibition of the internet platform was a response to the firm\u2019s persistent violation of the nation\u2019s national security interest.\n\nThe suspension order had attracted a directive from the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), asking all Telcos and broadcasting media to deactivate their Twitter handles and block access to the internet facility.\n\nMany Nigerians, have, however, circumvented the federal government\u2019s blockage of the micro-blogging facility, resorting to the virtual private network (VPN) to connect Twitter.\n\nAlthough THISDAY\u2019s checks showed that Buhari, his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and many government agencies, including the armed forces, ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), have suspended tweeting, some governors including Malam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) and Mr. Seyi Makinde (Oyo) have continued to tweet in defiance of the federal government\u2019s directive.\n\nAnalysts, however, told THISDAY yesterday that both the federal government and Twitter must be feeling the rough edges of the suspension as they suffer its adverse effect.\n\nFor the Nigerian government, its agencies and millions of private sector users of the micro-blogging facility, it amounts to a loss of an instant communication tool, which had helped to facilitate the dissemination and receipt of information necessary for the conduct of their businesses.\n\nBuhari, for instance, said an analyst, has lost millions of his followers that it has taken him six years to build. \u201cHe may have to start afresh when he returns to the site,\u201d he said.\n\nAgencies like Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that had used its Twitter handle to instantly communicate with the public information on the COVID-19 pandemic, would now have to revert to other pre-Twitter messaging platforms, including e-mail, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram that are not as fast, another analyst explained last night.\n\nA day after Mohammed announced the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, had warned that violators of the ban would be prosecuted.\n\nBut senior lawyers have questioned the legality of Malami\u2019s order, saying that it is not grounded in law, adding that Nigerians could not be prosecuted for offences not specified by law.\n\nTo calm the global outrage that the suspension of Twitter has generated, the federal government yesterday met with ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland in Nigeria and sought their understanding on its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nBut save for the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, who deactivated her Twitter handle following the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in the country, Buhari, Osinbajo and some other top government officials still retained their accounts, although they\u2019re inactive.\n\nHowever, the federal government\u2019s directive suspending Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was silent on whether or not Nigerians should deactivate their accounts.\n\nBut a directive yesterday by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) had directed road and television stations in the country to de-install their Twitter accounts.\n\nChecks by THISDAY yesterday showed that Twitter accounts belonging to government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are also being retained.\n\nSome of the accounts being retained belong to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Chief Geoffrey Onyema; Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).\n\nOthers include the Nigerian Police, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the\n\nSuper Eagles, the official Twitter account of Nigerian football team; and the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), among many others.\n\nWhile most of these accounts are not active, the same cannot be said of their aides who have bypassed the networks to tweet with their Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\nAlso active are Twitter accounts of former Senators Shehu Sani and Dino Melaye, as well as el-Rufai who tweeted the link of a story on \u201cNigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny \u2014 RT Op-ed.\u201d\n\nWhile Akeredolu\u2019s last tweet, on the attack on Igangan community in Oyo State was at 7.11 pm on Sunday, Makinde, at 9.45 am, on Sunday, tweeted to urge for calm over the attack on Igangan.\n\nAlso, most churches are still active on Twitter with both Deeper Life Bible Church and Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), justifying their accounts being active on the grounds that they need to reach congregants in other countries.\n\nThe RCCG, in a clarification, said: \u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 nations & territories. The tweets here are in accordance with Article 19 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d\n\nArticle 19 of the UDHR said: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Deeper Life General Overseer, Pastor Williams Kumuyi said: \u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations.\u201d\n\nFG Seeks Support of US, UK, Others over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nThe federal government yesterday sought the understanding of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland over its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt, however, gave conditions to lift the suspension.\n\nAlso yesterday, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, called for a speedy resolution of the dispute.\n\nAddressing a press conference after a meeting with the five representatives of the missions in Abuja, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Onyeama, said they had a discussion concerning the issues of Twitter ban and based on the joint press statement earlier made by the missions.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had a useful discussion with the countries that are considered to be close friends and partners of Nigeria. We sat down and reviewed the whole situation and we stated the security concern of Mr. President and the whole Nigerians and the very strong steps we\u2019ve taken to address the security challenges of the country.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said they presented first-hand information about the security challenges of the country and also the role of the social media.\n\nHe stated that social media is good for dissemination of information, but it can also be used for good and the bad.\n\nHe added that the bad side of it has dire consequences on human lives and property.\n\nAccording to him, it is germane to keep the unity of the country and to achieve all these, a decision has to be taken and measures put in place to ensure the social platforms are used responsibly.\n\nHe said as a democracy, the issue of fundamental human rights was expected to be respected, especially freedom of speech, adding that this should not be allowed to bring the country down.\n\nHe stated that the five missions and their countries have been supporting Nigeria even with its security and development challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been having partnership and solidarity with the five countries. They have supported us very strongly in our security challenges, humanitarian crisis, development challenges and economic challenges, so we can say that these countries are our partners. We are asking them to also support us as we continue to confront all these challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to them and they also have their views on all of these issues and we gave them the opportunities to also expressed themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly gratified with the statement and reassurance of support and friendship towards Nigeria. We have to keep an eye on the main objective of this government, when Mr. President was elected, security was number one of his priorities and it is something he really wants to be able to deliver for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout security, everything else fails, investments go out of the country, regular migration out, it will be a vicious cycle.\n\n\u201cWe will all be losers and our children, generation to come will all be affected. What we do today will really determine the future of this country. That is why this government gives priority to security, that this government would have to live in peace and security. And we have to keep our country together.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today, will really define the future of the country and that is why Mr. \u201cPresident is absolutely determined that security has been made and Nigerians have to live in peace and security and that we have to keep our country together. We listened to each other and clarified some areas.\u201d\n\nOnyeama, however, said the government was already discussing with Twitter on lifting the suspension.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you yourself have said, discussions are ongoing with Twitter, we want to see how that progresses. So I cannot say for now the duration of the suspension. There are conversations with our partners and with social media.\n\n\u201cThe basic condition is really responsible communication. We know the power of words and the power of words for good and the power of words for bad. You know when you have that kind of power to manage and facilitate the communication of billions of people around the world; it has to come with responsibilities. Absolutely, it has to come with responsibilities. So the condition will be a responsible use of media and that really has to be adhered to.\u201d\n\nIn her response on behalf of the five missions, the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth- Leonard, said: \u201cI will say that first of all that we recognise that there are issues of responsible use of social media but we remain firm on our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important perhaps on one part, but also at trouble times.\u201d\n\nShe urged Nigeria to identify those who commit crimes and use judicial processes to deal with offenders, adding \u201cbut to constrain, that is not the behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe envoy added that they were glad to hear that Nigeria was interacting with Twitter.\n\nOn the challenges confronting the country, she said: \u201cI think we made that statement very clear that we are Nigeria\u2019s strong partners. We recognise the daunting times in the area of security challenges that confronts Nigeria. Well, they are daunting, they are not insurmountable and part of the way you surmount them is through partnership.\u201d\n\nThe federal government had earlier summoned the envoys over their recent comments on the suspension.\n\nThe missions had in a joint statement condemned the suspension.\n\nNBC Orders Broadcast Stations to Suspend Twitter Patronage\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has ordered all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter with immediate effect.\n\nNBC said the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that could undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nThe acting Director-General of the NBC, Prof. Armstrong Idachaba, in a statement directed the broadcast stations to \u201cde-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) of the NBC Act entrusts the Commission with the responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, Section 3.11.2 of Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than crime and anarchy.\n\n\u201cAttention is also drawn to section 5.6.3 of the Code which requires Broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite panic or rift in the society in the use of user-generated content (UGC).\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Uneasy Calm over Buni\u2019s Alleged Plans for APC Chairmanship",
          "text": "\u2022Media aide dismisses speculation\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThere is rising tension in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) following an alleged plan by the Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, to transmute to the national chairman of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Buni\u2019s alleged ambition may have stopped the caretaker committee from announcing dates for national and states congresses in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to usher in new party leadership.\n\nSources familiar with the power game in the party told THISDAY that Buni\u2019s game plan is to resign his position as governor and join the race for the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nHe\u2019s billed to end second term tenure in May 2023.\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the claim, saying he has no intention to resign his position as governor.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given up to this month to conduct a national convention and states\u2019 congresses after a reconciliation of the members as well as the revalidation of membership registers.\n\nThe sources said a self-succession motive by Buni to become the substantive national chairman is currently stalling moves to hold a national convention.\n\nHowever, many of the governors elected on the platform of the party are said to be opposed to Buni\u2019s bid to transform into the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nThe APC governors opposed to the Buni\u2019s ambition, it was learnt, are those who would be rounding off their second term in office by 2023.\n\nAlso, the ministers who have political ambitions by 2023 are opposed to the transmutation plans of Buni and some selected members of the APC caretaker committee.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party would soon be summoned.\n\nA special NEC meeting of the APC in June 2020 had appointed Buni, a former national secretary of the party, as chairman of the caretaker committee following the leadership crisis triggered by the suspension of the then National Chairman of the party, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given a six-month mandate to organise a convention that would elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nBut the committee sought and was granted a six-month extension to complete its mandate.\n\nBut after 12 months in office, no date has been announced for the election of the executive committee members.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Buni-led caretaker committee has begun to plan another meeting of NEC to seek an elongation of its tenure.\n\nA member of the committee that spoke to THISDAY in confidence said there is a plot for the Buni committee to seek an elongation or an outright self-perpetuation of members in office.\n\nThe argument, the source said, would be that an election from ward to states and eventually, national convention in the party would further divide the party at a time when it should be consolidating in the states ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was against this backdrop that some committee members, albeit with the consent of Buni, were considering presenting to the NEC that he should rather resign as governor and continue at the national convention, where he would be affirmed as the substantive national chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that since his emergence as caretaker committee chairman, Buni has not spent up to four days a week in Yobe State as he stays in Abuja most of the time.\n\nBefore winning the election to become the governor, he was the national secretary of APC when Oshiomhole was the national chairman.\n\n\u201cAlthough this has not been tabled before the NEC, members of the party, who should know, were already protesting against the idea of members self-perpetuating themselves under any guise,\u201d the source said.\n\nSome of the APC members who did not want to be quoted said they had concluded plans to seek legal action against any plans by the committee members to self-perpetuate themselves in office.\n\nAnother member told THISDAY that the Buni committee has already overstayed its welcome.\n\nA member of the committee also confirmed the self-succession bid, saying: \u201cWe were appointed to right the wrongs of Adams Oshiomhole, and not this idea of not announcing the dates for the wards, local government, states and national convention.\n\n\u201cAnything outside announcing the dates of the national convention and other dates for the states congresses is outside our mandate. If by the next month, there is no date announced for the elections, I will speak out and also resign. What is happening is not our mandate.\n\n\u201cWe were appointed in June 2020 and our mandate was renewed in December to end in June. Any further plan to seek an extension or perpetuate us in office, count me out.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the allegation of self- perpetuation, saying he has no intention to resign his position as the governor of Yobe State to become the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nBuni\u2019s Director of Media, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, said he already has a job, and he is not looking for another one.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a blatant lie; it is just a fabrication. The governor has a job, which he\u2019s doing and he is not looking for any other job. It is not even worth responding because it does not even get an inch close to anything obtainable with the governor.\n\n\u201cThe task before him is to build a viable and vibrant political party; organise a very successful congress and convention and handover the party to elected officials.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted yesterday on the purported plan to convey NEC meeting of the party to seek further extension, the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nBut a party source, who pleaded anonymity, told THISDAY that conducting party congresses and convention this month was not feasible, as there is no road map.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president has not agreed with what the caretaker committee is trying to do as regards another elongation. The president is still adamant, he has not said anything. He is waiting for them to convince him.\n\n\u201cIf we want to conduct the congress, it starts from the ward to the local government to the state. It is those who emerge from these congresses that will form the national delegates to the convention. But we have not done any of this and there is no date scheduled for it at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe party source added ward congress will take a week or two, same as local government congresses and state congresses.\n\nHe said there would also be an appeal for ward, local and state congresses which would take two weeks each.\n\nThe source added: \u201cNow we are in Lagos to authenticate the membership register for it to be used for the primary election, which we are in the process. We have done that of Ogun, we are now in Lagos. We have not authenticated that of other states, how do you now expect a congress to come up.\u201d\n\nAsked if the membership register was authenticated by the party officials before the primary, he replied: \u201cThey didn\u2019t use it, they by-passed it. If there is any litigation against them, they will win in court. They didn\u2019t use the approved membership register; they falsified the one they used. Even in Abeokuta, they are falsified.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that there is no way the party can conduct congress without authenticating and finalising the registration of new members.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Anyone who has been involved in security at any level will tell you that policing is local,\u201d Makinde said, according to a statement by Taiwo Adisa, his spokesman.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why the Western Nigeria Security Network, code-named Amotekun, is recording success is because members of the corps are drawn from the locality. They know the terrain and so can gather needed intelligence. Also, they can be held accountable by the local people.\n\n\u201cWhen the state governors become the actual Chief Security Officers in charge of the security personnel in their state, they can quickly respond to security challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYes, we will continue to do our best. We were able to get Amotekun off the ground and it is in operation now. But there are several limitations to what Amotekun can do right now, and the types of firearms they can carry. If we are given the authority and licence, I will also buy AK-47 rifles for Amotekun.\n\n\u201cSo, these are just two areas where true federalism will bring greater economic benefits and development to Nigerian states.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of devolution of powers, Makinde stated that fiscal federalism remains the only way to take Nigeria away from the edge of the precipice.\n\nHe said true federalism is the future of democracy in the country, adding that Nigeria must devolve powers to the federating units, especially as it relates to controlling natural resources and security architecture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso at the summit were Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, who was represented by Charles Titiloye, the state\u2019s attorney-general; Osariemen Osunbor, former governor of Edo; and Eghosa Osagie, director-general of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA).",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a resolution to investigate the legality of the suspension of Twitter in the country. Announced on Friday, the controversial decision has stoked national conversations and attracted international criticism over the last few days.\n\nThe investigation by lawmakers represents the first major move by the legislative body on the suspension of Twitter and comes after widespread criticism from Nigerians over the silence and inaction of the National Assembly since the ban was imposed.\n\nMembers of the lower chamber have been \u201cinundated with comments about the decision (suspending Twitter), requests for intervention and criticism\u201d since the announcement, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, said during the resumption of the plenary session of the House in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the House recognises that Twitter, like other social media networks, is an important tool for communication and commerce in Nigeria \u201cparticularly amongst the younger generation who have used these networks for enterprise and innovation with great success.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker however cautioned that although the social media platform is a very important means of communication and business for the younger generation of Nigerians, the government has a responsibility to ensure it is not used to undermine national security even as lawmakers must see to it that government policies are in line with the law and without adverse consequences on the people.\n\nAs part of the investigation that will be carried out by the House Committees on Communication, Justice, Information & Culture, and National Security & Intelligence, the Minister of Culture & Information, Lai Mohammed, has been invited to brief the House on the objectives, intent, and duration of the suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe committees are expected to question Lai Mohammed and report to the House within 10 days to guide further action by the lawmakers on the matter, Gbajabiamila said.\n\nThe embattled minister who announced the suspension of Twitter, cited a \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d as reason for the ban. The U.S. social media giant has said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the ban.\n\nNigerians continue to use Twitter, however, thanks to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that have helped bypass the ban. In response, the Nigerian Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has ordered the immediate prosecution of people still making use of the microblogging platform. The country\u2019s broadcast regulator has also ordered television and radio stations to suspend their use of Twitter.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. Wuri Ventures and Capria Ventures also participated investing $1.5m. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming. The successful expansion of WhereIsMyTransport would reduce friction in the movement of people and goods across Africa and other emerging markets.",

          "text": "HELPING AFRICAN CONSUMERS SEND AND RECEIVE AS LITTLE AS $1 USING CRYPTO\n\n\u2013 FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD \u2013\n\nEasyShare; a fast, reliable, and super affordable way to send and receive money to anyone in Africa using crypto has officially launched in beta mode in Africa.\n\nBy using innovative low-cost crypto-technology to drastically cut transaction fees, Easyshare will also allow consumers to perform micro-transactions safely, securely and affordably.\n\nSpeaking on the launch of the beta platform, Ben Onuoha Co-founder and Head of Partnerships & Community at EasyShare.Africa said, \u201cEasyshare was born out of a lot of research. Bitcoin and Ethereum have definitely offered more people access to the global financial system \u2014 but African consumers have repeatedly told us that Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be way too expensive to use in many cases, and it is therefore, not necessarily the answer for the financial needs of all communities. More African Bitcoin and Ethereum users are increasingly using other cryptocurrencies which offer better value for money\u201d\n\nOnuoha added: \u201cIn response to consumer demand, we are solely focused on the ease of sending and receiving value through cryptocurrency using the most affordable means. Our vision is to bring Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to low and middle income countries where remittances account for 5% or more of GDP and make these DeFi services more accessible.\u201d\n\nThe threshold for sending and receiving money using crypto on EasyShare.Africa is capped at a maximum of US$2,500 per transaction and a minimum of US$1. Users can seamlessly send money to a mobile wallet or bank account using crypto in five easy steps. EasyShare.Africa supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT ERC20) and other low transaction cost cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin (BNB), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT TRC20) and Tron (TRX). More cryptocurrency options will be added in due course.\n\nThe Easyshare.Africa platform is crowdsourcing to meet its expansion plans\n\nIn addition to serving ordinary consumers, Easyshare.Africa is committed to extending its impact, by pioneering the world\u2019s first decentralized network of verified peer to peer crypto-powered remittance agents. Current crypto remittance systems and peer to peer platforms use centralized escrows to guarantee settlement. This centralized escrow model is oftentimes plagued with bad actors, as well as centralized judges and juries settling disputes. EasyShare.Africa improves on this crypto peer-to-peer remittance model by adding a decentralized layer where verified remittance agents can stake SHARE Token \u2013 the native crypto of the Easyshare ecosystem \u2013 as collateral/insurance to guarantee the agents complete transactions.\n\nThe Easyshare model is poised to contribute to eight out of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by making a case for the unbanked and underbanked through offering various services such as micro remittances, microfinance loans, savings, insurance, payments, e-commerce and more for low-income populations in Africa and other emerging markets.

          "text": "Digital transformation has reinforced the importance of investing in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset monitoring, data collection, and decision making, to maximize value from operational assets in advanced and emerging economies.\n\nLagos, Nigeria: Today, PlugnPlay IoT, a subsidiary of NovaTrack Limited announced that it will be organizing a private Asset Tracking seminar in Lagos, Nigeria that will discuss the importance, necessity, and the \u2018how\u2019 of adopting the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology for business advancement, especially in emerging economies through digital transformation focused on asset management and tracking.\n\nThe seminar, as part of the PlugnPlay IoT measures to help businesses in emerging economies scale by revealing how businesses, regardless of size can reduce operational cost in the areas of asset maintenance, security, data collection, etc., will be held this year, precisely on the 15 June 2021.\n\nAs rightly stated by PlugnPlay IoT, \u201cthe recent security challenges in major African economies, especially Nigeria highlight the need for increased security protocols for valuables. In the case of businesses, these valuables are referred to as company assets. These are infrastructure, equipment, or personnel that have some reasonable and clear lifetime value pegged on them. Aside from security, businesses that wish to stand strong through time naturally seek to improve operational processes, especially with technology and innovation that provides an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\nHowever, some business assets may not deliver direct value but will have other processes or operations dependent on their indirect value. Such business assets are often mistaken for less important but they should be secured to avoid or reduce unwanted events like operational downtimes which may lead to loss of trust and reduced work efficiency all of which runs down any business.\u201d\n\nThese challenges are common to all; Oil & Gas, Construction, Manufacturing, Financial Services, Logistics, Energy Supply and Distribution, Facility Management, etc., and there is always a place for IoT to satisfy these. Industries like these have been seen to speedily displace entities that fail to evolve with technological advantages because advancements such as IoT drastically improves operational success and reduces risk while increasing customer satisfaction. For example, the advent of GPS tracking revolutionized the logistics sector, and those able to perfectly fit it into business processes now lead the industry. This is why PlugnPlay IoT has put together the Asset Tracking 101 Seminar to present industry leaders who participate with the unfair advantage of business asset tracking with IoT technology.\n\nA representative of PlugnPlay IoT also mentioned that \u201cthe seminar, to be held on June 15, will privately engage high-level participants from both the public and private sector; CEOs, CTOs, CIOs, Senior Managers, Government Heads, and will focus on the key issues surrounding business innovation and the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for asset tracking to increase profitability and boost economic prosperity.\u201d The program will include training and updates on new products/solutions with speeches delivered by highly ranked business leaders in Nigeria and as a private event, it is strictly on invitation. However, business leaders who consider themselves qualified to participate can request to attend on their webpage.\n\nAbout PlugnPlay IoTPlugnPlayIoT is an IoT service provider, powered by NovaTrack Ltd, that empowers system integrators, technology experts, software developers and entrepreneurs to build and scale their own IoT business verticals at a relatively low cost. Our solutions enable our channel partners to deploy wireless connected sensors with remote monitoring capability, data analytics and real-time alerts for various industry applications.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nUberX Hourly launches in Nigeria\n\nMoneyHash pre-seed investment round\n\nUpdates on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\n\nUber Launches UberX Hourly in Nigeria\n\nOn Monday, June 7, 2021, US-based ride-hailing platform, Uber, announced the official launch of UberX Hourly in Nigeria.\n\nWith this new feature, riders can stop at multiple locations to carry out activities without requesting several rides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that you can book a ride to an event centre but also stop by the pharmacy to get drugs or the supermarket to grab a few things with the same ride. Of course, you can\u2019t do all that with the initial amount paid.\n\nHow it works is, on the Uber app, you can order a ride as usual, but this time, you\u2019d select an Hourly Driver. Then, put in your destination and send your driver an in-app message to discuss how much time you think you might spend on all trips. Upfront charges are based on the minimum per hour, and consequently, per minutes.\n\nThis launch follows a warning strike action carried out by Bolt and Uber riders under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA) in April and a 13% increase in fares in Lagos in May.\n\nBefore now, UberX Hourly was only available in Africa in Tanzania\u2019s largest city, Dar Es Salaam. According to Uber\u2019s Country Manager for Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, the warm reception of the product by both riders and users in that city reflects its viability and scalability in Nigeria. .\n\nEven if there is some excitement about the feature in the country, the drivers\u2019 concerns haven\u2019t been addressed. Time will tell how affordable UberX Hourly will be.\n\nMoneyHash raises undisclosed pre-seed round\n\nL-R MoneyHash co-founders Nader Abdelrazik, Anisha Sekar and Mustafa Eid. Source:The Capital Quest\n\nEgypt-based fintech startup, MoneyHash, raised an undisclosed pre-seed investment on Monday, June 7,2021. The round was led by COTU ventures, a leading seed-stage venture firm in the Middle East.\n\nOther investors in the round include Kepple Africa Ventures, Nigeria-based early-stage VC, Ventures Platform, and some angel investors.\n\nThe startup is currently building an API to help businesses access all payments and fintech services across the Middle East region. This will help eCommerce merchants provide users with a seamless experience during checkout and create a compact user database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Nader Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash launched in December 2020. The app is currently running a private beta mode. The funding will be put towards a public launch, product development, and team growth.\n\nIt goes to say that more startups realise the necessity of fintech platforms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This should be no surprise as it\u2019s a region where only 40% of the population have access to bank accounts. The fintech and digital banking scene is plagued with issues like lack of a unified data system and payment integration; startups like MoneyHash are looking to provide viable solutions to these problems.\n\nStill on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\u2026\n\nA lot seems to have happened since the Federal Government of Nigeria banned the use of microblogging platform, Twitter, on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThe news was received with a bitter counteraction by a large number of the public, as it poses a threat to the core values of free speech and freedom of expression that are the bedrock of a democratic state.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to react to a wrong, and it is another to be aware of the facts as to why an action may be wrong or right.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo picked the brains of three lawyers to find out the legality of the directive. What\u2019s your guess?\n\nYou should check it out: #TwitterBan: Exploring the legal intricacies of Nigeria\u2019s decision\n\nThat\u2019s not all. In a bid to access Twitter, Nigerians currently have to resort to using Virtual Private Networks (VPN). Questions like \u201cShould all VPNs be trusted?\u201d have been asked.\n\nYou can find answers here: #TwitterBan: Should Nigerians be worried about VPNs?\n\nRemember, safety first!\n\nAnd in a latest development, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has given orders to broadcasting stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and desist from reporting to their audience via that platform.\n\nRead more: #TwitterBan: Nigerian TV, radio stations, others can no longer tweet or patronise Twitter\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government is reportedly drafting new rules that will mandate foreign companies like Twitter to get a licence before they can operate in the country.\n\nSmoke without fire? This Bloomberg article has it that the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, through his special assistant on Media, has denied that the government is planning to partner with China to build an Internet firewall. He calls it \u201ca figment of the reporter\u2019s imagination.\u201d\n\nWhile this gives some sort of relief, it\u2019s still clear that freedom of speech is under threat.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading:\n\nFaceTime is coming to Android and Windows via the web.

          "text": "China has announced a series of measures for high-quality development of public hospitals in the next five years, including providing medical resources to underdeveloped areas and improving public health emergency policies.\n\nDrawing lessons from the COVID-19 epidemic, the government has vowed to oversee the high-quality development of its 12,000 public hospitals over the next five years.\n\nThis offers a clue for Nigeria in easing the pressure often placed on big public hospitals in city centres by large population of those who rely on government facilities to offset treatment cost.\n\nFor years, the Chinese government has been advising people to seek treatment in nearby medical centres, instead of going to big hospitals in big cities.\n\nSince 2019, top public hospitals in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai have been encouraged to set up sub-branches in provinces that have a large population, but don\u2019t have advanced medical resources. And authorities say the plan has been working. The 10 pilot projects have helped patients get treatment in local hospitals.\n\nRead Also: Healthcare delivery suffers in Ondo as 105 medical doctors resign\n\n\u201cIn Henan, there\u2019s a sub-branch of Beijing Children\u2019s Hospital in the provincial capital Zhengzhou. In 2020, the province saw a big drop in the number of patients who went to the Children\u2019s Hospital in Beijing. The number of out-patients has dropped by 63 percent, and the number of hospitalized patients has dropped by 51 percent,\u201d said Sun Zhicheng, director of Social Development Department of the National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nThese sub-branches are called regional medical centres and will be expanded to all provinces by the end of next year. The government also requires every city to choose one comprehensive hospital to focus on the epidemic.\n\nHospitals specialising in infectious diseases will also receive support to improve their facilities. These are just part of the new blueprint.\n\nLi Bin, vice-minister of the National Health Commission, explained what the government aims to achieve in the next five years.\n\n\u201cPublic hospitals will focus on improving quality and efficiency rather than expanding in scale. Their operation and management will be more delicate and will focus on talents and technologies, instead of materials and equipment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll these measures aim to provide efficient medical services with high quality, and to prevent and fight major epidemics and public health emergencies. They\u2019ll support the construction of a healthy China,\u201d Li added.\n\nThe central government is requiring public hospitals to be better prepared for major epidemics.\n\nOne of the issues of concern to public health systems in Nigeria is that people often bypass secondary healthcare facilities to move cases directly to tertiary hospitals believed to be better equipped and managed experienced health experts.\n\nAlthough many secondary healthcare facilities run the Lagos state government for instance has at least a surgeon, obstetrician, gynaecologist, paediatrician and specialist equipment, resident still both in city centres and suburbs still overlook them due to delays in access and sometimes unavailable of the experts.\n\n\u201cPeople will not go to any of those secondary hospitals. They prefer to come to LASUTH. So, we are overs-subscribed. As we speak, we have over 37 medical emergency beds,\u201d Adetokunbo Fabamwo, chief medical director, Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) told BusinessDay earlier in an interview.",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, said his administration will continue to work for the people of Edo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn my first term, I promised to tar community roads in Ekosodin. I kept to my promise as a lot of work has been done in developing the area. We will continue to do more for the community.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on developing the State. I charge you to protect all government facilities and infrastructure in your community. I call on the community to own the process and not allow vandalism. If government\u2019s property is maintained, our unborn children and the coming generation will benefit from it.\u201d\n\nThe governor further assured them that his administration will partner the community in improving security, noting, \u201cSecurity requires collaborative effort. We all need to partner and ensure our state and the nation is safe for us all. When the state is safe and secure, investors will come in to develop the area.\n\n\u201cThe government plans to drop one of the power-line for 24/7 electricity in Ekosodin and establish an innovation hub in the area to empower the youths and artisans.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to partner with people of Ekosodin Community to make the area comfortable for our youths and students.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Odionwere of the community, Pa Samuel Aimufua, whose speech was read by the community\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Engr. Osayomwanbor James, commended the governor for the tremendous work done to develop the community.\n\nHe noted: \u201cSince 1970, when Samuel Ogbemudia established the University of Benin, we have suffered under-development, as several administrations did not look towards our direction. The present administration, led by Governor Godwin Obaseki came to the rescue. It has brought development to the people of Ekosodin Community in Ovia North-East.\u201d\n\nIn another engagement, Odolevbo O\u2019sioba Initiative, led by the Commandant General, Comr. Taju Owen Balogun, commended Obaseki for the peace and unity witnessed in the state, expressing the readiness of the group to collaborate with government to improve security.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to keep the highway safe for the people, as we will help to check the activity of criminals who hide in the forests to commit nefarious acts.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who expressed his appreciation to the group for the gesture, assured them that his administration will partner with them to keep the state safe for all.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to collaborate in the area of security, as we have made great impact in the area of keeping the state safe and peaceful,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

I am sure that when we are done, it will be one of the most viable road networks in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe scheme has been designed in such a way that it will allow for private investment on such roads.

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNigeria\u2019s state of insecurity is not a sufficient reason to stop the 2023 general elections from holding, a presidential aspirant said on Monday.\n\nKingsley Moghalu, an ex-CBN deputy governor and the 2019 presidential candidate for Young Progressives Party (YPP), at a press conference in Abuja, said he supported President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s insistence to hold the 2023 regardless of the troubling coordinated attacks on INEC facilities and other parts of the nation.\n\n\u201cI think we have to understand that we have a commitment to democracy, even America, during war held elections. I will not encourage the kind of thinking that allows us to seek refuge in excuses to truncate democracy all because there is a lot of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cEven the president, Buhari himself, has said, in his recent remark, that was the more controversial comment, that elections must hold in 2023 and I believe that it is a good position, and I think that is the position we should all take,\u201d Mr Moghalu said .\n\nBefore his recent meeting with Mr Buhari, the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, had subtly spoken about the possibility of not holding the 2023 elections due to the constant attacks on its facilities by unknown gunmen.\n\nThe attacks, best described as an offshoot of the current state of the country, have led to the destruction of 42 of the commission\u2019s facilities housing both sensitive and non-sensitive election materials and other properties.\n\nMr Moghalu presented five recommendations to the current administration to kickstart and forge a united path for Nigerians.\n\nKey recommendations\n\nHe suggested the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission.\n\nAccording to him, the commission should comprise seven independent members \u201cone from each geopolitical zone, and one international member assigned from the United Nations or from South Africa, both entities of which have extensive experience in TRC matters, with a six month mandate to examine specifically the events of January 1966 to January 1970, invite witnesses, survivors and critical players still alive to make statements, and make findings and recommendations that will promote national reconciliation by turning historical memory into a positive force for mutual forgiveness and nation building.\u201d\n\nThe ex-CBN chief called on Mr Buhari to invite secessionist agitation movements to a national dialogue with the goal to address verifiable grievances and set up a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution for the country.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari should appoint a panel of historians, with equal representation from the northern and southern parts of Nigeria to review and agree on a curriculum of contemporary national history, including the Nigerian Civil War, to be taught in primary and secondary institutions from the specific perspective of lessons learned, national healing and reconciliation;\n\n\u201cEstablish May 30 as a national holiday to remember the millions that died in the Nigerian civil war,\u201d he further recommended.\n\nIn addition to this, Mr Moghalu spoke about the need to localise the country\u2019s policing and embark on constant training for officers to enhance professionalism in the force.\n\nHe acknowledged the role of separationist groups in the cases of attacks in the southern parts of the country but factored in the possibility of politicians using the region to fight their political battles in the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cI can see a lot of political motives in all of the insecurity in the country, in some cases it is just sheer criminality. We know that there are some separationists who have accepted responsibilities for the insecurity in the country. There is a mixture of things.\n\n\u201cThere is another theory that the violence in the region is to discredit the region in the coming election,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Moghalu has declared to run for Nigeria topmost seat in the coming election, but he is yet to declare the party on whose platform he would do so.",

Ayobami Afolabi and Hon. Akinola Olasunkanmi Omotuntun, secretary, also pledged unflinching support for the chairman of the party in the state, Prince Gboyega Famodun.\n\nThe group frowned at the \u201cpurported splinter group\u201d in the party known as \u201cThe Osun Progressives\u201d, saying the motive behind the group was to distract Governor Oyetola.\n\nThe communique reads this: \u201cThat the incumbent Governor, His Excellency, Mr. Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola and His loyal Deputy Governor, His Excellency, Benedict Olugboyega Alabi should continue with their second term in office.\n\n\u201cThat Prince Adegboyega Famoodun to continue his good job as chairman of our great party APC in the state of Osun\n\n\u201cAlso, we want to reemphasize that we, the APC members in the federal constituency of Irewole, Isokan and Ayedaade dissociate ourselves from membership of destructive splinter group in APC called TOP.

This should stop,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cOur association also roundly condemns the attendant indiscriminate killing of innocent persons in the guise of going after the arsonists and destroyers of public facilities in the area.\n\n\u201cThe situation in Owerri where security agents indiscriminately go after mass arrests of youths in churches and their families is unacceptable to IZUNWANNE and should stop forthwith.\n\n\u201cIZUNWANNE pleads with President Muhammadu Buhari to cool his temper as the father of the country and review his \u201cshoot at sight\u201d order to stop security operatives from taking advantage of the order to engage in indiscriminate shootings and mowing down of the lives of many vulnerable, helpless and innocent people in both southeast and Southsouth zones of the country, as is currently the case in the two zones. Such approach can never bring peace but would rather compound issues, lead to intimidation, suppression and coercion. There are better other possible and legal ways available to government to responsibly bring about peace and tranquility in the zones than the present path which the security forces are taking.\n\n\u201cWe support a UNITED Nigeria, where equity, justice and fair play are the principles that should govern the co-existence of all peoples of the country.\n\n\u201cNo organisation linked with violence should be linked with Ndi Igbo as a people. Ndigbo are not in support of any group of persons who have taken to violence under whatever name or guise.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo are peace loving enterprising people who live everywhere in Nigeria and have investments there and will never as a people support or resort to using violence as a means of settling issues with anyone. Wherever they are found outside their homelands they always live in peace with their hosts.\n\n\u201cAs a people, Ndigbo do not support the killing of security forces and burning of public and private properties by unknown gunmen on one hand and the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians by enraged security personnel on the other hand hand, in the Southeast geo-political zone.\n\n\u201cWe call for refrain from engaging in such atrocities by the parties involved.\u201d",

J. Nwankwo attempted to smear the Zenith Bank brand and the personality of the deputy managing director, Ms. Ada Umeoji.\n\nShe said in the poorly executed job, Zenith bank, the overall best bank in Nigeria, was targeted for smear.\n\nShe further explained that Zenith Bank did not get to where it is today without excellence corporate governance and adoption of international best practices in all its affairs.\n\nAkpeh added that members of the management team of the bank are not mediocre to flout the rules as alleged by the hireling that the bank was using depositors\u2019 money for politics.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is disheartening that the author of the piece wrote for Mr. Soludo, himself a former Governor of the Central Bank and who should have known that it was not possible for just one officer in a bank to get access to depositors\u2019 funds and use same for politics or was that a possibility in the days of Mr. Soludo as CBN Governor?\n\n\u201cWe respectfully call on Mr. Soludo and his political Godfather, Chinedu Obidigwe to know that smear campaigns against fellow aspirants in the same party cannot help him or the Party to win elections.\n\n\u201cZenith Bank is an international brand and one ill-bred political hireling cannot bring it down.

Infrastructures, agriculture and so many other plans. I have modified those plans now from what they were before. Anambra will be a different state once I am elected as the governor,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue of concensus candidate, the Senator said: \u201cI dont think that has been presented to us. I have no idea what you are saying. Nobody told me about concensus. I have not heard it. This is the first time I am hearing it from you.\n\nAbout other contestants like the former CBN Governor Charles Soludo and how he will be able to scuffle through with the incumbent Governor, Willy Obiano, he said; \u201cWell, for you mentioning Soludo, I think Anambra people will have to decide after our primary and I know i am going to win for sure.\n\n\u201cAfter the primary they will decide who they want as their governor. What APGA has done they have done. Everybody knows.They have been there for 16 years and that doesn\u2019t mean; if you remember, we had a party that was there for many years.\n\n\u201cAPC still came in. So many years doesn\u2019t mean anything. That you are there for twenty or thirty years. What have you done? Are the people happy with you? If they are not then you have reasons to change, I am sure there will be change to vote APC this time, he stated.\n\nOn his part, Rev Godwin Okonkwo, another contestant while submitting his forms said he is in the contest, fully prepared with sound mind, capacity, courage and character.\n\nHe noted that competence without character has no value; \u201cThey both enrich values. And I think I have that.\n\n\u201cI am bringing unity to my people. I will be a father to everyone. And Anambra with me there, hope of the poor will be restored. We will restore Anambra to a place that investors will have confidence and a place to invest in.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of zoning, Rev Okonkwo who emphasised on fairness said: \u201cI believe in fairness, equity, justice, and good conscience.\n\n\u201cIf the North had gone, equity demands that it comes to the south. If it doesn\u2019t go to the south, it means it has to wait for another 24 years before it comes to it. How old will I be by then? So it should go to South because I believe in natural justice and fairness.\u201d\n\nOn the Church participation in npolitics, the aspirant stressed that it\u2019s unfortunate what \u201cI met on ground when I joined the APC.\n\n\u201cIt shows the church still have a long way to go in impacting love in the hearts of people. When our hears are transformed, our love will not know colour. It will know no boundaries. I am an Anglican priest. When the sun shines, does it select where to shine on? Of course no.\n\n\u201cHe who hates his sister or brother is a murderer. The bible say that and I believe very much in it. I cannot go against what I preach. I will be father to all. I will respect our elders. I will honor our fathers in the lord and traditional rulers. But, I will obey God. And I know God is a just God.\n\n\u201cI will fear Him, because his love doesn\u2019t demarcate. That is who I am and what i will bring to the table.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the mode of primary election, he wants the party to choose a model that will make people in Anambra come into the APC.\n\nThe trained chartered accountant, Reverened Priest of the Angican Communion turned politican, worked in NNPC upto the level of Managing Director noted that he offered himself to serve his people, Anambra State, adding that he will not join people who publishes what they do to help others.",

          "title": "Reconsider your decision on twitter suspension, NESG urges FG",
          "text": "By PHILIP CLEMENT\n\nThe Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has called on the federal government to consider the economic implications of the recent suspension of twitter usage in Nigeria as many business rely on the social media platform to sell and trade their products.\n\nIn a statement, the NESG said:\u201dFor many of these businesses, social media platforms have become a veritable tool for engaging existing and potential clients over the years. As a result, platforms like Twitter which has about 17 million active users in Nigeria, have become a community for businesses and clients to exchange ideas, share progress, and address complaints towards optimal service delivery.\n\n\u201cLikewise, the digital marketing and e-commerce space has unveiled new markets for many Nigerian companies, particularly among the youth, many of whom have an active online presence. The contribution of these companies to job creation, value addition and the economy has been salutary.\n\n\u201cDespite the inflow of investment into the digital economy, overall Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow into Nigeria is yet to achieve its true potential. In the last five years, FDI inflows into Nigeria has remained around US$1billion, according to data from the NBS.\n\n\u201cThis amount is meagre compared with the inflows of countries such as Egypt, South Africa, and Indonesia. At a difficult time like this, when Nigeria must grow its economy, plug into the global digital revolution, attract patient international capital and sustained foreign currency inflow to address our foreign exchange challenges, the temporary suspension of Twitter in Nigeria sends out a wrong signal and will stand in the way of our path to rapid economic recovery,\u201d the NESG added.\n\nIt urged the Federal Government to reconsider the twitter ban decision and rescind the suspension to foster inclusive development, global competitiveness, and much faster economic growth in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further, the group has advised government at all levels and the private sector to explore all means of embracing and supporting the digital economy as it remains a veritable tool to national development.\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria slipped into its second recession in five years, with a GDP contraction of 3.6% in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nUnemployment rate rose to 33.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020, about 8.6 million Nigerians were estimated to have fallen into poverty in 2020, and about 13 million children were out of school.\n\nDespite its negative impact, COVID-19 has accelerated the embrace of digital technologies in our everyday lives.\n\n\u201cAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (despite the contraction of our economy), ICT and Finance emerged as two of the few growth sectors in 2020 and were the fastest-growing, with growth rates of 12.9% and 9.4%, respectively. This means that the digital sector remains crucial in accelerating Nigeria\u2019s recovery from the devastating impacts of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, Nigerian startups have raised approximately US$498 million, according to Techpoint Africa.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, in the FINTECH industry, Nigeria remains one of the most attractive markets in the African continent, attracting US$122 million in 2019, representing 24.8% of total investment in the continent, according to the 2019 African Tech Startups Funding Report. The industry has seen the entrants of companies and the rise of digital entrepreneurs who have continuously created value for brands, clients and other stakeholders,\u201d the statement added.",
          "summary": "By PHILIP CLEMENTThe Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has called on the federal government to consider the economic implications of the recent suspension of twitter usage in Nigeria as many business rely on the social media platform to sell and trade their products.\n\u201cDespite the inflow of investment into the digital economy, overall Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow into Nigeria is yet to achieve its true potential.\nIt urged the Federal Government to reconsider the twitter ban decision and rescind the suspension to foster inclusive development, global competitiveness, and much faster economic growth in Nigeria.\nIn 2020, Nigeria slipped into its second recession in five years, with a GDP contraction of 3.6% in the third quarter of 2020.\nThis means that the digital sector remains crucial in accelerating Nigeria\u2019s recovery from the devastating impacts of the pandemic.",

          "text": "A 35-year-old woman, Oluwadamilare Aremu, has accused the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital of negligence leading to the amputation of her right leg.\n\nAremu told PUNCH Metro that she was admitted to LASUTH in December 2018 when an 18-passenger vehicle she boarded was involved in a crash on the Third Mainland Bridge, leading to her suffering a broken thighbone.\n\nShe alleged that doctors at LASUTH assured her that she would walk again, but her hope was dashed after two surgeries with the doctors still demanding funds for a third and final surgery, which they claimed would solve the problem.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was discharged on July 8, 2019, to go and find the money for the third surgery, adding that she was already broke as a result of the bills she had to pay while on admission.\n\nAremu stated, \u201cI was involved in an accident and rushed to LASUTH on December 16, 2018. LASUTH doctors told me that I would walk again. But after two surgeries in 2019, I was told that I needed a third and last one. They sent me home to find money, but I was broke because I had spent over N4m while on admission.\n\n\u201cThey assured me that after the third surgery, I would be able to walk again. A social media blog, Gistlover, helped me crowdfund over N1m for the last surgery. I got the money in a week and returned to the hospital for the last surgery.\u201d\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was readmitted to the Ortho \u2018A\u2019 ward of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu orthopaedic section of the hospital, adding that despite having severe pain, LASUTH allegedly kept postponing the surgery.\n\nShe also alleged that she was later moved to the Ortho \u2018B\u2019 ward under the supervision of one Dr Kayode, who was to conduct the third surgery. But no surgery was performed from 2019 till 2020.\n\nAremu said she sought alternative medical help at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, in October 2020, adding that she was advised that the leg would have to be amputated.\n\n\u201cLASUTH readmitted me and kept postponing my surgery from 2019 till October 2020 on COVID-19 excuses. I took a COVID-19 test and it was negative. I was still passing through a lot of pain. I went to Igbobi because LASUTH stopped attending to me. Igbobi told me that amputation was the only solution left because my leg had been mismanaged. But I would have to wait till 2021 because of the queue for amputation surgery. LASUTH didn\u2019t tell me the truth from the outset,\u201d Aremu lamented.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she attempted to poison herself when the pain became unbearable, adding that she opted to amputate the leg at the Oak Hospital, Ikeja.\n\nShe also alleged that one of her doctors at LASUTH was a consultant at Oak Hospital.\n\nShe stated, \u201cI opted to have the leg amputated at Oak Hospital, Ikeja. The pain was so much that I once tried to commit suicide. Oak Hospital couldn\u2019t remove the iron that LASUTH inserted in my leg, so they called a consultant to come. It was Dr Afariogun of LASUTH, who came.\n\n\u201cHe was surprised to see me. Afariogun told me that he couldn\u2019t tell me the truth, because he was afraid of his seniors at LASUTH. Dr Soga, Dr Afariogun and Dr Ajiboye were the three doctors, who attended to me at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe victim told our correspondent that she was still in pain despite the amputation of the leg and lamented that LASUTH wasted her money and rendered her immobile.\n\n\u201cEven after the amputation surgery, the damage LASUTH did to my leg could not be undone. My left leg is weak and I keep falling each time I try to stand. I have to walk with a frame. LASUTH wasted my money and still damaged my leg. I want justice and proper compensation.\u201d\n\nWhen PUNCH Metro contacted the Chief Medical Director of LASUTH, Prof Tokunbo Fabanwo, he said investigation into the case had begun.\n\n\u201cWe are already investigating it. Give us till Thursday. The Director of Clinical Services is going to find out what happened. I will get back to you on Thursday,\u201d he said.

You can easily identify why we are experiencing developmental challenges across the board.

          "text": "The controversy over the Twitter ban by the Nigerian government took another turn Tuesday as the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians filed a lawsuit against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\nThe suit, they said, was to challenge \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter, and the escalating repression of human rights, particularly the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nFollowing the deletion of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed last week announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nSimilarly, the federal government also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) directed all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nThe suit\n\nBut challenging the action in a suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP and the concerned Nigerians sought \u201can order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nFiled by SERAP solicitor, Mr Femi Falana, the plaintiffs argued that \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia,\u201d the suit read in part.\n\nThe plaintiffs therefore asked the ECOWAS Court of Justice for the following reliefs: \u201cA DECLARATION that the action of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and micro-blogging application without an order of a competent court of jurisdiction is unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendant in mandating its agent to commence and continue to regulate the social media in Nigeria amounts to restriction and censorship, thus violating Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and micro-blogging application in Nigeria without any offence known to law is incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations, and are therefore null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the directive by the Defendant, through the National Broadcasting Commission, directing and \u2018advising\u2019 broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and discontinue its use is a breach of the citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression, access to information as well as media freedom, and therefore, null and void.\n\n\u201cA DECLARATION that the act of the Defendant to frequently threaten Nigerians and other people who use Twitter and/or other social micro-blogging applications in Nigeria with criminal prosecution and the actual act of suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, violates the principle that there is no punishment without law, and the right to fair hearing, and therefore, null and void.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER setting aside the suspension, ban, sanction or other punishments whatsoever imposed on Twitter, Nigerians, media houses, broadcast stations and any social media service providers by the Defendant and its agents.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER directing the Defendant and its agents to immediately revoke, withdraw and/or rescind their suspension or ban of Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s) in Nigeria in line with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Revised ECOWAS Treaty 1993.\n\n\u201cAN ORDER OF PERPETUAL INJUNCTION restraining the Defendant and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions and other punishment including criminal prosecution or doing anything whatsoever to harass Twitter, broadcast stations, Nigerians and other people and any social media service provider(s), and media houses who are Twitter users.\n\n\u201cSUCH FURTHER orders the Honourable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this suit.\u201d\n\nReps investigate\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives has said it would, within 10 days, investigate the reasons behind decisions by the federal government to ban Twitter.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila stated this in his opening address at the plenary Tuesday, noted that the micro-blogging platform had become a huge communication tool and platform for enterprise especially for the teeming youth in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila also said the lawmakers were inundated with protests and demands for intervention by the parliament.\n\nHe, however, noted that the House also needed to hear from the government, especially the information and culture minister who issued the directive suspending the social media app in the country.\n\nGbajabiamila, therefore, mandated the relevant committees of the House to invite Mohammed to explain the decision by the government and the reasons and basis for it.\n\nThe committees, which he ordered to start work immediately, is expected to report back within 10 days.\n\nMalami holds the ace \u2013 Mohammed\n\nAnd even at that, the information minister has said Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, SAN, will decide whether or not to prosecute the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye; Founder and General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry Worldwide, Pastor William Kumuyi; as well as other violators of the Twitter ban by the federal government.\n\nMohammed said this Monday evening during an interview with BBC News Africa.\n\nAdeboye, in a tweet Monday, had said his church is present in over 170 countries and tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nAlso, hours later, Kumuyi also tweeted that his church had branches across over 100 countries and five continents hence it can tweet from anywhere in the world.\n\nAsked specifically whether the government would prosecute Kumuyi and Adeboye for defying its Twitter ban, the minister said: \u201cThe Attorney-General has made it clear that if anybody violates the regulation that such a person will be prosecuted and this is not about any particular person. It is in the realm of the Attorney-General to decide who or who not to prosecute.\u201d",
          "summary": "The controversy over the Twitter ban by the Nigerian government took another turn Tuesday as the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians filed a lawsuit against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\u201cAN ORDER setting aside the suspension, ban, sanction or other punishments whatsoever imposed on Twitter, Nigerians, media houses, broadcast stations and any social media service providers by the Defendant and its agents.\nHe, however, noted that the House also needed to hear from the government, especially the information and culture minister who issued the directive suspending the social media app in the country.\nAdeboye, in a tweet Monday, had said his church is present in over 170 countries and tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",

          "title": "Why EFCC is after me \u2013 Nwoko, Ex A\u2019Ibom AG -NigPilot",
          "text": "A former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Akwa Ibom, Uwemedimo Nwoko (SAN) has said that his current travails with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) may not be unconnected with his role against the anti-graft agency probing the government of former Governor Godswill Akpabio.\n\nNwoko who was quizzed by the EFCC recently over his role in various financial transactions of both the former and current administrations in the state spoke on a live radio programme in Uyo yesterday\n\nThe former AG who praised the EFCC for being civil, respectful and professional throughout the five days period of interrogation however expressed suspicion that the claims made against him by the agency could just be cover for the intention of punishing him for being the first lawyer to challenge the right of a federal agency to probe the activities of a state government in a federal state.\n\n\u201cLet me say this. When I came into office, EFCC was harassing the former governor, His Excellency, Senator Godswill Akpabio and trying to probe into the activities of the state government in the past, (before Udom Emmanuel).\n\n\u201cSo as a constitutional lawyer, I demanded to know the basis the EFCC as a federal agency was drawing it\u2019s powers from to come and query the way the state government was spending money from, in a federal republic like Nigeria. And I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the answer they gave me so I went to court.\n\n\u201cWe filed the very first suit of that nature in the whole country. I filed that suit in February 2017 and we were doing that matter all along. So because of that matter, we got an injunction stopping the EFCC from interfering with the transactions of the Akwa Ibom State government. Not the transactions of the days of governor Udom Emmanuel, transactions that happened before he came into government.\n\n\u201cWhen we got the injunction, the EFCC wasn\u2019t happy with me because they said such a thing has not happened before in the country, that I\u2019m the only person that came to do it and I told them that I swore to uphold the constitution and what I\u2019m taking to court for interpretation is the same constitution I swore to uphold.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to do is to send your lawyers to court to come and argue that matter. If they win, they win, if I win, I win. So because of the injunction, they couldn\u2019t access Akwa Ibom State. They couldn\u2019t make any serious incursion into the state. I think that was one of the reasons they were waiting for me. So, I also knew that when I left the government, that they would come for me. That\u2019s why I said I was expecting them and kept all my records very straight.\u201d He explained.\n\nHe explained that the N65 million out of N1.3B transferred to his account by a former NBA chairman, Mr Paul Usoro(SAN) that the EFCC said was a kickback was meant to pay lawyers of Akwa Ibom State extraction which he was under obligation to coordinate as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice adding that they were e-transfers and were verifiable.\n\n\u201cEFCC should have asked the circumstances under which Paul Usoro, SAN transferred 65 million naira to my account. As at the time 1.3 billion naira was paid to Paul Usoro, SAN, we were equally running 37 election tribunal matters, running four tribunals that were relocated from Uyo to Abuja.\n\n\u201cPaul Usoro was coordinating the entire legal team. Amongst the legal team were local lawyers, local lawyers in the sense of Akwa Ibom based lawyers and Paul Usoro was handling the Senior Advocates and the other lawyers from outside the state.\n\n\u201cHe mandated me as Attorney General to coordinate the home based lawyers. So the N65M was for the lawyers I coordinated. Good enough, it was not something that was hidden.\n\n\u201cThe statement of account which they already had in their file from Zenith Bank reflected that the money was transferred to my account on the 27th, August 2015, on the 28th, I started paying out the monies and good enough, they were all transfers, so they have it in their own record.\u201d He explained.\n\nNwoko dismissed the second allegation that he used funds from the Akwa Ibom State government through the Ministry of Justice to pay for the legal fees of Governor Emmanuel during the post election litigation challenging the victory of the PDP in the 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been because the legal fees of His Excellency, the governor, were paid totally from the party (PDP) coordinated arrangement. No one naira of Akwa Ibom State money was used to pay the legal bills of the governor. Not one naira and I told the EFCC that.\u201d The former AG said.\n\nHe added that he expected his arrest long before it came because, \u201cit was one of the things I expected. I expect that when I leave office, that I will be taken to anywhere in Nigeria, that I will be questioned, that I will be asked to make statements and clarifications\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have been in the kind of office that I occupied, did the things I did, stepped on the toes I stepped on and you didn\u2019t anticipate that when you come out, that this kind of thing will happen. Possibly, it may not be the last time. Those things are expected\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut I am ready for anything. If I\u2019m going to be charged to court, I\u2019ve made my statement. My belief is that when they read through my statement they need any further documents which are already available to them.\n\n\u201cThey have a team of lawyers to look at the documents and determine whether given what I have said, there is a valid case in court to pursue. If they don\u2019t have a case, they will also advise themselves properly.\u201d",

          "text": "The African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) has officially unveiled the \u201cCentre LSD Build Grant,\u201d to bridge the unacceptable gender imbalance in the extractive industry in the country.\n\nThe Centre said the Build Grant is for general support for strengthening an intersectional approach to gender and natural resources management, and a project for institutional strengthening.\n\nThe Programme Coordinator, Centre LSD, Ms. Victoria Udoh said this while unveiling the Grant in a press conference in Abuja.\n\nShe said that the Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives.\n\nShe added that the result of the above scenario is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\nMs. Victoria explained that the overarching goal of the project is to build strong and resilient organizations that will contribute to elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\nShe said that the project which is supported by Ford Foundation is divided into two fold, \u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions\u201d and \u201cProgrammatic Interventions\u201d.\n\n\u201cInstitutional Strengthening Interventions seeks to build the capacity of staff to deliver on the BUILD grant and beyond. It is also designed to strengthen the systems and structures of the Centre through the procurement of ancillary resources needed to interrogate systems, structures and practices that have put women and children in disadvantage in the extractive sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile Programmatic Interventions is dedicated to the implementation of activities geared towards reducing the barriers faced by women in the extractive industry. During the project lifespan, activities and programmes to reverse the identified practices and barriers faced by women in the extractive sector will be our focus\u201d.\n\nGiving insight into factor that attracted the grant to the centre, Ms. Victoria said: \u201cIn Nigeria, women faces systematic discrimination in all phases of extractive industry. The entrenched gender bias not only prevents women from engaging in and accessing economic benefits, but also manifests in how companies and governments engage with communities at all stages of extractive activities. The Mineral and Mining Act 2007 which guides processes and procedures in the sector is gender blind and as a result, company-community consultation and decision-making are done in alienation of women and their perspectives. The result is increasing gender inequality and further disempowerment of women.\n\n\u201cThe African Centre for Leadership Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) in sync with the government\u2019s determination to reform the extractive industry and diversify revenue sources to include non-oil revenue, implemented the strengthening civic engagement and advocacy for effective natural resource governance in Nigeria project. The aim was to mobilize citizens to participate in the governance of natural resources for the mineral sector to contribute significantly to the Gross Domestic Product. During the implementation of this project, emphasis was not placed on the humans as well the effect on men varies from effects on women and children. For example, as land is expropriated for extractive industry projects, so are family farms that women often manage. These farms give women the ability to earn income, some level of independence and decision making power in the household and community\u201d.\n\nTo address these anomalies, she concluded that the centre is implementing a grant, still in the extractive sector, specifically looking at how to integrate gender in its extractive work.",

Yakubu Pam has warned against taking pilgrims on pilgrimage outside the country without passing through the Commission, describing such as illegal.\n\nPam who disclosed this in his office in Abuja during a courtesy visit by the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria, CTPAN, said that no pilgrim would be allowed to travel out on Christian Pilgrimage without clearance from NCPC.\n\n\u201cIt is illegal for people to travel out of the country on pilgrimage without due respect to NCPC proceedings. That act will no longer be accepted by the Commission hence forth\u201d.\n\nThe NCPC boss explained that so many Christian Pilgrimage Operators, CPOs especially through the Lagos Airport have been taking people on pilgrimage without proper licensing and clearance from the Commission, he therefore vowed that his administration would ensure that those caught in the act would be brought to book.\n\n\u201cI have come on board to make sure that there is discipline and to ensure that there is no corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Executive Secretary encouraged the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria to always stand for truth and to discourage abscondment among their pilgrims.\n\nAccording to him, the essence of pilgrimage will be defeated if they are more concerned about their personal gain.\n\nHe intimated that the Commission would give the Christian Pilgrimage Operators one year renewal waiver of their license since pilgrimage exercise had been on hold for over one year due to COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nPam further charged the Association to ensure that the composition of their executive members should reflect national interest and not just from one geo-political zone of the country.\n\nEarlier, the President of the Christian Tourism Practitioners Association of Nigeria, Rev. Dr. Israel Kristilere thanked the Executive Secretary for receiving them despite his busy schedule.\n\nHe informed the NCPC boss that they were in NCPC to rub minds and seek his support on some of the issues the Association was passing through.\n\nIn his words \u201cwe want NCPC to carry us along on issues as it concerns pilgrimage\u201d.\n\nHe stated that due to COVID 19 pandemic, pilgrimage exercise has not been done for over a year and that NCPC should grant their members a one year renewal waiver of their license.\n\nThe Newly elected executive members of CPTAN were led by the former Chairman, Mrs. Adeola Adekola and other brand new executive members.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians have dragged the Federal Government to the ECOWAS court over the unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nIn the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed on Tuesday before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, SERAP and the concerned Nigerians are seeking: \u201can order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nFollowing the deletion of a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed last week announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe government has also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has asked all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nIn the suit filed by Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana SAN, the Plaintiffs contend that \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia.\n\nSERAP and the concerned Nigerians are therefore asking the ECOWAS Court of Justice for the following reliefs:\n\nA declaration that the action of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and microblogging application without an order of a competent court of jurisdiction is unlawful, inconsistent and incompatible with Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendant in mandating its agent to commence and continue to regulate the social media in Nigeria amounts to restriction and censorship, thus violating Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nA declaration that the act of the Defendant and its agents in suspending the operation of Twitter or any other social media and microblogging application in Nigeria without any offence known to law is incompatible with Nigeria\u2019s international human rights obligations, and are therefore null and void to the extent of their inconsistency and incompatibility.\n\nA declaration that the directive by the Defendant, through the National Broadcasting Commission, directing and \u2018advising\u2019 broadcast stations to deactivate their Twitter accounts and discontinue its use is a breach of the citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression, access to information as well as media freedom, and therefore, null and void.\n\nA declaration that the act of the defendant to frequently threaten Nigerians and other people who use Twitter and/or other social microblogging applications in Nigeria with criminal prosecution and the actual act of suspending the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, violates the principle that there is no punishment without law, and the right to fair hearing, and therefore, null and void.\n\nAn order setting aside the suspension, ban, sanction or other punishments whatsoever imposed on Twitter, Nigerians, media houses, broadcast stations and any social media service providers by the Defendant and its agents.\n\nAn order directing the Defendant and its agents to immediately revoke, withdraw and/or rescind their suspension or ban of Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s) in Nigeria in line with Nigeria\u2019s obligations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Revised ECOWAS Treaty 1993.\n\nAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendant and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions and other punishment including criminal prosecution or doing anything whatsoever to harass Twitter, broadcast stations, Nigerians and other people and any social media service provider(s), and media houses who are Twitter users.\n\nSuch further orders the Honorable Court may deem fit to make in the circumstances of this suit.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the interim application and the substantive suit.",

After having decided to ignore the ruling of the ECOWAS Court of Justice obliging it to release Alex Saab, Cabo Verde is now being called to order by the United Nations. No State respecting international law and the rule of law could legitimately ignore this new call to reason and to respect human rights.\n\nFor the record: The Committee\u2019s \u201cconsistent position\u201d is \u201cthat a failure to implement interim measures is incompatible with the obligation to respect in good faith the procedure for the consideration of individual communications under the Optional Protocol. The Committee reminded the State party that the obligations under the Covenant and the Optional Protocol are binding on the State party as a whole, including all branches of its Government.\u201d The State of Cabo Verde has been a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since August 6, 1993 and to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since May 19, 2000.

          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron was slapped in the face Tuesday by a man during a visit to a small town in southeastern France, an incident that prompted a wide show of support for the head of state from politicians across the ideological spectrum.\n\nThe French president was greeting the public waiting for him behind barriers in the town of Tain-l\u2019Hermitage after he visited a high school that is training students to work in hotels and restaurants.\n\nMacron described the incident as an \u201cisolated act,\u201d in an interview with local newspaper Le Dauphine Libere.\n\n\u201cEverything goes well \u2026 We must not let isolated acts, ultra-violent individuals, like there had been some also in (street) protests, dominate the public debate: they don\u2019t deserve it,\u201d he said.\n\nMacron said he didn\u2019t have specific concerns after the assault.\n\n\u201cI greeted the people who were by the man\u2019s side and made pictures with them. I continued and will continue. Nothing will stop me,\u201d he said.\n\nA bodyguard, who was standing right behind Macron, raised a hand in defense of the president, but was a fraction of a second too late to stop the slap. The bodyguard then put his arm around the president to protect him.\n\nMacron just managed to turn his face away as the aggressor\u2019s right hand connected, making it appear that the president took more of a glancing blow than a direct slap.\n\nThe man, who was wearing a mask, appears to have cried out \u201cMontjoie! Saint Denis!\u201d a centuries-old royalist war cry, before finishing with \u201cA bas la Macronie,\u201d or \u201cDown with Macron.\u201d\n\nAnother video showed Macron immediately coming back after the incident, seemingly to face his assailant, and then to say hello to other members of the crowd.\n\nFrench news broadcaster BFMTV said police detained two people \u2013 the man suspected of slapping Macron and another man who filmed a video.\n\nA few hours later, Macron took a 25-minute walk in the narrow streets of the nearby city of Valence, posing for selfies with a small crowd and chatting with many people in a light and warm atmosphere. Some could be heard telling Macron, \u201cThank you\u201d and \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, \u201cMontjoie! Saint Denis!\u201d was cried out by someone who threw a cream pie at far-left French lawmaker Eric Coquerel. At the time, the extreme-right, monarchist group Action Francaise took responsibility. Coquerel on Tuesday expressed his solidarity with Macron.\n\nSpeaking at the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament, Prime Minister Jean Castex said \u201cthrough the head of state, that\u2019s democracy that has been targeted.\u201d Lawmakers from across the political spectrum got to their feet and applauded loudly in a show of support.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is about debate, dialogue, confrontation of ideas, expression of legitimate disagreements, of course, but in no case can it be violence, verbal assault and even less physical assault,\u201d Castex said.\n\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen firmly condemned on Twitter \u201cthe intolerable physical aggression targeting the president of the Republic.\u201d\n\nVisibly fuming, she said later that while Macron is her top political adversary, the assault was \u201cdeeply, deeply reprehensible.\u201d\n\nFormer President Francois Hollande of the Socialist Party tweeted that the slap was an \u201cunbearable and intolerable blow against our institutions\u2026.The entire nation must show solidarity with the head of state.\u201d\n\nLess than one year before France\u2019s next presidential election, centrist Macron embarked last week on a political \u201ctour de France,\u201d saying he plans to visit French regions in the coming months to \u201cfeel the pulse of the country\u201d as the government works to revive the nation\u2019s pandemic-hit economy.\n\nMacron has said in an interview he wants to engage with people in a mass consultation with the French public aimed at \u201cturning the page\u201d of the pandemic \u2014 and preparing his possible campaign for a second term.\n\nMounting concerns about violence against elected officials and police have been aired in France, particularly after unruly members of \u201cyellow vest\u201d economic protest movement repeatedly clashed with riot-control officers in 2019.\n\nVillage mayors and lawmakers also have been targeted with physical assaults, death threats and harassment.\n\nBut France\u2019s well-protected head of state had been spared, which compounded the shockwaves that rippled through French politics in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s assault.\n\nMacron, like his predecessors, enjoys spending time in meet-and-greets with members of the public. Called \u201ccrowd baths\u201d in French, they have long been a staple of French politics and only very rarely produce shows of disrespect for the president.\n\nA bystander yanked then-President Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s suit during a crowd bath in 2011.

          "text": "Ratko Mladic, the military chief known as the \u201cButcher of Bosnia\u201d for orchestrating genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Balkan nation\u2019s 1992-95 war, lost his final legal battle Tuesday when U.N. judges rejected his appeals and affirmed his life sentence.\n\nThe ruling involving his 2017 convictions and sentence closed a grim chapter in European history that included the continent\u2019s first genocide since World War II \u2014 the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys.\n\nThe now-frail Mladic, often belligerent at his court appearances in The Hague, showed no reaction other than a scowl as Presiding Judge Prisca Matimba Nyambe of Zambia said the panel had dismissed, by a vote of 4-1, his appeals of convictions for crimes including genocide, murder, extermination and terror for atrocities throughout the war that killed more than 100,000 and left millions homeless.\n\nThe 79-year-old former general is the last major figure to face justice from the conflict that ended more than a quarter century ago.\n\nHis former political chief, ex-Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, already is serving a life sentence after being convicted for the same crimes. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who was accused of fomenting the ethnic conflicts that tore apart the Balkans in the 1990s, died in a U.N. cell in 2006 before judges at his trial could reach verdicts.\n\nSerge Brammertz, the prosecutor who finally brought both Karadzic and Mladic to justice, said Mladic \u201cranks among the most notorious war criminals in modern history\u201d who abused his position of power to commit crimes including genocide.\n\n\u201cMladic should be condemned by all responsible officials in the former Yugoslavia and around the world,\u201d Brammertz said. \u201cHis name should be consigned to the list of history\u2019s most depraved and barbarous figures.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said the \u201chistoric judgment shows that those who commit horrific crimes will be held accountable. It also reinforces our shared resolve to prevent future atrocities from occurring anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thoughts today are with all the surviving families of the many victims of Mladic\u2019s atrocities. We can never erase the tragedy of their deaths, but I hope today\u2019s judgment provides some solace to all those who are grieving,\u201d a statement from Biden said.\n\nThe court also rejected an appeal by prosecutors of Mladic\u2019s acquittal on one other count of genocide linked to ethnic purges early in the war.\n\nAs commander of the Bosnian Serb Army, the once-swaggering Mladic led troops responsible for atrocities ranging from \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d campaigns to the siege of Sarajevo and the war\u2019s bloody climax in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.\n\nIn Sarajevo, applause broke out among those watching the proceedings. Mayor Benjamina Karic called it \u201ca day of justice\u201d for Sarajevo, Bosnia and innocent victims of the war.\n\nMladic\u2019s toxic legacy continues to divide Bosnia and his dark shadow has spread far beyond the Balkans.\n\nTo Serbs in Bosnia, he is a war hero who fought to protect his people. To Bosniaks, mostly Muslims, he will always be a villain responsible for their wartime suffering and losses.\n\nNedziba Salihovic, who lost her son and husband in the bloodshed, watched the court hearing on a large screen in Srebrenica.\n\n\u201cThis means a lot to me, my heart is racing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was punished. It is not important where he\u2019ll end up (to serve his sentence). Like mothers of Srebrenica, he\u2019ll spend the rest of his life without his family.\u201d\n\nBosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik blasted the final verdict as \u201cselective justice\u201d and \u201csatanization of Serbs\u201d which will only deepen the existing ethnic divide in Bosnia so many years after the war.\n\n\u201cThe court did not prove Mladic\u2019s direct guilt,\u201d Dodik said. \u201cIt is clear that genocide in Srebrenica never happened.\u201d\n\nMladic\u2019s son, Darko, who was part of his defense team, said in The Hague: \u2019\u2019This traveling circus (the tribunal) has finished its job like it started. The general had no chance of a fair trial.\u201d\n\nMladic was first indicted in July 1995. After the war in Bosnia ended, he went into hiding and was finally arrested in 2011 and handed over to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia by the then-ruling pro-Western government of Serbia.\n\nThe judgment was welcomed as \u201can important affirmation of the rule of law\u201d by Kathryne Bomberger, director-general of the International Commission on Missing Persons that helped locate and identify victims of atrocities in Bosnia.\n\n\u201cRamifications of the judgment in case of Mladic and in previous cases, such as that of Radovan Karadzic, go beyond the Western Balkans. This gives hope to survivors of atrocity, including families of the missing and disappeared persons around the world, that justice can be delivered,\u201d Bomberger said.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s Europe Director Nils Mui\u017eniek said the ruling \u201csends a powerful message around the world that impunity cannot, and will not, be tolerated.\u201d\n\nNedzad Avdic, who survived a mass execution in Srebrenica, said he was satisfied \u201ceven though nothing can erase what we\u2019ve been through nor bring back our dead.\u201d\n\nThe judgment \u201cwill make denying the crimes more difficult. This and other verdicts will be the starting point for anyone who cares about truth,\u201d he added.\n\nThe shadow of Mladic and Karadzic has spread far beyond the Balkans. They have been revered by foreign far-right supporters for their bloody wartime campaigns.\n\nThe Australian who shot dead dozens of Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 was believed to be inspired by the wartime Bosnian Serb leaders, as was Anders Breivik, the Norwegian white supremacist who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.\n\nThe U.N. tribunal that initially indicted Mladic has since shut its doors. His appeal and other legal issues left over from the tribunal were being dealt with by the U.N.\u2019s International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, which is housed in the same building as the now-defunct court for the former Yugoslavia.\n\nOutside the court, another mother from Srebrenica, Munira Subasic had a message for young people in Serbia and the Serb part of Bosnia.\n\nShe urged them to study the court\u2019s judgments and indictments, and \u201cstop hating and create a better future for themselves and our children.\u201d",
          "summary": "Ratko Mladic, the military chief known as the \u201cButcher of Bosnia\u201d for orchestrating genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Balkan nation\u2019s 1992-95 war, lost his final legal battle Tuesday when U.N. judges rejected his appeals and affirmed his life sentence.\nHis former political chief, ex-Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic, already is serving a life sentence after being convicted for the same crimes.\nSerge Brammertz, the prosecutor who finally brought both Karadzic and Mladic to justice, said Mladic \u201cranks among the most notorious war criminals in modern history\u201d who abused his position of power to commit crimes including genocide.\nThe court also rejected an appeal by prosecutors of Mladic\u2019s acquittal on one other count of genocide linked to ethnic purges early in the war.\nOutside the court, another mother from Srebrenica, Munira Subasic had a message for young people in Serbia and the Serb part of Bosnia.",
