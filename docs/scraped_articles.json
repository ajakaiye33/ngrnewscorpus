          "title": "ASUU: Ex-minister, lecturers disagree over varsities\u2019 financial autonomy",
          "text": "A former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, and some education experts have disagreed over financial autonomy for the nation\u2019s universities.\n\nWhile Nwajiuba, in an interview with The PUNCH, stressed the need to grant public universities financial autonomy, the two experts, in separate interviews, said the government cannot absolve itself of its duty of funding education.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities have grounded academic activities in public universities for 100 days.\n\nThe strike by ASUU, which commenced on Monday, February 14, 2022, was based on some lingering demands.\n\nIn declaring the strike, the National President of ASUU, Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, blamed the government for not funding universities adequately.\n\nThe union also lamented the failure of the government to deploy the University Transparency Accountability System, a payment platform developed by the union, among others.\n\nThough the Federal Government commenced payment of minimum wage arrears it owed members of the union last week, ASUU insisted that the payment of minimum wage arrears was not one of its demands.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, Nwajiuba noted the need to allow universities to fund themselves.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is the need to have Boards of Trustees for universities. Governing Councils operate differently from Boards of Trustees.\n\n\u201cWe already have a template which if you read the University Autonomy Act; you\u2019ll find out that universities are essentially autonomous because even the council can act wholly by appointing Vice-Chancellors. They do not need approval from Abuja. They can hire and fire their lecturers. All that the government does is to pay.\n\n\u201cAnother issue is earned allowances. Now, lecturers paid by the government may, in different proportions, have done extra work. For example, supervising postgraduate students and all, they come up with some percentages for the government to pay. Now, the government does not know these people, the government did not work out these percentages.\n\n\u201cLooking at some of these issues, you will realise that it is time to grant universities full financial autonomy so that all of these things that are contentious and repeated will stop being problems and will be treated locally. All universities do not have uniform problems.\n\nExperts fault call for financial autonomy for varsities\n\nWhen our correspondent reached out to Osodeke on the issue of financial autonomy for the universities, he said, \u201cYou know our position on the matter. Our position remains the same.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had reported how Osodeke, in an earlier, interview noted that it was the sole responsibility of the government to fund the university education in the country.\n\n\u201cThe children of the poor suffer here in Nigerian universities while their children get quality education outside the country, graduate and come back here to take the juicy jobs, and keep lording it over children from poor backgrounds. It\u2019s a class issue. For us, the option is for them; its either they shut down all the universities and let all the children go and learn mechanics or they fund the universities.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Professor of Plant Biology and Biotechnology at the Adekunle Ajasin University Akungba, Olumekun Victor, the government cannot absolve itself of its duty of funding education.\n\nOlumekun, who is also a founding member of the ASUU, AAUA chapter, noted that the proposed plan would lead to increase in the fees of universities.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that\u2019s the plan of the present crop of leaders but what does this say for the educational system? What then is the business of the government? Universities only need to jerk up school fees but what does that say for the underprivileged?\n\n\u201cEducation is an essential ingredient for national development; hence the government needs to substantially invest in it. However, universities can then look out for other sources to complement\n\nCorroborating Olumekun\u2019s point of view, the chairman of ASUU, Federal University of Technology Minna, Dr. Gbolahan Bolarin, told our correspondent that such plan would make the government shy away from its responsibilities.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis plan is just going to make the government shy away from its responsibilities. It is the duty of the government to fund universities. You cannot just say you want the universities to source for funds. How will they source the funds? Will it be by increasing school fees? What happens to the students? How will they pay?\n\n\u201cI think the government is not ready to do the needful. We are not at the point where you can say that the government should not fund universities. It cannot work. It will lead to a high level of illiteracy as people won\u2019t be able to access university education.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "INEC boss, others decry money politics during primaries",
          "text": "Stakeholders, on Wednesday, expressed fears over the manner politicians have monetised the nation\u2019s electoral process, describing it as a dangerous trend.\n\nThe stakeholders, including the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, and his predecessor, Prof. Attahiru Jega, raised the concerns during a one-day colloquium with the theme, \u201cEmerging issues that will shape the 2023 general elections in Nigeria\u201d, organised by the Centre for Democracy and Development and Open Society Initiative for West Africa.\n\nAt the event, Jega warned INEC against altering the timetable for the 2023 elections, including shifting the deadline for primaries.\n\nYakubu said politicians using money to sway delegates to their sides during their primaries, the increasing insecurity across the country, and the menace of fake news had become matters of concern to INEC.\n\nHe, however, assured stakeholders that INEC would work with anti-graft agencies to reverse the trend.\n\nYakubu said, \u201cNigeria is moving towards Plutocracy. But there are two dimensions to it. It becomes much more difficult to control the situation when you have willing collectors. We have seen cases where voters reject money and vote for their choice, like what happened in Anambra. Also, there are situations where voters go after the vote buyers on election day.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is now going beyond simply the question of buying votes at polling units. What political parties do is critical to what INEC does. INEC conducts secondary elections, but it is the candidates who participate in the secondary elections.\n\n\u201cThe way money exchanges hands is a source of concern. However, we have renewed our partnership with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission on this aspect\u201d.\n\nHe said that the commission has finalised the regulations and guidelines for the 2023 general elections, adding that \u201cabout 430 million ballot papers would be printed for the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nJega said although there have been increasingly positive changes in INEC over the years, the political class has made many efforts to undermine the integrity of elections.\n\nWhile commending INEC for refusing to yield to the pressure of political parties to change the timetable for elections, Jega said the timetable was set under a process of careful contemplation and in the context of the new electoral law.\n\nHe said shifting the timetable is a recipe for electoral disaster \u201cbecause it affects virtually all the others once you shift one timeframe.\u201d\n\nHe berated the National Assembly for increasing the threshold of campaign finance by political parties.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Senior Fellow, CDD, Prof. Jibrin Ibrahim, decried what he termed the \u201cextensive growth of banditry within the political class.\u201d\n\nHe said elections in the country would always become a complicated issue when a significant percentage of the political class are crooks and criminals.\n\nIbrahim maintained that the open partisanship of Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, was sufficient enough to mar the credibility of the 2023 elections.\n\nHowever, the National Chairman, Inter-Party Advisory Council, Yabagi Sani, defended the cost of nomination fees collected by parties, adding that parties need funds to print posters, pay staff members and organise campaigns.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "CIAN\u2019s book prepares Nigerians ahead of 2023 election",
          "text": "\u2026rewards essay competition winners with millions\n\nBy Prisca Sam-Duru\n\nIt was for the love and survival of Nigeria that Citizens Intervention and Accountability Network, CIAN, released its empowerment resource materials to get Nigerians prepared ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nOne of the resource materials is a National Civic Project, titled, \u2018Nigeria\u2019s Next President\u2019, a book recently presented to the general public in Abuja.\n\nThe book according to CIAN, was produced to cause a paradigm shift in the direction of Nigerian voting public by fostering civic eternal vigilance, inspiring civic responsibilities, and stirring civic activism that challenges conventions as well as demand accountability from elected officials.\n\nThe organisation is of the view that the best way to achieve the desired participatory change in the polity is for Nigerians to see themselves first as critical partners in reordering the faulty leadership recruitment process.\n\nIn a keynote address presented during the book presentation, CIAN\u2019s Director of Information and Strategy, Dr. Candyfidel Onwuraokoye, said, \u201cEurope and other nations of the world we love to make reference to, or enviably talked about and currently rushing to migrate to, did not emerge on mere hope and passivity, but on visionary and constant struggles, with people standing up to fight for their rights\u201d, adding that, Nigerian electorate must assume responsibilities in their quest for good governance by transforming to be the change they want to see.\n\nSaid he, \u201cFor too long, we have yearned for a better tomorrow, better country and mourned a better yesterday, hoping that one day things will change and get better. But rather, we are being confronted with new woes that demand Nigerians in their collective effort to rise up and do something.\n\n\u201cEnough of compromising the voting power for ephemeral economic gains popularly called \u2018stomach infrastructure\u2019. \u201cNigerians must believe in themselves, believe in their sovereign voting power, and trust the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe must not continue to cast aspersion on the electoral process, and with the negative mindset that election will be rigged and greeted with malpractices.\u201d\n\nDr. Candyfidel however indicated that, the empowerment resource materials are not intended to criticize any political party, politician, past or present leadership, but to reveal and draw attention to the basis for voting, issues to look out for, and the expectations of \u2018Nigerians from a potential \u201cNigeria Next President\u201d.\n\nThe Father of the Day, former Governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife described the book, \u2019Nigeria\u2019s next President\u2019 as timely, because Nigeria\u2019s president is the hottest issue in Nigeria today.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe problem we have is that God loves Nigeria greatly but man is messing up the country. We must pray for God to intervene in the affairs of Nigeria for the country to brace up. Politicians have lost conscience. I am one of the politicians, they have no place for fairness, no place for justice, no place for equity and you know with that kind of a thing you cannot have a good country\u201d.\n\nIn her words, CIAN\u2019s Asst. Director, Information & Strategy, Rev. Anthonia Omonze, hinted that \u201cthe empowerment resource material will take a two-pronged approach; its translation into 5 different local languages, namely Efik, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba, and Pidgin English, in order to galvanize the unlettered people who, constitute majority of the voting public; and its conversion into audio format of 5 indigenous local languages to spur the interest of those who have dominant inclination toward listening than reading among the unschooled\u201d.\n\nHighlight of the occasion was the presentation of cash award to student advocates shortlisted from a Presidential Advocacy Essay, organized for all secondary schools in Nigeria. The first, second and third positions received N1million, N700,000, and N500,000 respectively.",

          "text": ".\n\nDear Esteemed PDP Delegates\n\nI humbly write to you to draw your attention to something that will spare us further agonies of misgovernance as the elections draw close.\n\nAhead of our country\u2019s general election, we all observed the soaring number of aspirants. The trend even took a new dimension recently with the overwhelming number of candidates vying for the presidential seat under the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and other political parties.\n\nHowever, while the large number of political gladiators in the presidential race may be unprecedented and could be overwhelming for delegates across board, the wheat can be separated from the chaff by the assessment of their evidence-based track record and undefiled antecedent as well as the will power to act.\n\nThe paradigm shift from government to governance and from fruitless clich\u00e9s to realistic and pragmatic development is now on the horizon.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer news that the terrifying challenges in the country in all sectors requires a candidate that is indisputably fit to be a flag bearer of the PDP in the imminent presidential race.\n\nConversely, if the foregoing attributes of a suitable candidate that could sail the boat of Nigeria to the admirable destination is anything to go by, then I can confidently assure you that the search is over at the discovery of a man who is worth his weight in gold, called Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal.\n\nWe are living witnesses to the daunting challenges facing our nation. It is needless to start mentioning them because Nigerians are wearing the shoe and they know where it pinches. Also, the solutions to these challenges are well known and some even documented in blueprints of various Ministries, Departments and (MDAs) of government at all levels. However, the missing link is the political will to ACT!\n\nAmid these irregularities, the PDP, having lost two consecutive presidential elections in the last seven years, now has another opportunity to elect a qualified candidate who knows his onions to face the ruling party in the contest and deliver victory to the main opposition party, hence the popular choice of His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, CFR.\n\nWhy is Tambuwal Suitably Qualified?\n\nRt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal apart from being a trained Lawyer and life member of Body of Benchers, has been an astute public servant and Chief Executive Officer at two separate arms of government: Legislature and Executive. He is a man of unquestionable character throughout his over two-decade political career.\n\nNow that Nigerians are more divided than ever before, the PDP needs someone that is acceptable to all Nigerians across ethno-religious divide to score its political goals. Having travelled all the 360 constituencies of Nigeria as a former Speaker of House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Tambuwal is a true unifier who understands the country\u2019s diversity and can manage it well as demonstrated by the handling of all the appointments at the 7th House of Representative during his stewardship as the Speaker.\n\nBesides, the party needs someone like Tambuwal not only because of his stellar reputation, but capacity, competence and character and all it takes to win an election.\n\nOn security; as part of his commitment to strengthening formidable security apparatus in the state included signing into law the Security Challenges (Containment) Order, provision of over 500 vehicles and 765 motorcycles as well as 132 housing as well as information gathering drones to federal security agencies. Not to leave out fueling of the vehicles and regular payment of their allowances.\n\nTambuwal understands the issues regarding the daunting insecurity in Nigeria and he will work with relevant stakeholders in strategizing and deploying the requisite resources and technology towards tackling this challenge across the country.\n\nStrike actions are now recurring decimal in the academic calendar of our higher institutions, from the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) to the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics ASUP taking turns to downtool, while their counterpart at the Colleges of Education (COEASU) are equally drumming to follow suit.\n\nWhile this nonchalant attitude by the federal government towards education which is considered the bedrock of national development is highly condemnable, the PDP can be rest assured that the current storm in the nation\u2019s education sector would soon be over when Tambuwal clinches the party\u2019s presidential ticket and goes to win at the general elections.\n\nThe answer is simple! Proper funding and adequate allocation has been the major challenge of these higher institutions and that would definitely not be a problem under the watch of Tambuwal, who is currently allocating 29% of the Sokoto State budget to education, surpassing the UNESCO\u2019s recommendation of 26%. The gesture had earned him several UNESCO awards of Excellence in the funding of Education.\n\nObviously, the enormous task of the presidency and the huge challenges in various sectors in the country require a vibrant leader who would not be running the affairs of the country from the hospital, thus the leading PDP presidential aspirant (Tambuwal) is the right choice being a bridge builder between the younger and older generation. Specifically, at 56 he is not too young to run and not too old to lead.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s fiscal policies in Sokoto State are topnotch. He revived the industrial and commercial sector, got the federal government\u2019s nod as the best performing state following the disbursement of N123.34bn grants to states. The federal government also applauded the governor\u2019s leadership style on ease of doing business in Nigeria, being the second best performing state across the country.\n\nAlso, his track record on Transparency and Accountability has proven the fact that he is capable of tackling the endemic corrupt practices in the country. This is evident in the recent World Bank record rating Sokoto as the most transparent state in Nigeria for its commitment to the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability programme after the implementation of the Bank\u2019s $22million grant.\n\nTambuwal administration initiated automation of Internally Generated Revenue IGR, paving the way for no-cash policy and blocking loopholes. He also edged out ghost workers through his Payroll Harmonization and Modernization initiative. These feats could also be expanded to rescue the current-sinking economy of Nigeria from total collapse if the symbol of good governance (Tambuwal) is given the opportunity.\n\nOn worker\u2019s welfare, Sokoto state was amongst the first states in Nigeria to comply with the N30,000 minimum wage and ensures prompt payment of salaries in the state, at the same time the government has cleared the backlog of gratuity of over 2.5 billion and 1.2 billion in 2016 and 2017 respectively and still sustains the monthly payment of 100 million.\n\nOn 35% Affirmative Action, Sokoto state scored high with 3 Female Commissioners, 3 Permanent Secretaries, 7 DGs, 4 Special Advisers, 69 Councilors and many Directors and Heads of Departments.\n\nIn addition to his qualities, he symbolizes Good governance and from his background he understands the workings of the Judiciary, Legislature and the Executive arms of government. He is widely accepted across ethno-religious divide and possesses the right Temperament; these are important factors to Nigeria\u2019s stability and prosperity.\n\nThis is a passionate appeal to party faithful and delegates nationwide to take advantage of this opportunity to right all the wrongs and vote with conscience as we can\u2019t afford to get it wrong this time.\n\nI plead with us to vote with nobility remembering that we have no other country than Nigeria and we are all in this ship together. It is important to note; the choice you make at the primaries will determine if the ship successfully sails to shore or sinks in the deep seas.\n\nNigeria\u2019s fate is pinned on you to present a credible and detribalized candidate. We are counting on your patriotism to vote right and ensure your votes count.\n\nWith our aggravated challenges, bringing our country back from the brink is an economic, moral, political and social imperative.

          "text": "Hacked-off thorn branches encircle two mounds of earth heaped over the tiny bodies of Halima Hassan Abdullahi\u2019s twin granddaughters. Babies Ebla and Abdia lived only a day.\n\nWeakened by hunger, their mother gave birth to the twins a month early, eight weeks after their exhausted family walked into a camp for displaced families in the Somali town of Dollow.\n\n\u201cShe is malnourished and her two babies died of hunger,\u201d Abdullahi said at the Kaxareey camp which sprang up in January and now houses 13,000 people.\n\nThey are among more than 6 million Somalis who need aid to survive.\n\nAfter rains failed for four consecutive seasons, the worst drought in 40 years has shrivelled their beans and maize and dotted scrubland with the corpses of their goats and donkeys.\n\nWith global focus on Ukraine, aid agencies and the United Nations are desperate to attract attention to a calamity they say is shaping up to be comparable to Somalia\u2019s 2011 famine.\n\nMore than a quarter of a million people died then, mostly children under five.\n\nThere is only enough cash for about half the people in the Kaxareey camp. Abdullahi\u2019s family is not one of the lucky ones.\n\nShe has not seen anything like it since the early 1990s, when a famine helped trigger a disastrous U.S. military intervention in Somalia that ended notoriously with the shooting down of a Black Hawk helicopter.\n\nHer family had never had to leave their land before, she said.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nOn good days, Abdullahi can support the 13 members of her family by washing clothes in town, earning about 1.50 dollars.\n\nThat enables everyone to have a single handful of maize porridge.\n\nBut it is not enough. Her daughter-in-law needs medicine for typhoid that costs ten times Abdullahi\u2019s daily wages.\n\nThe girl lies listlessly on a blanket, a skinny baby fretting at her breast. A high-heeled red shoe with a diamante clasp lies in the dirt nearby, one of the few possessions she carried from their sunblasted home.\n\nNow she is too weak to even say her name.\n\n\u201cAbdiya,\u201d Abdullahi says quietly, trying to rouse her.\n\nThe girl does not look up.\n\nEarly intervention is crucial to staving off famine looming over six areas of Somalia, which is home to around 15 million people in a region highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.\n\nGetting food out fast meant that a drought in 2017 \u2013 worse than the one that caused the 2011 famine \u2013 cost under 1,000 lives.\n\nBut speed requires cash. And it is in short supply.\n\nThe UN plan to provide emergency aid is only 15% funded.\n\nSo far, 2.8 million people have received aid. Another 3.1 million could be helped if more money came in.\n\nThe rest are out of reach, residing in parched hinterlands where an Islamist insurgency holds sway.\n\n\u201cWe need the cash to avert the risk of famine,\u201d said Rukia Yacoub, deputy director for the World Food Programme in East Africa.\n\nIn the camp, people make homes from orange tarpaulins and scraps of cloth and plastic stretched over domes of sticks.\n\nHammering echoes as relief workers set up pit latrines with corrugated iron sheets. New arrivals cluster around tents where aid staff tell them there is no help for now.\n\nInstead, many families end up begging for a cup of food or a few pennies from those barely better off, but who arrived early enough to register for help.\n\nHunger often weakens the children before diseases claim them. Asha Ali Osman, 25, lost her three-year-old and four-year-old to measles a month ago.\n\nNow she cradles her youngest, a baby, as she waits to secure the girl a vaccination in Dollow.\n\n\u201cI feel so much pain because I cannot even breastfeed her,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cWhen my children are hungry, I can beg for some sugar water from a neighbour. Or sometimes we just lie down together, and cry.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, has declared curfew in eight local government areas of the state as a result of insecurity, occasioned by gunmen attacks.\n\nSoludo, in a state wide broadcast made on Wednesday evening, enjoined the people of the state to join hands with him to achieve his dream of making Anambra a liveable and prosperous homeland.\n\nReferring to criminal gangs in the broadcast, Soludo said: \u201cThe tiny but vicious gangs that have invaded our state and terrorising us are mostly in eight local governments in Anambra and three neighboring local governments in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThey are in our forests, communities, and houses owned by individuals. They don\u2019t come from the air, and hence are not \u201cunknown\u201d gunmen. They are known. You know them, but are either too scared to speak up or out of indifference. But for how long will you be silent while our people continue to be killed in the most cruel and barbaric manner?\n\n\u201cThe security agencies will continue to do their part, but we the people, must proclaim that Enough is Enough and demonstrate full ownership.\u201d\n\nAs part of ways to curb the menace, Soludo unveiled more phone numbers to be used by citizens of the state to report suspected cases of crime.\n\nHe also added: \u201cWith effect from tomorrow, Thursday, May 26, 2022, a 6pm to 6am curfew is hereby placed on motorcycles (okada), tricycles (keke), and shuttle buses in Aguata, Ihiala, Ekwusigo, Nnewi North, Nnewi South, Ogbaru, Orumba North and Orumba South Local Governments until further notice.\n\n\u201cUntil further notice also, motorcycles, keke and shuttle buses are banned from operating in these local governments on Mondays until the Sit-at-Home completely stops. The youths of every community in the zone are hereby enjoined to assist the security agencies in the implementation of this policy and are mandated to seize any such motorcycle or tricycle on the spot.\n\n\u201cLocal Vigilantes should report such motorcycles or tricycles (keke) immediately, and they will be confiscated by the government and the owner prosecuted. The Okada, Keke, and shuttle bus union leaders must take responsibility to report their members who are involved in criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWe shall review this after two weeks, and if members of these unions continue to be involved in criminal activities, the government will have no choice but to either disband the Unions and/or ban them out rightly in the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor said no part of Anambra State shall be used as camps for criminals, and anyone with a gun in a camp will be considered a criminal in Anambra State, and the government and people will work with security agencies to flush them out.\n\nHe added that the state government shall also revoke and acquire any land found to be harboring criminals, while every community is required to provide information on any part of their land occupied by these criminals as camps, and if the community fails to do so, the government will take over such land.\n\nHe said the same applies to any buildings found to be harboring kidnappers and murderers who have laid siege on the state.\n\nSoludo also added that while hotels are to find a way to get the identity of lodgers seeking their accommodation, fuel stations are to install CCTV cameras, and keep their recordings, which will be demanded once demanded by security agencies, during investigation.",

My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs,\u201d Obi had said.\n\nReacting, some Nigerians on social media said Obi left the party due to the crisis in Anambra PDP and corruption in the party.\n\nHere are some comments DAILY POST curated;\n\n@firstladyship, \u201cPeter Obi will defeat the PDP and the APC in any party. The Office of the citizens of Nigeria is the highest office in the land. This organic support has taken off. They can no longer stop us. Only God can. Obi is an idea whose time has come.

While 25 contenders submitted forms, sources said 28 were undergoing screening.\n\nThe APC fixed screening of its aspirants for Monday, but put it off indefinitely on Sunday night. No reason was given.\n\nBut the Presidential primary will hold between Sunday and Monday at the Eagles Square in Abuja.\n\nAdamu said: \u201cThe party has laid down its rules and regulations for the aspirants. We would scrutinize all of them based on our guidelines to be sure we pick the right candidate for the party.\u201d\n\nAsked if a consensus arrangement being contemplated by the party is similar to how he (Adamu) emerged as the chairman, the former Nasarawa governor, said: \u201cThere is no truth in what you said. The reason is the chairmanship seat is not the same as that of the tussle for the presidency of the country. You can\u2019t even compare the two of them. That question does not arise.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop our party stalwart from contesting election or aspiring for the presidency. It is their right and we are happy for them. There is nothing wrong with anybody aspiring for the exalted seat of the presidency. It is God that decides who gets what. Once God makes up his mind and says this is who He wants that is what we are praying for.\n\n\u201cWe have 28 aspirants for the presidential ticket and everybody knows that all of them cannot get the ticket. If it\u2019s God\u2019s wish they all can even be president of the country one after the other. Our is to ensure justice in the choice of who emerges candidate of the party. That does not mean we are perfect. But we pray we do the right thing.\u201d\n\nOn zoning, the chairman said the party would decide this after screening the aspirants. \u201cWe have not produced our candidate for president yet. We have to screen the aspirants to know the way forward. We have aspirants from across the country in the race. We will make the decision when we get there.\u201d",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja; Nwanosike Onu, Awka and Raymond Mordi\n\nEx-governor weighs LP, SDP options\n\nWhy he dumped main opposition party\n\nFormer Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant Peter Obi may either join the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the Labour Party (LP) or the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) to puruse his ambition, it was learnt yesterday.\n\nThe former governor of Anambra State, who quit the race also dumped the opposition party, which he had defected to from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in 2018.\n\nObi was running mate to the 2019 presidential candidate of the party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nHis exit may have dimmed hope for PDP presidential aspirants from the Southeast.\n\nSources said Obi was uncomfortable with the neglect of zoning by the PDP and its decision to throw the ticket open to aspirants from the North and South.\n\nObi\u2019s resignation was shocking to many party chieftains, who believed he had run a neat campaign ahead of the primary scheduled for Saturday.\n\nHaving been frustrated in PDP, Obi is said to be weighing options between the SDP and the LP for his presidential aspiration, the source said.\n\nIt was learnt that talks were going underground between Obi and the two parties.\n\nAn insider in Obi\u2019s camp, who spoke with our correspondent, said Obi\u2019s resignation from PDP did not amount to withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nThe source, who is a confidant of the former governor, said: \u201cObi has not given up his presidential ambition, but he only left the PDP to pursue his aspiration elsewhere. That is the position now.\n\n\u201cFrom the evaluation of the situation in PDP, the gang up of governors and some leaders of the party against him was obvious. It was apparent to him that the presidential primary was not going to be free and fair. Some governors and PDP leaders have shown that Obi was not wanted.\n\nRead Also: More heavy weights lose PDP senatorial tickets\n\n\u201cI think the affected governors and party leaders were not too pleased with his integrity and rising popularity.\n\n\u201cAlso, Obi was shocked that the party leadership allegedly distorted the PDP zoning formula by leaving its presidential ticket open instead of zoning it to the South, especially the Southeast, which has been marginalised. He couldn\u2019t believe it that PDP was not straightforward on zoning.\u201d\n\nInvestigation confirmed last night that Obi was weighing options for his presidential ambition.\n\nThe source added: \u201cIt is not yet over for Obi. He is going to contest the 2023 presidency on a different party.\n\n\u201cI am aware that there are ongoing talks with SDP and Labour Party for Obi to use any of them as a platform for his presidential aspiration.\n\n\u201cPart of the talks was for him to leave PDP because Electoral Act 2022 does not allow an aspirant to participate in two primaries. As a man of honour, he has opted to try his luck elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that the campaign period is longer and he will be able to sell his ideas to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAsked if Obi can realise his ambition on either SDP or LP platform, the source said: \u201cNobody knows what will come out of the primaries in the All Progressives Congress (APC) and PDP. Some parties may end up serving as coalition platforms for 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cObi may be a pacesetter anyway. Do not rule out anything. How did #EndSARS protest start? The resignation may trigger new developments and new alliances.\u201d\n\nAnother source said the NNPP, led by Senator Rabiu Kwakwanso, was making overtures to the former governor.\n\nObi\u2019s resignation letter was submitted to the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu.\n\nThe letter, dated May 24, 2022, also conveyed his withdrawal from the race.\n\nThe letter was delivered at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja by his campaign coordinator, Dr. Doyin Okupe.\n\nThe letter stated: \u201cI am writing to intimate you of my resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2. Anaocha LGA Anambra, effective Friday 20 May, 2022.\n\n\u201cConsequently, am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal for the PDP presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cIt has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.\n\n\u201cOur national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country.\u201d\n\nOkupe told reporters that Obi will be on the ballot in the 2023 presidential race.\n\nThere are speculations that the former Anambra governor might have quietly joined the Labour Party (LP) where he is said to have been offered the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nOkupe said: \u201cYou will recall that consistently, former Governor Peter Obi has repeatedly stated that he\u2019s not desperate to be President, but he\u2019s desperate to cause a change, to cause a redirection, to change the way the government of Nigeria is being run and it\u2019s for this reason and to offer solution to the various problems of Nigeria\n\n\u201cIt was for these reasons that he entered into the race. According to what he said in his letter, various developments in the PDP, make it virtually impossible for him to find full expression of his desire on the platform of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that all hopes are lost. I can say on his behalf that Nigerians must not give up, we must never give up. Hope is on its way and help is coming.\n\n\u201cAll options are on the table, by the grace of God Obi\u2019s name will be on the ballot in 2023.\u201d\n\nFormer Anambra State Publicity Secretary of the party, Sir Nnamdi Nwangwu, described Obi\u2019s resignation as a big loss to Anambra and indeed, Southeast PDP.\n\nHe said: \u201cHonestly, this is a big shock to me and the Party State. PDP has lost a motivator and a respected leader. We will miss him and the Party will miss him the more.\u201d\n\nObi should not have left PDP, says George\n\nLagos PDP leader Chief Olabode George expressed surprise over the decision of Peter Obi to leave the party after pulling out of the presidential race.\n\nGeorge, who spoke on Channels Television\u2019s, Politics Today, said politics is not a hundred-metre race, adding that in a political race, you win some and lose some. He said that Obi, who he described as \u201ca highly respectable and responsible gentleman\u201d, should have remained within the fold because the race is not over yet.\n\nHowever, the PDP chieftain said Obi may have other plans. He said Nigeria should not be compared to the United States of America (USA) which has a democratic culture that spans over 200 years. But, even America\u2019s democracy, he added, is not perfect.\n\nGeorge said: \u201cI was taken aback because Obi Peter has established himself as a highly respectable and responsible gentleman; very resourceful, in all endeavours of life. But, for him to have dumped the PDP, I don\u2019t know why he did that. It\u2019s a pity that he actually dumped the party. Life is full of imponderables; you can\u2019t win all the time.\n\n\u201cMy appeal to everybody in this country is that we should not compare Nigeria to America. America is over 200 years old, but even its democracy is not perfect. We are still like a toddler when you are talking about democratic dispensation.\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, it would take time; democratic practice is not a 100-metre dash race; it is a continuum and you win some and you lose some.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is that after every election, there would be a post mortem analysis that would look at the failures, the drawbacks and make amends for us to start growing.\u201d",

This was after the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) urged the President to urgently intervene and put a halt to what it described as an irretrievable disaster in the Southeast.\n\nIn the statement by Buhari\u2019s Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu, the Presidency also urged Nigerians to refrain from indiscriminate sharing of contents capable of inciting violent reactions from the public.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cThe Presidency wishes to caution against any knee-jerk reactions, the creation of panic, disruption of lives and livelihoods, or even retaliatory violence following the viral videos of the alleged killings of non-indigenes by the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and its mother terrorist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\n\u201cWhile expert agencies are now verifying the factuality and veracity of the claims that accompany the horrid pictures being circulated, we call on all citizens to avoid hasty steps or conclusions that could exacerbate the situation, and on the contrary keep to a line of conduct that will help the law to take its proper course.\n\n\u201cThe Presidency also cautions the public against the indiscriminate sharing of posts on social media so as to deny vested interests who seek to divide us and create disturbance the chance to do so.\n\n\u201cIn the issuance of his very strong condemnation of these \u201cwild, barbarous and wanton killings of innocent people\u201d in the Southeast as well as the other parts of the country, which he described as \u201cdeeply distressing,\u201d President Buhari warns the perpetrators of these acts to expect a tough response from the security forces.\u201d.\n\nYesterday, Soludo dispatched a delegation led by Commissioner for Information Paul Nwosu, to the Hausa community at the Cattle Market in Amansea.\n\nThe governor, who condoled with Jubril Ahmed, the husband of late pregnant woman,, expressed shock at how people could be killed in cold blood.\n\nPointing out that the Igbo and other tribes had lived together for so long in peace, he urged all non-indigenes in the state to go about their lawful businesses.\n\nLeader of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria MACBAN in the Southeast Gidado Sidikki described the incident as horrible.\n\nHe, however, thanked the governor for sending the delegation and pledged their readiness to continue working with the government to enthrone peace in the state.\n\nSidiki noted that the people living and doing business in the state were aware that they were not the target of the Sunday attack. He recalled the heading of a member of the State House of Assembly by gunmen.\n\nIn condemning the Anambra incident, NEF alleged that there are some people who are bent on destroying the country through killings..\n\nThe forum advised Southeast leaders to assist Buhari in tackling the menace and called on Nigerians \u201cto resist any temptation to resort to violence under the impression that revenge is a solution to the targeting of particular groups.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Says action aimed at supporting economic growth, price stability\n\nJames Emejo and Nume Ekeghe in Abuja\n\n\n\nAfter holding the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), yesterday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the apex bank lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of funds in the economy.\n\nThe MPC, however, left other monetary policy parameters, including the apex bank\u2019s Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR), unchanged at 27.5 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of the MPC, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, admitted that the hike in MPR would increase cost of borrowing, especially in non-priority sectors of the economy.\n\nEmefiele, however added that lending to key priority sectors, which had been identified to boost growth and generate employment, would remain at single-digit interest rate of nine per cent.\n\nThe central bank governor pointed out that the decision to raise interest rate was the last resort and a difficult one for the MPC, which had been crafting policies to stimulate economic growth as well as achieve financial stability. He said the CBN had adopted a contractionary monetary policy stance in view of the aggressive rise in inflation in recent times, which had led to high food and commodity prices in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that CBN\u2019s action was aimed at curbing inflation, on the one hand, and supporting growth of the economy, on the other. He said the MPC was in a dilemma in arriving at a decision to raise the lending rate. As a result, the apex bank governor explained, a drastic measure such as raising the benchmark lending rate was required to reduce monetary expansion in order to tame inflation.\n\nHe assured that though inflation was expected to maintain an aggressive acceleration in the coming months, the central bank would not hesitate to return to its accommodative stance whenever it saw a reduction in the headline index.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe concerns about the global rise in inflation and price levels; you all would have seen that the price of crude quite unexpectedly has been above $100 per barrel. In fact, Nigeria\u2019s Bonny light yesterday, when we started the meeting, was about $116 per barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the standard pricing indicator; yes, whereas crude prices have gone up per barrel, at the same time the cost of refining and ultimate pump price at the station would naturally have gone up.\n\n\u201cThis is a global phenomenon and I was watching the CNN a few days ago and one of the analysts was talking about an incredible distortion to financial markets in the United States, and I said, yes, we are all welcome to a situation where inflation is rising to unprecedented levels in the US and other economies, growth is also coming down.\n\n\u201cAnd if you must tackle inflation, prices, and at the same time you want growth, then you know that you are faced with some compelling dilemma as to what to do.\n\n\u201cYou like to see inflation come down but at the same time you want growth to go up. But to achieve that, you have to take two decisions that are in opposite directions and that brings to bear what type of skills you have put in place to ensure you are able to manage these two in a way that you maintain a balance when you see a moderation in inflation and at the same time you grow your economy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFor us in Nigeria, you would have observed that in the last two and a half years, what we have been doing is that we want to pursue a policy of price stability that is conducive to growth and that\u2019s why somehow we have used our development finance intervention facilities, we have actually yielded positive results and helped to drive growth in our economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used that to drive growth while at the same time we try as much as possible to maintain a hold position while looking at the optimum level of liquidity in the industry to be able to moderate inflation at a level that does not hurt the growth and economy of our country.\n\n\u201cBut with what we have seen globally either in the areas of the supply chain, increases in prices of petroleum products, and the rest of them, we have seen aggressive growth in inflation in Nigeria between March and April of 2022.\n\n\u201cAnd the forecast from our statisticians, including the NBS and CBN as well as our colleagues in research and monetary policy, is that unless something drastic or significant actions are taken, it will be difficult for us to really rein in inflation if we don\u2019t do something immediately.\n\n\u201cThis decision has been taken because we felt that there may continue in the next couple of months to be an aggressive acceleration in inflation and we think there is a need to take some drastic actions to reverse it.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to see a reversal, perhaps, we can say we are returning to what we can call the normal period, when we are looking at using CRR to moderate inflation and at the same time using our development finance to really push for growth.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the broad outlook for both the global and domestic economies in the medium-term remained clouded with uncertainties arising from the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine, the unfolding impact of the extensive sanctions imposed by several countries on Russia, and the downside risks from the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe added that global growth was confronted with significant headwinds, which might derail the current projection further, adding that the continuing rise in inflation is also set to undermine the recovery of output growth due to the associated build-up of uncertainties around the cost of inventory and other production inputs.\n\nThe CBN governor said the rise in global debt was also an unfolding dilemma, which policymakers must carefully evaluate and address to avert a near-term global financial crisis.\n\nIn summary, he said, while global aggregate demand remained strong and growing, the numerous supply-side constraints would continue to undermine the recovery effort, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nIn the domestic economy, the CBN governor noted that data on key macroeconomic variables indicated that the recovery of output growth will continue, probably at a more subdued pace, considering the unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy.\n\nHe said domestic price development was, however, expected to maintain an upward pressure in light of the build-up of spending related to the 2023 general election.\n\nThe MPC noted the risks confronting the global economy involved not only inflation and prices, but also included risks associated with weakening growth prospects across the world.\n\nThe committee observed that whereas post-pandemic policy support remained broadly expansionary, at least, from a fiscal standpoint, the sharp rise in inflation across both the advanced and emerging markets economies had generated growing concern among central banks, as the progressive rise in inflation, driven by rising aggregate demand and wage growth, was putting unsustainable upward pressure on price levels.\n\nConsequently, Emefiele said, major central banks, such as the US Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada, had provided strong guidance for a progressive shift away from monetary policy accommodation to drive market interest rate upward, which may ultimately impact capital flow away from Emerging Market Economies.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn another hand, MPC noted that the war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in significant disruption of the global supply chain, at a time when the global economy is still confronted with downside risks to growth associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to this, global trade has been impacted by the series of restrictions imposed by NATO countries and its allies against trade with Russia.\n\n\u201cThis has increasingly fragmented the global economy, imposing huge strains on the tepid post-pandemic recovery. Only recently, China, the USA, and South Africa are seeing a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the Chinese government recently re-introduced lockdown in major industrial cities, to forestall the spread of the pandemic, further disrupting the supply chain crisis. In the view of the MPC, these two risks pose great challenges to rising inflation globally.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the CBN governor said on the decision on whether to hold, tighten or loosen, the MPC felt that loosening in the face of the rising policy rates in advanced economies might result in a sharp rise in capital outflow and faster dry-up of foreign credit lines.\n\nEmefiele stated, \u201cMPC also feels that loosening could lead to further liquidity surfeit and inflationary pressure. So as to whether to hold, MPC feels its stance would strengthen the perception that the CBN has abandoned its primary mandate of taming inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the need to tighten, MPC feels that tightening would help moderate the inflationary trade-off from the steady growth recovery so far. MPC also feels that tightening would help rein in inflation before it assumes a galloping trend, considering the progressive increase in headline inflation (m-o-m), particularly with the sharp 90 basis point increase in April 2022.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cFurthermore, MPC feels that tightening would narrow the negative real interest rate margin, improve market sentiment, and restore investor confidence.\n\n\u201cEqually, members believe tightening would moderate inflationary pressure pass-through to exchange rate depreciation and moderate the speed of capital flow reversal, provide incentives for foreign capital inflows, and sustain remittances.\n\n\u201cLastly, tightening could moderate government domestic borrowing, as government debt servicing to revenue ratio increased significantly in recent times, threatening debt sustainability.\u201d\n\nHe said MPC members expressed deep concern about the continued uptrend of inflationary pressure, despite the gradual improvement in output growth.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe committee noted that the current rise in inflation may be inimical to growth and, thus, hinder the full recovery of the economy. While the MPC identified several supply-side factors, which may be contributing to inflationary pressure, emerging evidence shows that money demand pressure is on the rise and is unlikely to abate until the 2023 general elections are concluded.\n\n\u201cThe dilemma confronting the committee at this meeting, therefore, is how best to drive down domestic prices while continuing to support the fragile recovery.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing the developments of the last two months and the outlook for both the domestic and global economies, as well as the benefits and downsides of each policy option, the committee decided to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to rein in the current rise in inflation, as members were of the view that the continued uptrend would adversely affect growth.\u201d\n\nAnalysts React to MPR Hike\n\nCommenting on the MPR adjustment by the CBN, Investment Analyst, Ayodeji Ebo, noted that the rate hike came as a surprise considering the magnitude and a major drift from the previous stance of the CBN. According to him, raising MPR will not necessarily translate to increased foreign portfolio investments due to the foreign exchange challenges.\n\nEbo told THISDAY, \u201cThis will lead to the high cost of borrowing for firms and the government. As a result, lead to a higher cost of production and a higher inflation rate. This will make the stock market less attractive, leading to a downtrend. Also, the fixed income market will be bearish in the interim, as traders try to minimise losses on their portfolios.\u201d\n\nFounder and Chief Executive of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), an economic and business advocacy think tank, Dr. Muda Yusuf, explained that while the hike in MPR by 150 basis points to 13 per cent by the MPC was understandable, \u201cwhether this would significantly impact on the inflation is a different matter.\u201d\n\nYusuf said, \u201cAlready, bank lending has been constrained by the high CRR (many operators in the sector claim that effective CRR is as high as 50 per cent or more for many banks), the discretionary debits by the apex bank, the 65 per cent Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) and liquidity ratio of 30 per cent. The lending situation in the economy is already very tight.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy is not a credit-driven economy, unlike what obtains in many advanced economies, which have much higher levels of financial inclusion, robust consumer credit framework and strong correlation between interest rate and aggregate demand.\n\n\u201cThe level of financial inclusion in the Nigerian economy is still quite low, access to credit by households and MSMEs is still very challenging, and the informal sector accounts for close to 50 per cent of the economy.\u201d\n\nYusuf added, \u201cThe transmission effects of monetary policy on the economy are, therefore, still very weak. In the Nigerian context, price levels are not interest-sensitive. Supply-side issues are much more profound drivers of inflation. What the recent rate hike means for the economy is that the cost of credit to the few beneficiaries of the bank credits will increase, which will impact their operating costs, prices of their products and profit margins. Investors in the fixed income instruments may also benefit from the hike. There would be some adverse effects on the equities market.\u201d\n\nHead, Financial Institutions Ratings at Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi, said the hike was not surprising, considering the rising inflation as well as the tilting of members of the MPC in favour of a hike in rates in previous meetings.\n\nAccording to Olubunmi, \u201cIf you have been following the communiqu\u00e9 of individual members, you would notice that gradually over the last couple of months, most members have moved from maintaining to an increase. At the last meeting, it was just a narrow decision for them to maintain it.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising and if looked at in the context of what is happening globally, interest rates are rising and one of the major ways the CBN can actually make Nigeria look a bit more competitive is for them to raise rates.\n\n\u201cGlobally, inflation rate is also increasing and in Nigeria, while there are other factors that contribute to rising inflation, one of the ways of combating that is to also raise rates.\n\n\u201cAlso, with electioneering, there would be a significant increase in money in circulation and one of the ways to try reduce the effect of that transmitting to higher inflation is to actually raise rates.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says power shift against democratic principles, zoning a lazy argument\n\n\u2022Declares \u2018I\u2019m going in to win, my message has resonated well\u2019\n\n\u2022Reveals Abiola invested almost 25 years of goodwill across the country\n\n\u2022Believes anyone who wants to be president should work hard, build alliances\n\nObinna Chima, Goddy Egene and Peter Uzoho\n\n\n\nFormer Managing Director of FSB International Bank Plc., and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has said if the main opposition party is able to get its act together in terms of organisation and envisaging the antics of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), PDP would win the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential interview series, Hayatu-Deen, punctured arguments in favour of zoning or power shift. He said it was unreasonable for the country to be bogged down by power shift clamour and debate, stressing that the argument for zoning is not only lazy but also against democratic principles.\n\nHe said if he had been asked the question on zoning some weeks back, he would have loved to spend some quality time on the subject. But PDP had already deferred to wisdom by throwing its presidential ticket open, he stated.\n\nAnalysing the chances of PDP in next year\u2019s general election, Hayatu-Deen, who explained the rationale behind the proposed consensus northern candidate and why it failed, said, \u201cLet me say that the reason for putting in place that framework for producing a consensus candidate from the northern part of the country was informed by two or three reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the field was getting large both in the north and in the south to the point where it would become difficult to manage at the convention.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the election of 2023 is PDP\u2019s to lose and if caution is not exercised, APC may actually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat if we have an acrimonious convention.\n\n\u201cThirdly was that the consensus arrangement was actually going to happen in stages. That the north should reduce the field to one person or maximum of two and, second, that this particular message should actually also be taken to the southern part of the country. At the time, we knew more people were going to come out, but only Pius Anyim had come out as at the time.\n\n\u201cLo and behold, after a few weeks, there were far more contestants in the southern part of the country than the north. So, we now started going to various parts of the country, preaching to the governors of the PDP to do other things in their powers to actually shrink the field in the south so that when we go to the convention, we\u2019ll have few people to narrow this process.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, the consensus arrangement in the north fell apart simply because the candidates felt that the basis for it existed no more and, therefore, it was better for each person to actually run their own independent campaign. In so doing, taking cognisance of two things: that we would be able to establish very good relationships among ourselves.\n\n\u201cAlso, it provided a teaching moment as we go to the convention to begin to put together some kind of framework even before the convention as to how these things will coalesce and still have a very successful convention and produce a candidate. So, those were the reasons.\u201d\n\nDismissing the idea of zoning, Hayatu-Deen stated, \u201cThis issue has been up in the air and travelling at just 1000 miles per hour, it\u2019s now an open and shut case that has gone to the highest policymaking body of the party and they decided to open it up for all. Let me tell you this, first, in 1999, beginning from preparations in 1998, this is now almost 23 to 24 years, there was a major event that took place during MKO Abiola\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cFollowed by a lot of commotion from many places, leading up to 1998, it was decided by the party bigwigs that given what had happened, it was important for us to stabilise this country, to hand over power to somebody from the South-west to compensate the denial of Abiola\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThere was no constitutional provision, there was no referendum taken among the south, and this is how the world works. It was an open contest. People like Abubakar Rimi, Philip Asiodu, and others ran to me and contested about that. That was a private arrangement that was done. So, we were able to organise to shift the votes to Obasanjo. Secondly, it\u2019s now almost a generation and after 23 years, we are still bogged down with power shift. I think it\u2019s unreasonable.\n\n\u201cThirdly, it goes against the principles of democracy as far as I\u2019m concerned. You cannot shut anyone out under a democratic contest. Anybody who is eligible that meets the criteria to either vote for somebody or be voted for, let him go on. I refuse to accept the lazy argument that this thing should be zoned and given to a particular zone.\n\n\u201cAbiola invested almost 20 to 25 years of goodwill across the country. Tofa, who was a very popular person in Kano, lost Kano to Abiola. Anybody from the South-east or South-south or the north, who wants to become president, should go and do that hard work and build alliances. Nigerians are good people. If you show them that you actually have their back and you are waiting for them, you will be amazed.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated further, \u201cIn 1999, a large section of the northern establishment, over 80 per cent of them, who were military were backing Alex Ekwueme for the presidency. As journalists, I will encourage you to send messages to people to actually go out there and build friendship and relationships and sow the seeds.\n\n\u201cYou will be surprised that an Ibibio or an Igbo guy or Ijaw man can easily get elected president, because the democratic space is very free and very open, and it\u2019s all about relationships. That investment has to happen. There is no reason why Mohammed Hayatu-Deen should be prevented from exercising his own democratic and human rights. That\u2019s my answer to that question.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his chances at the PDP presidential primary this weekend, Hayatu-Deen said, \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t go into anything without actually reflecting very carefully about it. Secondly, the reason why I went in is not because I want anything out of it personally for myself, my family or my friends.\n\n\u201cI see this country standing on a brink, almost approaching a failed state. All the sounds and stress are there for who wants to see; the structural holes, the cracks are there for anybody to see. I don\u2019t want to be a bystander watching what is going on, only for my conscience to say, if something terrible happens, what were you doing then? That you decided to stay in your private comfort and you refused to get into the murky waters of politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to hold me accountable down the road and say, \u2018daddy, what were you doing?\u2019 Or ordinary Nigerians to say, \u2018we know this guy, he has so much to offer, he\u2019s sitting down, because he doesn\u2019t want any mud on his face.\u2019 I think the time for courageous people in civil society space, in the private space has come.\n\n\u201cThere is no better time than now for us to enrich the pool of politicians in this country and get many men and women of quality and distinction, who are going to be there not because they are going to help themselves, not because they are going to help their friends and families, but because they believe they have something they can give.\u201d\n\nThe former banker added, \u201cI have done my maths very carefully and I\u2019m going in to win and my message has resonated very well with all of the delegates that I have actually visited. And it\u2019s a competitive race, I know there are many competitors there, but we have grand deals worked out and I\u2019m confident that I will put up a very good showing at the primaries coming up this week.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Teargas was also used inside Okorocha\u2019s residence by the operatives before whisking him off at 6:41pm, THISDAY gathered.\n\nOperatives of the commission had earlier yesterday stormed the Maitama, Abuja residence of Okorocha to effect his arrest. But Okorocha raised the alarm that the siege to his Abuja residence by men of the anti-graft agency was part of a grand plan to truncate his presidential ambition.\n\nThe senator, who addressed journalists inside his room, said the EFCC, which later reinforced and returned with additional men, had threatened to break the doors and forcefully take him away on the day of the APC presidential screening.\n\nOkorocha said, \u201dFrankly speaking, the situation I find myself is what I call hostage.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Uber crosses 1 billion rides in Africa",
          "text": "American ride-hailing giant Uber recently announced that it has completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nThe company first launched in Africa in 2013, establishing a presence in Johannesburg, South Africa. Since then, it has expanded to operate in 7 other countries: Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ivory Coast, with UberEats, its food delivery arm, available in several South African cities as well as Nairobi, Kenya. In 2018, it launched an intercity bus service in Egypt to connect cities together.\n\nTo mark this milestone, the company also shared that the most popular time users requested Uber rides is 2 PM, and that Friday was the most popular day users requested rides.\n\nUberX emerged the most popular ride options among ride options such as Uber Moto, Uber Boda, and Uber Poa.The average trip time recorded on Uber is 24 minutes, and the longest recorded trip was over 492 km.The most popular drop-off destination is the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\n\u201cSince entering the market in 2013, we have created over 6 million economic opportunities in over 50 cities across SSA that we are present in,\u201d said Lorraine Onduru, the company\u2019s spokesperson and head of comms for East and West Africa, in a statement shared with TechCrunch.\n\nWithin the past year, Uber expanded to over 30 cities across its major markets: 21 in South Africa, 4 cities each in Kenya and Nigeria, and 2 in Ghana.\n\nAlongside its ride-hailing unit, it expanded UberEats across a few South African cities and Nairobi, Kenya. UberEats, which launched in 2016 in South Africa with just 1,000 restaurants, now serves over 8,000 merchants across 36 cities in South Africa and Kenya.\n\nDespite the success Uber has recorded in Africa, the ride-hailing company has also had to weather a few hurdles. Uber faces stiff competition from Bolt\u2014Uber\u2019s main competitor\u2014and other mobility tech companies.\n\nWhile Uber has focused on only operating in major cities across Africa, Bolt has taken the path of using an expansion strategy that\u2019s focused on not only operating in major cities across Africa but expanding to smaller cities and now operates in more African cities than Uber.\n\nUber has also had to deal with increasing its fare prices to cope with rising operating costs in Lagos and deal with backlash and lawsuits from unhappy drivers in Kenya.\n\nGlobally, in response to the downturn in the public markets, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said earlier this month that the company will now treat corporate hiring as a \u201cprivilege,\u201d hinting that Uber will freeze hiring or reduce its staff size. Khosrowshahi added that Uber will focus on achieving profitability on a free cash flow basis rather than adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA)\n\nIn its 2022 first-quarter earnings report, Uber reported a $5.9 billion loss despite revenue doubling to $6.9 billion from the same quarter last year. The losses were driven by a $5.6 billion headwind related to the company\u2019s equity investments, including unrealised losses related to Uber\u2019s stakes in Grab, Aurora, and Didi.\n\nDespite a bumpy first quarter, Uber expects to post \u201cmeaningful positive cash flows\u201d for the full-year 2022, which will be a first.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEver had to deal with fraud or a fraudulent person? Then the story of @Ade_authority \u2014 a tweeter \u2014 from March 2022 should be quite relatable, especially if you run a business.\n\nA customer has been ordering since 28th of February and been sending fake alert\n\n\n\nHe has ordered 4 different times , looking through the statement now, all fake alert amounting to 32000naira\n\n\n\nThe lesson from all of this is: Don\u2019t ever use zenith bank as your corporate account \u2014 Ade Authority (@Ade_authority) March 12, 2022\n\nOne of her customers had ordered ewa agoyin from her four times in under a month. Unfortunately, he sent fake debit alerts for each transaction, totalling \u20a632,000.\n\nLuckily, she recovered her money, but not everyone is that fortunate. And like these articles from The Guardian, Punch, and Vanguard show, these occurrences are not rare. Stories about fake credit alerts are the order of the day for many merchants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho will bell the cat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction\u2019s Success team\n\nUsually, for many of these merchants or small businesses, recovering this kind of money requires some blood and sweat and is a lengthy process, leading some to give up eventually.\n\nAnother angle to the problem is their inability to confirm whether these alerts are fake at first glance. So except they do a constant balancing of the books, or by some stroke of luck notice the discrepancy early enough as @Ade_authority did, they might not get their money back.\n\nAnd with more transactions done without physical interactions, finding the culprit could sometimes become like the proverbial needle in the haystack.\n\nTraction, a Nigeria-based fintech, thinks it can solve this problem using its proprietary solution.\n\nThe company provides an app that business owners can use to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables the merchant\u2019s employee\u2019s to confirm payments without having to call their employer.\n\nHowever, beyond this, Traction has a unique feature which helps merchants confirm that every alert is real. According to Seyi Xodus, Traction Apps Growth Marketing Manager, if the money hasn\u2019t been reflected on their platform, the alert is fake, or the money hasn\u2019t been sent.\n\nThe app gives users a virtual bank account powered by Providus Bank and can be used to make transfers and carry out other transactions.\n\nAccording to Xodus, \u201cWe are able to confirm that the alerts are genuine because we get notified directly from the virtual account custodian, which is Providus Bank. We only rely on the bank notification rather than a merchant\u2019s notification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe average wait time for an alert is ten seconds.\n\nWhat is the vision?\n\nMayowa Alli and Dolapo Adejuyigbe, Traction Apps Co-founders, met while working together at McKinsey & Company. Alli would later leave the company but return after a stint at Konga and completing his MBA at the Institut Europ\u00e9en d\u2019Administration des Affaires (INSEAD) in France.\n\nThough they would not found Traction until 2018, they had been having conversations regarding building something related for small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe had a passion for entrepreneurship, and we were always exchanging ideas of what to do,\u201d Adejuyigbe said.\n\nOne word that reverberated throughout the conversation was \u201cecosystem.\u201d A function, perhaps, of their years of consultancy with McKinsey and the learnings they got from other work experiences.\n\n\u201cMayowa and I were colleagues, and we used to work with a lot of banks. And everyone was trying to figure out how to really understand SMEs, but also how to provide optimal solutions for them. But the problem was that they couldn\u2019t fully understand that because a lot of SMEs are multi-banked and use different account numbers and platforms to run their business.\u201d\n\nSo they set out to build an ecosystem of products that covers the life cycle of how a business is run through three core levers: payments, lending, and retail management.\n\nWith payments, Traction currently provides Point of Sale (PoS) terminals for its merchants but also strongly leans towards offline payment options like Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and Quick Response (QR) codes, which Adejuyigbe says will be rolled out soon.\n\nTo help with network issues, Traction allows for offline reconciliation.\n\nIt also recently launched Cash Advance, its lending option which enables access to credit for customers who have been on the platform for two months. Repayment doesn\u2019t begin until a month after disbursement and is repaid through daily deductions.\n\nOn the retail management front, Traction is looking to provide inventory replenishment and management services to its users via partnerships.\n\n\u201cMerchants are going on the app or the web at least 20 times a day to confirm transactions. So there\u2019s that stickiness, and it now makes a lot of sense that if there\u2019s already that high level of activity and engagement, rather than other startups or platforms trying to build standalone platforms, they can essentially walk through Traction to do that. So that\u2019s essentially the super app proposition as well.\u201d\n\nEarning in percentages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Apps makes money off all of its verticals. So with payments, it ranges between 0.4 \u2013 0.5%. It also charges a 3% fee for lending and earns about 1-5% from customers using its software.\n\nCurrently, they are present in eight Nigerian states and serve big-name merchants like The Place, Bukka Hut, Pinkberry, Cold Stone, and Sweet Sensation, among others. However, most of their 19,000 customers \u2014 which they hope to grow to 200,000 in the next ten months \u2014 are what Adejuyigbe calls \u201cclassic merchants.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think one of the things that has been super exciting is we have built mainly for what we call our classic merchants \u2014 our guys who make an average of \u20a6400,000 to about \u20a62 million a month in transactions.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the team has grown from 9 to over 50 in two years, with most of these employees coming in through referrals and \u201csmart hiring,\u201d according to Adejuyigbe.\n\nPlaying in the same space as companies like Bamba, Biz301, and a host of old and newcomers should make for an interesting journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Pascal Ntsama, Co-Founder and CEO of Canza Finance got admitted to Georgia Southern University to study advanced mathematics, he had vague plans of becoming a rocket scientist.\n\nA year later, he transferred to Georgia Institute of Technology to study electrical and electronics engineering before going on to get a Masters in Computer/Information Technology and Management at Georgetown University.\n\nGetting into Georgia Tech was eye-opening, and had him working with students who had been around computers all their lives. To stay ahead, he had to work twice as hard. After learning of an opportunity to work with some professors as a researcher, he applied and got accepted, marking the beginning of his time in technology.\n\nAt Georgia Tech, he worked on cutting-edge technologies, including 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and electric vehicles, long before they became mainstream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduation, Ntsama went on to work at AT&T, where the same theme of working on early technologies continued. There he would meet Oyedeji Oluwoye, who was working on deploying fibre across parts of Asia.\n\nBoth immigrants (Oluwoye is a Nigerian and Ntsama is Cameroonian) often bounced ideas around boosting Internet penetration in Africa. Oluwoye, who had worked on cryptocurrencies while doing his Masters, also advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrencies, but he was not convinced.\n\nIn the meantime, the two started a business consulting for companies and governments worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe kind of work we did was we would send a document to organisations without being asked. For example, we found out that the Ministry of Communications in Cameroon wanted to build a data centre, so we created a research document that answered all their questions.\n\n\u201cOur thinking was \u2018we\u2019re a five-man team, so we can\u2019t go after big corporations, but if we do the work upfront, they might like us and give us a chance,\u2019\u201d Ntsama told Techpoint Africa over a call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nThey soon discovered it was not working, but Ntsama believes it gave them experience doing B2B outreach. In 2017, Oluwoye returned with the cryptocurrency gospel, only this time, he came with proof of his gains.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even talk. He just showed me his Ethereum wallet. I didn\u2019t argue with him, I just bought some Ethereum, and we started trading. We were not doing anything special; we just got in at a time when the market was doing well.\u201d\n\nSoon the duo began to think of cryptocurrency beyond trading and, in 2017, founded Coincentrix, receiving a grant from the Zcash Foundation the following year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoincentrix worked with organisations, including the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and a Brazilian company. The grant from the Zcash Foundation also helped them with outreaches to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\n\nSharing the motivation for focusing on HBCUs, Ntsama said, \u201cAs Africans, we always tend to be on the consumption end, meaning we\u2019re not involved when it\u2019s early on. When the innovation starts, we probably have doubts about it and only get involved when it gets mainstream.\n\n\u201cOne thing we were trying to do was speak to students early so that they can understand cryptocurrencies and how to build solutions around it.\u201d\n\nThe road not taken\n\nOn Tuesday, July 27, 2021, Godwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), announced an end to forex sales to bureau de change (BDC) operators.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWe have noted with disappointment and great concern that our bureau de change operators have abandoned the original objective of their establishment, which was to serve retail end users who need $5,000 or less. Instead, they have become (illegal) wholesale dealers in foreign exchange to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\u201d\n\nTwo years earlier, in 2019, Ntsama and Oluwoye had stumbled on the BDC operators while researching the nature of financial transactions in Nigeria and Cameroon. Fascinated by their operations, they decided to build their new startup, Canza Finance, around this group.\n\nTo understand what informed their decision, I\u2019ll paint a picture of how BDCs in Nigeria operate.\n\nAs an import-dependent country, Nigerian businesses often have to make payments for products they get from outside the country. Sourcing foreign exchange for doing this is, however, complicated. On the other hand, individuals need forex to pay for goods and services abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial banks in the country allocate personal travel allowance (PTA) and business travel allowance (BTA) every quarter. In most cases, this does not cover the cost of sourcing goods or paying for services for many people. Consequently, they need alternative sources of foreign exchange, which is where the BDCs come in.\n\nThey source for foreign exchange through remittances, local businesses, and the previously mentioned CBN allocations, which they provide to businesses and individuals who cannot get any through official channels. As such, they are an integral part of the Nigerian financial system.\n\nHowever, even after getting foreign exchange from the BDCs, settling cross-border business transactions often takes some time, a problem solved by using cryptocurrencies. Recognising this, Ntsama and Oluwoye decided to leverage their reach to provide a faster way for businesses and individuals to make payments.\n\nUsing third-party partners, the company can receive stablecoins from businesses or individuals to facilitate payments. Agents who make these transactions happen are paid in cryptocurrencies or cash, depending on their preference.\n\nHere\u2019s a possible scenario: Emeka sells laptops and computer accessories which he gets from China to businesses in Nigeria. He typically gets shipments of $100,000, but since his bank can only provide him with $10,000 for overseas payments, he has to use the BDC operators to make up the difference.\n\nUsually, these operators have networks that extend beyond the country, so they also help businesses make payments to their foreign partners. Canza Finance\u2019s role here is to substitute the dollar, for example, with a stablecoin, thus ensuring that businesses can make payments almost instantly rather than wait a few days.\n\nCross-border payments are not all the company does, as it also enables payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. It plans to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nFor Canza Finance\u2019s local P2P offering, a user simply places a buy or sell order on the USSD app, which Canza Finance routes to the closest FX agent. The user then meets up with the agent where they receive or deposit cash, depending on the type of transaction. The same applies to its local payment service.\n\nUsing cash when most fintech companies and even the CBN are pushing for a cashless economy may sound counterintuitive. Still, with CBN regulations prohibiting commercial banks from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions, this is the easiest way to stay in line with the regulation.\n\nInitially, the company planned to focus on its B2C vertical, but growing interest from B2B customers has necessitated a shift. Yet, Ntsama hopes the company will serve more B2C customers soon.\n\nLike most financial services institutions, Canza Finance makes money by charging users a transaction fee which Ntsama says is not more than 2% of the transaction value. This also applies to its treasury and asset management services which the startup has not yet launched.\n\nStanding out from the pack\n\nWhile the blockchain industry is relatively nascent in Africa, startups such as Lazerpay and Hellicarrier have sprung up to solve problems in the financial services industry. As a result, it could be difficult to understand how these companies differ, but Ntsama believes Canza Finance\u2019s use of the BDC operators makes it different from existing players.\n\n\u201cI would say what makes us different is that we decided to build based on natural behaviours. We have built around the FX agents because we understand that they have an important position in the financial structure of the continent, and it\u2019s most likely not going to fade away anytime soon; it\u2019s probably going to be the reason we succeed.\u201d\n\nUsing BDC operators is not the only differentiating factor Ntsama sees. He believes that Canza Finance\u2019s suite of products is an advantage rather than a distraction as they are all connected.\n\n\u201cMost startups would focus on one thing and provide one solution for that thing, but we\u2019re a company of companies which is very unusual for a startup.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith the African population expected to reach nearly 2.5 billion by 2050, Ntsama believes there is much room for growth. Presently, the startup predominantly operates in Nigeria. However, it facilitates cross-border payments to other countries and plans to move into Francophone Africa once it gets a good grip on the Nigerian market.\n\nBuilding a startup that facilitates transactions using cryptocurrencies comes with unique challenges, especially in Nigeria, where the Central Bank does not necessarily encourage it. However, Ntsama shares that the company is heavily investing in a legal and advisory team to ensure it is always on the right side of the law.\n\n\u201cWe have a whole legal and compliance strategy created by a legal advisory board of experts in the legal space and financial services. This will help us with our business structuring, and we can still do business without falling into issues with regulators.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Ntsama says their biggest challenge has been turning down money from businesses because they could not facilitate huge transactions. According to Ntsama, Canza has served 39 businesses and has a network of 203 FX agents across Nigeria.\n\nHaving closed a $3.27 million seed round led by Fenbushi Capital with participation from Dominance Ventures, Hashkey Capital, Boxing Ventures, Consensys, and Protocol Labs, the startup plans to improve its product and grow its team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

On this day, many African countries commemorate their hard-won liberation from European colonial powers.\n\nA little history: Formerly known as African Freedom Day, it was established on April 15, 1958, in Ghana. And between 1958 and 1963, the African and global nation-class struggle intensified.\n\nDuring this time, 17 African countries gained independence, and 1960 was declared the Year of Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 25, 1963, 31 African leaders met at a summit to form the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). They changed the name of Africa Freedom Day to \u201cAfrican Liberation Day\u201d and moved the date to May 25.\n\nBesides, countries like Ghana, Kenya, Spain, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the United States celebrate this day.\n\nSo, today, let us remember the struggles for liberation and development while we continue to raise political awareness globally.\n\nWell, here\u2019s today\u2019s outline:\n\nShaping the African mobility narrative\n\nFoondaMate\u2019s $2 million funding\n\nTwitter Create\n\nAMP\u2019s $5.6 million seed\n\nShaping the African mobility narrative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 will always be known as the calm before the storm that was the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it was also the year that we began to see what seemed like an avalanche of apps that helped you move from point A to B.\n\nConsequently, companies like GIG Mobility, Max.ng, and Gokada dominated the mobility space, and pan-African players like Safeboda soon followed.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s mobility companies have had varying successes, there are important factors that are currently unaddressed in the sector; cracks that are currently being covered up with technology.\n\nSo, major players in Africa\u2019s mobility space, led by mobility behemoth, GIG Mobility, are preparing to hold critical conversations about this. This inaugural event will take place on June 2, 2021, with the theme: Pathways to the Future of Mobility in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the theme triggered some questions in me. First and foremost, are mobility players currently trying to change the narrative? If you ask me, I\u2019ll respond in the negative. But this is not about me.\n\nThe newly appointed CEO of GIG mobility, Enahoro Okhae, said, \u201cJust stepping into the mobility space, I realised the players in the space are not trying to shape the narrative.\u201d\n\nHence, the need to \u201chave several important discourses across different spheres for the industry to be stabilised.\u201d Now, the question is, how can they shape the mobility narrative?\n\nIf you want to know how, please read this story: How companies can shape the narrative for tech-enabled mobility in Africa\n\nFoondaMate\u2019s $2 million funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoondaMate co-founders from L-R: (Tao Boyle, Dacod Magagula); Source: Supplied\n\nLast year, Techpoint Africa featured FoondaMate, a South African edtech startup that helps students study using WhatsApp.\n\nHow? The WhatsApp API helps students download research papers, search concepts, define words, and perform simple mathematical calculations.\n\nAlso, it assists educators in assigning and posting homework to students and sharing other learning materials with them through its integrated resources.\n\nWhy WhatsApp? In South Africa, Whatsapp is widely used and cheaper or free to use. Further, the company claims that its learning chatbot is simple to use, inexpensive, and serves as a more organised alternative to using search engines for study.\n\nSo, yesterday, Tuesday, May 24, 2022, the startup announced that it had raised $2 million in seed funding to accelerate the global adoption of its Whatsapp and Facebook-based learning chatbot.\n\nLocalGlobe led the funding, with participation from Emerge Education, Odunayo Eweniyi via FirstCheckAfrica, Iyin Aboyeji via Future Africa, and LoftyInc, and angels from Luno (Marcus Swanepoel) and Justworks (Isaac Oates).\n\nFurther, the company says that it is currently working on localising its learning material to accommodate learners in more countries and propel the platform\u2019s growth to more than 50 million users.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s first interest rate hike in six years will increase the borrowing costs of businesses in the short-term and may fail to address surging inflation in isolation.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on Tuesday, joined global central banks in raising benchmark interest rates to curtail rising inflation and stimulate foreign portfolio inflows (FPI).\n\nThe rate was raised by 150 basis points to 13 percent.\n\nThe implication of this is that the cost of borrowing by businesses, from manufacturers to small and medium-scale firms, will increase as banks reprice their assets and loans, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cWhat the recent rate hike means for the economy is that the cost of credit to the few beneficiaries of the bank credits will increase which will impact their operating costs, prices of their products and profit margins,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, founder/CEO of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, an economic and business advocacy think tank.\n\n\u201cInvestors in fixed income instruments may also benefit from the hike. However, there would be some adverse effects on the equities market,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe decision to hike rates, which was unanimously taken by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) after a two-day meeting in Abuja, was targeted at curtailing rising inflation and to support the output growth, Godwin Emefiele, governor of CBN, said.\n\nThe apex bank retained the asymmetric corridor around the MPR at +100 /-700 basis points, Cash Reserve Ratio at 27.4 percent, and Liquidity Ratio at 30 percent.\n\nThe rate hike, which caught some analysts by surprise, may not have the desired impact on inflation but will definitely increase the cost of capital of businesses, according to Taiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC.\n\n\u201cGiven that inflation in Nigeria is largely driven from the supply side rather than excess money supply, the impact of the rate hike in pushing down inflation may be marginal while it could have more impact on growth,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\n\u201cCost of capital will rise, thereby putting more pressure on the margins of businesses and their ability to expand. This is also likely to increase the debt service cost of government,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inflation rate jumped to 16.82 percent in April, the highest in eight months amid rising food and diesel prices.\n\nOn his part, Tope Fasua, CEO of Global Analytics, said the rate hike would slow down economic growth. He said manufacturers and producers would come for CBN\u2019s neck because banks would hike borrowing rates, adding that the attempt was to slow down inflation but it may also be ineffective because of weak transmission mechanisms in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn nearby Ghana, consistent hikes in their policy rates to about 19 percent have not slowed down inflation which is in the mid 20 percent. Sub-Saharan African economies must be managed with different thinking, else we continue to sink into despair. Taken together with what\u2019s happening on the global scene perhaps, this is the onset of another global recession,\u201d Fasua said.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, MD/chief business officer, Optimus by Afrinvest, said: \u201cThe rate hike is a surprise, especially with the magnitude and a major drift from the previous stance of the CBN.\n\n\u201cRaising MPR will not necessarily translate into increased FPIs due to the FX challenges. This will lead to high cost of borrowing for firms and the government. As a result, it would lead to higher cost of production and higher inflation rate,\u201d he said.\n\nAyodele Akinwunmi, relationship manager, corporate banking at FSDH Merchant Bank Limited, said: \u201cI think it is a necessary decision the MPC needs to make at this point, given happenings around the world and the rising inflation rate in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said although fragile, the economy seemed to be on a path of growth, given the Q1 2022 GDP figures released this week.\n\n\u201cHowever, the rising inflation rate needs some policy attention now so that it is not growth retarding,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: For first time in six years, CBN hikes rate to 13%\n\nAccording to Akinwunmi, the rising yields and interest rate hikes in other advanced economics may likely have negative impact on the Nigerian economy, both on the exchange rate and inflation rate if nothing is done now.\n\n\u201cPressure on the exchange rate by maintaining a policy regime that is not in tune with reality, given the global economic environment, will cause problems for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe increase in the CBN\u2019s benchmark interest rate will mean that banks will begin to reprice their assets and have broader investment opportunities according to analysts.\n\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of interest rate hike globally tend to be the banks because the banks do better when interest rates are high,\u201d Nnamdi Nwizu, co-managing partner/head of trading at Comercio Partners Limited, said.\n\nAccording to him, it gives the banks high opportunity to raise their interest rates on loans, and also government securities most probably will start to move up, which naturally will give banks the opportunity to invest much higher level than they were now.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Treasury bill rate is trading at 5 percent and we expect that with this hike and possibly more hikes in the future, we will see those rates move up which naturally will give banks broader investment outlets,\u201d Nwizu said.\n\nLooking at it from the growth aspect, Bismarck Rewane, managing director of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, said: \u201cYou will see some manufacturers who have built capacity two to three years ago in the brewing and cement space take advantage of growth but my biggest fear is that there may be a need to look at the wages again.\n\n\u201cWhat can Nigeria do to adjust wage structure to make it competitive and not actually fuel inflation? This is a practical example of what is called a monetary policy trilemma and that is where we are,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRiding on the back of Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s investment drive, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Zenith Bank, Suntrust Bank, among other investors have made commitments to the development of a 1,590-hectare oil palm plantation operated by Raedial Farms Limited.\n\nWith the global demand for oil palm on the increase amid supply disruptions, investors are taking advantage of the Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP), to deepen imprints in the country\u2019s oil palm sector. Already, Edo has about 120,000 hectares of oil palm plantation under development.\n\nOther investors and stakeholders who visited the Raedial Farms facility in Iguomokhua village, Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State include Boston Advisory, CAGL Global, United Capital & United Bank of Africa (UBA). They were received by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Uwadiale Agenmonmen.\n\nAgenmonmen said work is in top gear to supply crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) to the market through the current expansion programme of its palm plantation and mill.\n\nHe stated that there was no better time to invest in palm oil cultivation and production in Nigeria other than now, particularly against the backdrop of the recent ban on the exportation of palm oil and oil palm produced by the Indonesian government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe business environment is interesting. There may be ups and downs but lately, the palm oil value chain has been the best in a while, fostered by Indonesia shutting down their export recently and thereby putting the pressure back home.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, people that normally import can no longer import palm oil and other products from Indonesia. So, the prices are going up and it is good for the farmers that actually cultivate and sell. In a nutshell, right now, the business environment is okay.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the financial support towards the growth of the industry, he stated that the major obstacle militating the success of farmers in the oil palm industry is largely occasioned by the set of conditions or evaluation commercial banks give to those who want to access the funds provided by CBN.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe farm sits on 1,509 hectares of land and has currently cultivated 700 hectares while another 500 hectares would be cultivated this year. The oil mill in the farm currently has the capacity of producing 16 tons of red oil every day and from palm kernel oil, it can produce 27 tons every day when there is a full stock of raw materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to bring our current investors and bankers here to physically see what we are doing because there is a difference when you talk to people about what you do on paper and phone calls. We want them to feel connected to where they have their money and with this, we look forward to better business opportunities.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He noted that working together with other stakeholders, including all security agencies, the government will ensure a safe and conducive environment for people to live and do business without harassment and extortion.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have declared a complete war on land grabbers in the state. With the support of the Inspector General of Police, we are building trucks with guns and a barrack that will contain 100 men. We are working with the Private Property Protection Committee to come up with a list of petitions which is about 420. We will address all and ensure we end land grabbing in the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor further added, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in the way we have gone in the past, where people build indiscriminately in the state, blocking waterways and causing erosion across the state. We want to create a culture of planning. We owe it to the people to set a path to the future of the state. It\u2019s on us to build the system and the people to own it, long after we leave office.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted that the stakeholders\u2019 meeting is important because of the role of the Christian Community in driving development in the state.\n\nHe urged, \u201cChurches must join us to correct the ills going on today and we need to start reordering the planning of the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chairman of PFN in Edo State, Evang.

We are ready to submit our building plans but appeal to the governor to approve such plans.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of Edo CAN, Bishop Oyenude Kure promised the support of Christians to ensure sustainable development in the state.\n\nOn her part, Commissioner for Physical Planning, Urban and Regional Development, Isoken Omo, noted, \u201cCAN is important to the project as the state knows you are a key influencer within the state and beyond.

We have been able to grow our economy to align with its potential. We are addressing a whole lot of issues, particularly security and healthcare to sort out the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working to fire our economy to the extent that we utilize the economy to the benefit of our people, and one key driver for us is agriculture; food. The number one pressing issue in Nigeria today is food availability.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure we focus on food production and economic growth. We are engaging with our young people and trying to position them to take advantage of the opportunities in culture and technology globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to be competitive economically, the key asset you need are your people; the key driver they need is education. They have to be educated. We are emphasizing education, particularly basic education,\u201d he added.\n\nReaffirming his government\u2019s commitment to ending the menace of human trafficking and illegal migration in Edo, Obaseki further noted, \u201cWe realized that it is that lack of hope and poor education that fuels irregular migration, and we have tried as much as we can to curtail that menace of irregular migration by creating hope for them; nobody wants to leave home if the home is comfortable.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the success recorded by his administration in the health sector, the governor said the state partnered with the Association of Nigeria Physicians in the Americas (ANPA) to provide free medical outreach to Edo people.\n\nHe said, \u201cA couple of weeks ago, we received 67 medical practitioners in our state and they worked with our personnel on ground to improve quality healthcare delivery to our people. For us, with healthcare, it\u2019s about the foundation. If we have the basic health footprint right, as well as the training of community healthcare heads, then it will not be too challenging dealing with diseases such as malaria and distributing vaccines.\u201d\n\nOn culture, Obaseki added, \u201cFor us as government, our goal is to position Edo for the subcontinent. We are working with the European Government in the areas of storage and preservation facilities and the Nigeria Government, to strengthen the national museum monuments\u2019 facilities.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with the Royal Palace in building a royal collection and the whole idea is to build the Edo Museum of West Africa Art (EMOWAA) where you will have a lot to see when you come in.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her speech, the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard, saluted the government for its anti-trafficking laws, noting that they have helped in curbing irregular migration among young people in the state.\n\nWhile reassuring the support of the United States, she further hailed the Obaseki-led government for its various programmes to positively engage Edo youths.\n\nLeonard further revealed that museums in the United States of America are intensifying efforts to repatriate Benin artifacts in their possession.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nEkiti State governor and the chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has expressed support for the second term bid of Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun State.\n\nFayemi lauded Oyetola\u2019s rich understanding of governance and progressive ideologies, saying he has shown unusual capacity to keep the state afloat amid depressed economy.\n\nHe said Oyetola\u2019s stand-out performance despite \u201cnon-existent\u201d resources has continued to raise admiration in different leadership quarters.\n\nFayemi stated this in Osogbo during his consultation with the party faithful in Osun.\n\nHe harped on unity in the South-West region, saying whatever could stand in the way of the region\u2019s collective success must be firmly resisted.\n\n\u201cI must immensely thank the governor for his generosity of spirit and constant solidarity from the very beginning, even when I was not governor. Whatever little it appears I have contributed in Osun does not come anywhere close to what Governor Oyetola has done for me.\n\n\u201cIt is only right that I come to Osun because those who know me know that it\u2019s one Fayemi, one Oyetola.\n\n\u201cI am unapologetically committed to his success in this state, and that is how it should be because he has always, consistently supported me, in sadness and in joy. So, you will see me in full colour here very soon.\n\n\u201cIn the last election, even when things were a bit funny, we were here to do the needful and God gave us victory. That victory will be replicated by God\u2019s grace.\n\n\u201cThis man is our leading light. He has done magic in this state. Many may not know, but I know because I\u2019m chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, and I know what comes to this state in terms of revenue. But what I don\u2019t know is how he has managed non-existent resources.\n\n\u201cHe is not only a financial engineer but a financial surgeon. He has gone ahead to fix the things that put us in problems in the past, the things we were not doing that caused us problems. He did them out of nothing. So, there is no way you will not look up to such a man who is given to service.\n\n\u201cSo, for me, it is an immense pleasure and honour to be associated with Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the purpose of his visit, Fayemi urged the delegates in Osun to exercise unity of purpose in supporting South-West agenda, saying that victory for one is victory for all.\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor me, the victory of South-West means that we are all victorious, because there is no aspirant from the zone who is not eminently qualified. Our values have remained constant and we are leaders in the progressive movement.\n\n\u201cWe are driven by the same beliefs; we are driven by the same passion; we are driven by the same commitment to improve the condition of our people. That is what is driving whatever we are doing.\n\n\u201cI have not come with any sense of entitlement. I have only come to make an appeal. And it is important to dispel any insinuation that there is one big battle going on among us. This is not true, as a matter of fact, I told Asiwaju that I am coming here today. So, people should be careful not to inherit non-existent enemies. What is important is the progress of our people and the success of the South-West.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be any risk to the success of the South-West, I want to assure you that there will be a collective resolve. We are specially endowed to help our people and make a difference in Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola lauded Governor Fayemi for his support over the years, adding \u201cI am elated to welcome my dear brother to our State. We have been brothers for several years before now. Our journey of brotherhood didn\u2019t start from politics. It has been over 30 years of brotherhood. He has also been there for me at any point of my need and he has always been consistent.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of what is happening is the fact that Southwest has brilliant aspirants to showcase. It shows that we have the best for the contest.\n\n\u201cAs you could see, this gathering is a mixture of who is who in our party, most importantly the members of the State Working Committee, Party Elders, Igbimo Agba, delegates among others. They are here because they know you are our brother and they know you are their own.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will grant your heart desires and by God\u2019s grace, southwest will produce the presidential candidate of our party\u201d, Oyetola said.",

          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nThe political trajectory of Nigeria in the next four years will be initialised this Saturday \u2013 as the two leading political parties (the APC and the PDP) select candidates for the 2023 presidential election. The fate our nation rests in the whimsical repository of a few deciders. We can divine the future possibilities and challenges of our country from the outcome of these presidential primaries. It is a make-or-mar fixture.\n\nNigeria is at a precarious time in its evolution. As I wrote in a previous column, Nigeria\u2019s next president will be coming at a time the country is agonisingly sundered along ethnic and religious contours; at a time of seething anger and great uncertainty; when the economy is in shreds; corruption at the apogee; at such a perilous time when Nigerians cannot commute from one part of the country to another for fear of being killed and kidnapped; at such a vulnerable time when a dollar is N600 at the parallel market, and when over 13 million children are out of school. Nigeria\u2019s next president will be coming at a time of anomie.\n\nThe task ahead is enormous. Nigeria desperately needs the right people to get the right fixes. A president who will address the hydra of insurgency, banditry and kidnapping; galloping debts, oil revenue shrinkage, freewheeling inflation, and the Venus flytrap called petrol subsidy. These are tasks demanding extraordinary competence and a surfeit of courage.\n\nCleaving substance from blanks in the APC, Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos; Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti; Rotimi Amaechi, former minister of transportation, and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo are the presidential probables.\n\nTinubu is perhaps the most popular presidential hopeful in the APC. I think in Tinubu resides the gravitas to take tough decisions. Nigeria needs a president who is not afraid to be unpopular. Taking critical and tough decisions comes with revulsion and even violent opposition from segments of society. But Nigeria cannot achieve its manifest destiny without some hard scrubs. Tinubu comes off as that leader who is not disinclined to dare the undared. He is feisty, deliberate and unbending.\n\nTinubu may not be the favourite of the APC umpires, but he has support across the states, particularly in the north-west and in a section of the south-west. If he goes through with the primaries, he could pull a summer surprise. However, party insiders say he may not breast the tape. They say he could yield his bid to Fayemi who may eventually become the standard-bearer.\n\nFayemi is a presidential specimen. He has copious understanding of governance and economy; he is a thinker who could become Nigeria\u2019s first philosopher president. Being the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, he has composite knowledge of the problems gnawing at the heart of the federating units.\n\nBut he is not very popular within the APC and the delegates. His political fate may be star-crossed as it is tied to the whim of Tinubu. If Tinubu capitulates to pressure and decides to retrieve his gauntlet, Fayemi stands a fantastic chance of becoming the party\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nAmaechi, the lion of Ubima, is the most resilient of all the presidential hopefuls in the APC. He resigned his appointment as minister to trudge through an undulating and serpentine path. He makes the politically impossible seem plausible. He is the earl of possibilities; a fighter and believer. He has visited most of the states, seeking the support of APC delegates. Some of the governors and APC stakeholders have publicly declared their support for him. In Plateau state, Simon Lalong, the governor, said: \u201cYou are the first presidential aspirant to come and see us, when I invited others to come, they said they can\u2019t come to Plateau because it would be a waste of time because Plateau people will not vote for them, but will vote for Amaechi. So, you didn\u2019t need to talk much. We want to rely on somebody that has done it before. We are telling you so that you would not waste your time to come back for campaigns. We have taken our decision. You have done a lot for our people.\u2019\u2019\n\nMuhammad Badaru, governor of Jigawa, also endorsed Amaechi for the APC presidential ticket. He said \u2018\u2019it\u2019s either you or me\u2019\u2019. While Amaechi will win some states in the presidential primaries, he may need more than that to become victorious. He needs Buhari\u2019s imprimatur. He needs the president\u2019s endorsement to sail plainly through the primaries. Buhari\u2019s endorsement will seal it for Amaechi.\n\nThere are a few presidential jokers in the APC like Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Badaru who have been put on ice pending the outcome of the PDP presidential primaries \u2013 whether it swings north or south. The presidential probables in the party are Tinubu, Fayemi, Amaechi and Osinbajo.\n\nOther presidential hopefuls in the party like Ogbonnaya Onu and Emeka Nwajiuba are pinning their hopes on Buhari\u2019s endorsement to clinch the ticket.\n\nIn the PDP, the contest is clearly between Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, and Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers. It is a clash of cash. The bigger spender wins. But most party stakeholders are favourably disposed towards Atiku\u2019s candidature. Wike is considered uncouth, temperamental and too highhanded to be president.\n\nMay the best candidates emerge.\n\n-By Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "text": "Wema Bank Plc, one of Nigeria\u2019s troubled financial institutions, is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons, as some of its clients accuse the lender of engaging in unlawful banking practices in the country.\n\nThey claimed they discovered the bank and its agents had been establishing unauthorised accounts for customers using information or data held by the bank.\n\nIn order to commemorate its 5th anniversary, the financial institution, run by Ademola Adebise, is accused of establishing accounts for some Nigerians on its digital banking platform, ALAT, without their knowledge or agreement.\n\nWhile the actual number of unauthorised accounts opened on behalf of unsuspecting Nigerians is unknown, Wema Bank was aiming to achieve \u201ca million account in one day\u201d.\n\nWema Bank, in a mail claimed the unauthorised accounts were opened for certain persons \u201cto celebrate with us\u201d despite not informing them ahead or receiving approval to create the accounts.\n\nThis illegal banking practice is similar to that of Wells Fargo, a United State bank, which was accused of opening 1.5 million accounts without authorisation, with over 565,000 credit cards applied for, allegedly without customers consent.\n\nAbout 5,300 employees at Wells Fargo were sacked for opening the illegal accounts, and the company was fined $185 million by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the United States.\n\nThe unauthorised Wells Fargo accounts were only uncovered by the affected persons when the accounts started accumulating debt from bank charges on the unsuspecting individuals.\n\nJust as the sacked Wells Fargo employees were said to have indulged in fraudulently opening sham accounts to beat target, Wema Bank vendors and marketers may have used the same strategy to achieve the lender\u2019s anniversary target.\n\nThat of Wema Bank is expected to also place a financial burden on the unsuspecting persons through account maintenance cost, from which the lender generated about N2.10 million last year, surpassing N1.24 million of 2020.\n\nRecently, Mental Health Advocate, Adebayo Tayo, took to his Twitter account to publicly accuse Wema Bank of opening an account in his name without authorisation from him.\n\nTayo lamented that he never knew he had a new Wema Bank account until his mother contacted him, because she received an alert that was intended for him \u2013 shocking, how come he owns an account he\u2019s unaware of, and his mom receives the alert.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about how my info had been used by Wema Bank and I need detailed explanations about the account including every transactions it has performed before someone uses my details for an account to launder money or collect ransome, he stated.\n\nFollowing a probe into Tayo\u2019s claim, this newspaper discovered he was not the only one whose identity was used by the financial institution, to open accounts on its digital banking platform, ALAT, without the knowledge or consent of the individuals.\n\nAnother affected Nigerian is Oyenike Ojo, whose name was used to open an account. However, when money was sent to the account, the alert details showed another name, Oluseyi Bamgboyi as account owner \u2013 which means two different names seem to have been used to open one account.\n\nOjo\u2019s husband said something was shady about the account, \u201cWhat I said is, the current name on the account number in my screenshots is not my wife\u2019s name. If you look at that screenshot, the account was opened with my wife\u2019s name and a new account number.\n\n\u201cShe also got a credit alert notification via sms with the new account number. This shows that her details were used to open that account. However I tried to do a transfer to that account this morning when I read the news only to see that the account name is Oluseyi Bamgboye and not Oyenike Ojo (which is my wife\u2019s name). Something is definitely fishy\u201d, he explained to Ripples Nigeria.\n\nOjo said his wife has an account with Wema Bank which she hasn\u2019t used for about seven years, and the new account created in her name doesn\u2019t seem to carry the same number with her old account.\n\nHe stressed that the unauthorized accounts opened is \u201cdefinitely an inside job.\u201d, stating , \u201cCustomer\u2019s details are compromised and they are being used to open new accounts. Whether by marketers so as to meet targets of number of accounts opened, or for money laundering, I can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\nOjo asked for an investigation into the illegal accounts opened by Wema Bank, saying the situation is questionable, \u201cHow Oyenike Ojo\u2019s savings account opened without her permission has now become Oluseyi Bamgboye\u2019s account is definitely questionable.\u201d Ojo said, expressing his worry.\n\nAnother name used to open unauthorized account, Abimbola Fakoyejo, disclosed that he was still wondering about his unused account on ALAT, when he saw a message notifying him that an account has been opened in his name.\n\nWema Bank also did not immediately respond to our enquiry on the matter.

          "text": "Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has expressed his readiness to support incumbent Governor of Osun and Candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the State, Adegboyega Oyetola, to ensure his success, especially in the July 16 governorship election.\n\nFayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, lauded Oyetola\u2019s rich understanding of governance and progressive ideologies, saying he has shown unusual capacity to keep the state afloat amid depressed economy.\n\nHe said Oyetola\u2019s stand-out performance despite \u201cnon-existent\u201d resources has continued to raise admiration in different leadership quarters.\n\nFayemi stated this in Osogbo during his consultation with the party faithful in Osun.\n\nHe harped on unity in the South-West region, saying whatever could stand in the way of the region\u2019s collective success must be firmly resisted.\n\n\u201cI must immensely thank the governor for his generosity of spirit and constant solidarity from the very beginning, even when I was not governor. Whatever little it appears I have contributed in Osun does not come anywhere close to what Governor Oyetola has done for me.\n\n\u201cIt is only right that I come to Osun because those who know me know that it\u2019s one Fayemi, one Oyetola.\n\n\u201cI am unapologetically committed to his success in this state, and that is how it should be because he has always, consistently supported me, in sadness and in joy. So, you will see me in full colour here very soon.\n\n\u201cIn the last election, even when things were a bit funny, we were here to do the needful and God gave us victory. That victory will be replicated by God\u2019s grace.\n\n\u201cThis man is our leading light. He has done magic in this state. Many may not know, but I know because I\u2019m chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, and I know what comes to this state in terms of revenue. But what I don\u2019t know is how he has managed non-existent resources.\n\n\u201cHe is not only a financial engineer but a financial surgeon. He has gone ahead to fix the things that put us in problems in the past, the things we were not doing that caused us problems. He did them out of nothing. So, there is no way you will not look up to such a man who is given to service.\n\n\u201cSo, for me, it is an immense pleasure and honour to be associated with Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the purpose of his visit, Fayemi urged the delegates in Osun to exercise unity of purpose in supporting South-West agenda, saying that victory for one is victory for all.\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor me, the victory of South-West means that we are all victorious, because there is no aspirant from the zone who is not eminently qualified. Our values have remained constant and we are leaders in the progressive movement.\n\n\u201cWe are driven by the same beliefs; we are driven by the same passion; we are driven by the same commitment to improve the condition of our people. That is what is driving whatever we are doing.\n\n\u201cI have not come with any sense of entitlement. I have only come to make an appeal. And it is important to dispel any insinuation that there is one big battle going on among us. This is not true, as a matter of fact, I told Asiwaju that I am coming here today. So, people should be careful not to inherit non-existent enemies. What is important is the progress of our people and the success of the South-West.\n\n\u201cIf there is going to be any risk to the success of the South-West, I want to assure you that there will be a collective resolve. We are specially endowed to help our people and make a difference in Nigeria\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola lauded Governor Fayemi for his support over the years, adding \u201cI am elated to welcome my dear brother to our State. We have been brothers for several years before now. Our journey of brotherhood didn\u2019t start from politics. It has been over 30 years of brotherhood. He has also been there for me at any point of my need and he has always been consistent.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of what is happening is the fact that Southwest has brilliant aspirants to showcase. It shows that we have the best for the contest.\n\n\u201cAs you could see, this gathering is a mixture of who is who in our party, most importantly the members of the State Working Committee, Party Elders, Igbimo Agba, delegates among others. They are here because they know you are our brother and they know you are their own.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will grant your heart desires and by God\u2019s grace, southwest will produce the presidential candidate of our party\u201d, Oyetola said.",

          "title": "Presidential ticket: APC national chairman, Adamu, breaks silence on consensus arrangement",
          "text": "Ahead of the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential primaries scheduled for Sunday, the party\u2019s leadership Wednesday said consensus arrangement on its choice candidate is not on the table for now.\n\nAPC National Chairman Senator Abdullah Adamu revealed this while speaking to some select journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe party leader, who reiterated his commitment to ensuring level\n\nEchoes of consensus\n\nThere have been some calls for consensus by some APC stakeholders to pick its presidential candidate.\n\nSpecifically, there were permutations by party faithful that the leadership at the national level would galvanise the 25 APC aspirants to forge a consensus in the same manner they did during their last national convention to elect party executives.\n\nFor instance, seven South-east presidential aspirants on the party\u2019s platform resolved last Sunday to support any aspirant from the region who gets the parties ticket for the 2023 general election.\n\nAlso, two presidential aspirants namely former Speaker House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole and former Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba also lent their voices for a consensus arrangement.\n\nOn the contrary, however, No Alternative To Tunubu 2023 (NATT2023) \u2013 a support group of APC national leader and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, kicked against consensus arrangement, saying it put limits to several available choices.\n\nBut the APC consensus became necessary against the backdrop that the PDP, the major opposition party, had thrown its presidential race open to all the regions of the country.\n\nThe consensus if formed would help nip in the bud the rancorous and acrimonious situation likely to arise in the aftermath of the party primaries.\n\nParty\u2019s stand\n\nBut speaking in an interview Wednesday at the party\u2019s national secretariat, the APC national chairman, Senator Adamu, said \u201cthe party has its own rules and strategies, which I will not expose now. What I can say for now is, all the aspirants would be assessed to measure their competence during the primary.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cit is normal that you can\u2019t stop many people from aspiring for a position, and it is ecstatic for us that they are aspiring for the position under the platform of our great party. We thank God, we also thank them. Aspiring for a political position is not an offense, but victory is the will of God. Everybody can contest, but you should know that, when God chooses the winner, those who are faithful to God, will succumb and even work for the final victor.\n\n\u201cSo, what I want to point out here is, even a mad man knows that twenty eight aspirants cannot be president at the same time. Only one will! Therefore, what we can do as the leaders of the party, is to be just to all of them. We know that we are not saints, we are not perfect, but we pray for God to help us do justice to everybody.\u201d\n\nWhen further pressed on whether at the party level, they would have any arrangement to produce a \u2018unity candidate\u2019 as it happened during election of party executives last March, 2022, he said: \u201cContesting for the position of a party chairman or any party executive position is not the same as the position of the president. The enthusiasm and desire to acquire the position of a party chairman is not as strong as that of a president\u2019s seat. It is incomparable!\u201d\n\nLawal halts consultation\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has put off all his political engagements for Wednesday to mourn the farmers killed by the terrorists in Borno state Sunday.\n\nMore than 50 farmers were reportedly killed at the outskirts of Kala Balge local government area by terrorists suspected to be Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nLawan had already scheduled some engagements for Wednesday one of which was to meet with the APC leaders and delegates in Borno state.\n\nHe was also scheduled to proceed from Maiduguri to Gombe also to meet party leaders and particularly, the delegates to canvas support for his presidential bid ahead of the upcoming primaries but decided to put off all his political engagements for the day on account of the tragic incident and instead proceeded to Maiduguri only on a condolence visit.\n\nWhile in Maiduguri, the Senate President met with Governor Babagana Umara Zulum and the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai to commiserate with the government and people of Borno state.\n\nAt the Palace of Shehu of Borno, Lawan said: \u201cWe are in Maiduguri for a very solemn event. We had wanted to come to meet with the delegates in continuation of the campaign for the flag of our Party, the APC, for the Presidential race.\n\n\u201cBecause of the sad event that took place in Kala Balge where over 50 of our people were killed, we felt that it was only appropriate to come to Borno to condole with the Government and people of Borno state.\n\n\u201cWe pray that Almighty Allah will forgive their sins and Aljannah Firdaus be their final resting place.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the Borno state Government House, the Senate President told the Governor that all his political engagements for Wednesday had been put off in honour of the farmers who were killed by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore here to condole with you, the government and people of Borno state for this loss. This is a time for sympathy and empathy. This is not time for politics.\n\n\u201cSo we have come to condole with you and of course we have put off the political engagements in honour of our citizens who were killed by Boko Haram ISWAP.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, let me commend you for everything that you have been doing in Borno state and particularly your concern in ensuring that you continue to partner with the Federal government to fight the insurgency here and also ensure that all the IDPs are back into their communities.\u201d\n\nResponding, Governor Zulum thanked the Senate President and his entourage for the gesture.\n\nHe said Borno and Yobe, the home state of the Senate President were one and prayed that the existing relationship between the two states \u201cwill never be soured.\u201d\n\nObi dumps PDP\n\nAnd barely 72 hours to the PDP National Convention to elect its 2023 presidential candidate, an aspirant and former governor of Anambra state, Peter Obi has dumped the party.\n\nObi announced this in a letter addressed to the party\u2019s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, dated 24th May 2022 titled \u201cResignation From Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Withdrawal From the Presidential Contest said his decision has been conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2. Anaocha LGA Anambra since Friday 20 May 2022.\n\nThe letter obtained by Blueprint, Wednesday, signed by Obi partly read \u201cConsequently, I am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal for the PDP Presidential Primaries.\n\n\u201cIt has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.\n\n\u201cOur national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country\u201d.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, a former aide to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo and Director-General Peter Obi Campaign Organisation, Dr Doyin Okupe, assured that the former governor\u2019s name would be on the 2023 ballot.\n\nHe said \u201d You recall that consistently, former governor Peter Obi has repeatedly stated that his not desperate to be President, but he is desperate to cause a change, to cause a redirection to change the way the government of Nigeria is being run.\n\n\u201cAnd to offer solutions to various problems of Nigeria, it is for these reasons he entered into the race. But the various development within the PDP makes it virtually impossible for him.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that all hopes all lost. I can say on his behalf that Nigerians must not give up, we must never give up. Hope is on its way and help is coming\u201d.\n\nOn Obi\u2019s next line of action is, Okupke said: \u201cAll options are on the table. By the grace of Almighty God, Peter Obi will be on the ballot for the 2023 Presidency.\u201d\n\nBlueprint gathered that Obi may likely join the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) led by former Kano state governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso.\n\nSources in the former Anambra State governor\u2019s camp also hinted that he was considering Labour Party.\n\n\u201cNNPP would have been an option, but Kwankwaso is already a candidate, so LP is an option. He will announce soon.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "With less than a week to the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja, top contenders are putting finishing touches to their strategies to emerge as the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nWith former Anambra state Governor Peter Obi pulling out of the party, fourteen party chieftains are now left in the race for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nThey are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed, Sokoto state Governor Aminu Tambuwal; former President of the Senate Bukola Saraki, erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and former President of the Senate Anyim Pius Anyim; Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike and Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel.\n\nThe rest are former Ekiti state Governor Ayodele Fayose; celebrated publisher, Mr Dele Momodu; renowned banker and economist, Mr Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; ex-president of Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), Mr Sam Ohuabunwa; Mr Charles Ugwu, Hon Chikwendu Kalu and Mr Tareila Diana.\n\nAs a demonstration of their readiness, some of the aspirants had traversed the length and breadth of the country soliciting support from party stakeholders, including the delegates.\n\nBut as things stand and the stakes getting higher, the contest, according to Blueprint\u2019s findings, may have been narrowed to Atiku, Bala Mohammed, Wike, Obi, Udom, Saraki and to some extent, Tambuwal.\n\nA quick look at the frontrunners shows four from the north and 3 from the south.\n\nWith the party\u2019s decision to jettison zoning for an open contest, it has become a straight contest between the north and the south.\n\nThe frontrunners, it was gathered, are now in the \u201cfinal push for endorsement by party delegates.\u201d\n\nHow they stand\n\nBut with the decision of an open contest by the party hierarchy, there are strong indications that the party\u2019s leadership is favourably disposed to having a candidate of northern extraction, particularly the North-east geopolitical zone, which throws up Atiku, Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nA top party source said: \u201cThis position was informed by priority the party accords to winning the election over zoning.\u201d\n\nBefore now, four out of the five presidential aspirants from the North namely, Saraki, Tambuwal, Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen, had initially met and opted for consensus among themselves.\n\nThe quartet were moving from one part of the country to the other with a message of consensus on the front burner. .\n\nFormer VP Atiku was never part of the arrangement because of \u201chis political structure and financial muscle to pick the PDP ticket.\u201d\n\nThe effort yielded some results as Governor Mohammed and Saraki came top in a shadow poll conducted by the General Ibrahim Babangida-led Northern Elders, as joint northern presidential consensus aspirants. But the duo and Tambuwal and Hayatou-deen kicked.\n\nBauchi gov\n\nAnd notwithstanding the seeming disagreement, there are strong indications that certain odds appear to be favour of the Bauchi state governor and seen \u201cas being rightly positioned to cause an upset as his ambition has continued to gain traction ahead of the primary election.\u201d\n\nA top party source said: \u201cGovernor Mohammed is being considered by most PDP stakeholders on the basis of his education, experience in both the legislative and executive arms of government.\n\n\u201cBesides experience, acceptability is the most significant factor being considered by party stakeholders, who are insisting on Governor Mohammed\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe Bauchi State governor is well accepted by the various parts of the country, a factor which cannot be overlooked by the PDP we are serious about winning election.\u201d\n\nBlueprint further gathered that delegates were swayed by what they described as \u201cGovernor Mohammed\u2019s excellent performance during his visits to the states to engage stakeholders and prospective delegates in candid discussions over the state of the country.\n\n\u201cLoyalty to the party is also said to be another factor going for the Bauchi State governor. His financial support to keep the party afloat cannot be overemphasised.\u201d\n\nObi\n\nAnother aspirant who enjoyed a reasonable level of support was Obi, who recently dumped the party, owing to some \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d He is seeking to realise his ambition on a yet-to-be disclosed platform.\n\nTambuwal and Saraki\n\nFor the duo of Tambuwal and Saraki, both of whom have requisite legislative and executive experience, they are also in good stead to pick the ticket.\n\nBut a party chieftain said: \u201cYes, they have needed legislative experience, but the party cannot forget in a hurry their role in the event leading to the near breakup of the party in the build-up to the 2015 general elections.\n\n\u201cBesides, Governor Mohammed\u2019s legislative experience as senator combined with his stint as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which gave him the opportunity of being a member of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), are, in no small way, a great edge over others.\u201d\n\nAtiku\n\nThe former VP is yet another strong contender for the office as he is considered an experienced politician with huge war chest.\n\n\u201cAtiku is a leader of the party and a respected one at that. But like Saraki and Tambuwal, he was , at different times, in and out of the party. Further to this, the age consideration is one thing the party leadership and its youth wing are looking at. Nigeria is yearning for young leadership to bail the nation out of the many woes presently facing the people.\u201d\n\nDespite all the seeming challenges, the trio of Atiku, Saraki and Tambuwal are upbeat as they continue to intensify consultations with major stakeholders.\n\nTambuwal\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Tambuwal has continued his consultation with an appeal to the 811 delegates to vote right and ensure their votes count.\n\nThe former Speaker House of Representatives said he has all that is required to tackle all the terrifying challenges in the country in all sectors.\n\nSpokesperson of the Tambuwal Presidential Campaign Organisation, Prince Daniel made the appeal Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nHe noted that the PDP required a candidate \u201cthat is indisputably fit, acceptable and someone with the right temperament.\u201d\n\nHe said the political trend took a new dimension recently with the overwhelming number of candidates vying for the presidential seat on the PDP and those of other political parties.\n\n\u201cHowever, while the large number of political gladiators in the presidential race may be unprecedented and could be overwhelming for delegates across the board, the wheat can be separated from the chaff by the assessment of their evidence-based track record and undefiled antecedent as well as the will power to act, he stated.\n\nThe campaign team said: \u201cWe are living witnesses to the daunting challenges facing our nation. It is needless to start mentioning them because Nigerians are wearing the shoe and they know where it pinches. Also, the solutions to these challenges are well known and some are even documented in blueprints of various Ministries, Departments and (MDAs) of government at all levels. The only missing link is the political will to act.\n\n\u201cAnother campaign cycle is upon us, the PDP, having lost two consecutive presidential elections in the last seven years, now has another opportunity to elect a qualified candidate who knows his onions to face the ruling party in the contest and deliver victory to the main opposition party, hence the popular choice of His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal.\n\n\u201cI plead with us to vote with nobility remembering that we have no other country than Nigeria and we are all in this ship together. The choice you make at the primaries will determine if the ship successfully sails to shore or sinks in the deep seas.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s fate is pinned on you to present a credible and detribalized candidate. We are counting on your patriotism to vote right and ensure your votes count.\n\n\u201cWith our aggravated challenges, bringing our country back from the brink is an economic, moral, political and social imperative. Nigeria is at a crossroads and needs to make effective decisions on its next political and governance steps and we believe that the Mutawallen Sokoto is capable to deliver,\u201d the team further stated.\n\nEkweremadu withdraws from primaries\n\nIn a related development, former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, has withdrawn from the PDP governorship primaries.\n\nThe lawmaker announced his withdrawal Wednesday through the Director-General of Ikeoha Campaign Organisation (ICO) Charles Asogwa in a statement.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe wish to inform our supporters and Nigeria that the former deputy president of the senate and foremost governorship aspirant in Enugu State, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, will not be participating in the PDP governorship primary election scheduled for this Wednesday, May 25, 2022,\u201d Asogwa said.\n\nThe withdrawal was announced just few hours to Wednesday\u2019s governorship primaries of the party in the state.\n\nThe statement was however silent on reasons behind his withdrawal from the contest.\n\nHowever, Blueprint reports that the decision might not be unconnected with the friction between Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and the leadership of the state chapter of the PDP over the battle for the party\u2019s governorship ticket in the state.\n\nRecent alleged moves to dump PDP\n\nThe lawmaker reportedly met with the state leadership of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) over a possible switch to the opposition party in the state.\n\nThe details of the meeting with APGA are still sketchy, but Premium Times gathered that the meeting ended in a stalemate as the both parties could not reach any agreement.\n\nAlso, earlier on Tuesday, indications emerged that Mr Ekweremadu might defect to the All Progressive Congress (APC) to contest the party\u2019s governorship ticket for the 2023 general elections.\n\nLate the same day, Ekweremadu was spotted at the campaign office of the chairman of Abuja chapter of the APC holding talks in what appeared to be a last-minute effort to join forces with the APC to unseat PDP in the 2023 general election in the state.\n\nAbaribe withdraws from Abia PDP guber primaries\n\nSimilarly, Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe also withdrew from the PDP governorship primaries in Abia state, less than 24 hours to the exercise.\n\nAbaribe disclosed this in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAbaribe regretted that his attempts to emancipate the state from what he termed \u201cthe drudgery of imposition and godfatherism\u201d have been frustrated by the selfish ambition of unnamed persons to maintain \u201cwicked governance\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I, Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe, will not be part of this charade. I am therefore withdrawing from the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship election that holds in Abia State,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker explained that going ahead to participate in the primaries would amount to \u201cendorsement of an illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.\u201d\n\nThe senate minority leader, who described the implication of the party\u2019s position as grave, however, urged his supporters to be calm in the face of the development.\n\n\u201cI therefore, ask all our people, our teeming supporters and Ndigbo to remain calm, keep the faith and wait for the new direction, which will be announced soon,\u201d Abaribe added.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

I carried the flag with pride and led us to victory in the 2019 election.\u201d\n\nThe governor remarked that the PDP disregarded his affluence in casting their votes as it showed the party\u2019s commitment to a free and fair electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe decision you took could only happen in PDP \u2013 a party with deep democratic roots. It is only in PDP that such a decision could be made in an open election where anyone of my political background could emerge as the party\u2019s flagbearer.\u201d\n\nOyo Primary\n\nAlso declared winner was Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State who swept to victory in the contest held at the Lekan Salami Stadium in the Adamasingba area of Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nThe incumbent polled a total of 1,040 votes from Oyo delegates to defeat his sole opponent, Mr Hazeem Gbolarunmi, who had only two votes, with six other votes recorded as void.\n\nHaving polled the highest number of votes, the Returning Officer, Ben Obi, who was represented by Abdullahi MaiBasia, announced Governor Makinde as the winner of the primary to a jubilant crowd at the stadium.\n\nOgun Primary\n\nIn neighbouring Ogun State, a political analyst and governorship aspirant, Segun Sowunmi, emerged as the winner of a parallel primary of the PDP.\n\nThe exercise held at the Iwe Irohin House in the OPIC axis of Abeokuta, the state capital where hundreds of delegates cast their votes.\n\nSowunmi, a former spokesman for the PDP presidential campaign, polled 554 votes to defeat his fellow aspirants Jimi Lawal and Ladi Adebutu who scored 30 and 15 votes respectively.\n\nHe was returned as the announced winner of the primary by the Chairman of the Electoral Committee, Abayomi Daniel.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Sowunmi thanked the party\u2019s leadership and delegates for their support and asked other contenders to join him in the struggle to ensure victory for the party in 2023.\n\nBenue Primary\n\nUp North, the Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Titus Uba, emerged as the PDP candidate following his victory in the governorship primary held at the Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi, the state capital.\n\nUba polled 731 votes to defeat his closest rival and the incumbent deputy governor of Benue, Benson Abounu, who scored 81 votes.\n\nReacting to his victory, the speaker thanked the delegates and party leadership for trusting him with their mandate and called for unity among the party fateful to win the governorship election in 2023.\n\nThe deputy governor, on his part, said he accepted the outcome of the primary.

          "text": "Russian forces launched offensives on towns in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, with constant mortar bombardment destroying several houses and killing civilians, Ukrainian officials said, as Russia focuses its attack on the industrial Donbas region.\n\nRussia has been focused on attempting to seize the separatist-claimed Donbas\u2019s two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, and trap Ukrainian forces in a pocket on the main eastern front, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\nIn the easternmost part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Severodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskiy Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield. Russian forces were advancing from three directions to encircle them.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, with the support of artillery, the Russian occupiers are attacking Severodonetsk,\u201d Gaidai said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military said it had repelled nine Russian attacks on Tuesday in the Donbas, where Moscow\u2019s troops had killed at least 14 civilians, using aircraft, rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, mortars and missiles.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify information about the fighting.\n\nThe Donbas fighting follows Russia\u2019s biggest victory in months: the surrender last week of Ukraine\u2019s garrison in the port of Mariupol after a siege in which Kyiv believes tens of thousands of civilians were killed.\n\nThree months into the invasion, Russia still has only limited gains to show for its worst military loss in decades, while much of Ukraine has suffered devastation in the biggest attack on a European state since 1945.\n\nThe war has also caused growing food shortages and soaring prices due to sanctions and disruption of supply chains. Both Ukraine and Russia are major exporters of grain and other commodities.\n\nGrain, food exports remain blocked\n\nRussia said it was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions, the Interfax news agency cited Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko as saying on Wednesday.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, and more than 20 million tonnes of grain are stuck in silos in the country.\n\nRussia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, and the lack of significant grain exports from Ukraine ports is contributing to a growing global food crisis.\n\nUkraine is also a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil.\n\nWestern powers have been discussing the idea of setting up \u201csafe corridors\u201d for grain exports from Ukraine\u2019s ports, adding that any such corridor would need Russian consent.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions,\u201d Rudenko was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cAnd it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage, which it does every day,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia and Ukraine accuse each other of planting drifting mines in the Black Sea.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that Russia was using food supplies as a weapon with global repercussions.\n\n\u201cWe are always ready for dialogue with all those who seek \u2026 peaceful resolution of all problems. I leave Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s statement to her conscience,\u201d Rudenko said.\n\nHe said that Russia would discuss the possibility exchanging prisoners with Ukraine once those who surrendered had been convicted. Russian and separatist officials have said some of those who surrendered should be tried for war crimes.\n\nBritish military authorities say Ukraine\u2019s overland export routes are \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to offset the problems caused by Russia\u2019s blockade of the Black Sea port of Odesa.\n\nThe U.K. Ministry of Defence, in an update posted Wednesday morning, says there has been no \u201csignificant\u201d merchant shipping in or out of Odesa since the start of the Russian invasion.",
