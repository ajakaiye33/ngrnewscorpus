          "text": ".\n\n...Says no coordination between Ministries of Labour and Education over strike\n\nBy Emem Idio, Yenagoa, YENAGOA\n\nCHAIRPERSON of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, Federal University Otuoke, Bayelsa State chapter, Dr Socrates Ebo, has lamented that the ongoing strike by universities teachers in the country is a clear demonstration that governments have completely abandoned education.\n\nEbo, in a statement in Yenagoa, while reacting to the negotiation between the Union and the government team led Nimi Briggs Committee, said it is sad that government has completely abdicated its responsibility as far as education is concerned.\n\nThe ASUU chairperson who questioned the sincerity of the government in implementing the recommendations of the various committees, also decried what he described as the lack of coordination between the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Education with regards to the strike.\n\nAccording to Ebo, \u201cWhen a government sets committee after committee and disowns their recommendations, you know that the government lacks coordination.\n\n\u201cWhat is certain is that there is no coordination between the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Education over the ongoing ASUU strike. The two ministries are clearly working at cross purposes.\u201d\n\nHe berated the federal government for deploying the hunger strategy on varsity lecturers on the assumption that the brute force of hunger would force the striking lecturers back to the classroom.\n\n\u201cOur Union is negotiating with the government team which is the Nimi Briggs Committee. The committee is an agent of government not an agent of ASUU. The committee has reached some agreements with ASUU and presented the proposals to the government.\n\n\u201cThat was exactly what the government mandated it to do. A sincere government would have signed the agreement without hassles. Even if there are gray areas, a sincere government would have implemented the areas it considers agreeable while working to fine-tune areas of disagreement.\n\n\u201cAll these point to the clear unwillingness of government to speedily resolve the impasse. The government on the other hand deploys the hunger strategy on the assumption that the brute force of hunger would force the striking lecturers back to the classroom.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you how worthless a lecturer\u2019s salary is today. 10 years ago a fresh PhD holder earned N138 000. Ten years ago, 200L LG refrigerator cost about N30 000. A Lecturer II could afford to purchase 4 of such refrigerators with his one month salary and still have reasonable change. Today, 10 years after, a fresh PhD holder\u2019s salary has been reduce to about N128, 000 by IPPIS.\n\n\u201cSame 200L LG refrigerator now costs about N190 000. The same salary that could purchase 4 of them and have change 10 years ago cannot purchase one such refrigerators. Yet the same lecturer is still receiving same amount. It has even been reduced to N128 000 by IPPIS! This is a perfect demonstration of government economic brutality against lecturers,\u201d Ebo stated.",

The government also threatened to arrest and prosecute anyone using Twitter in the country, while the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) asked all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter.\n\nBut in the judgment delivered today, the ECOWAS court declared that it has the jurisdiction to hear the case, and that the case was therefore admissible.\n\nThe Court also held that the act of suspending the operation of Twitter is unlawful and inconsistent with the provisions of Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights both of which Nigeria is a state party.\n\nAccording to the Court, \u201cThe Buhari administration in suspending the operations of Twitter violates the rights of SERAP and 176 concerned Nigerians to the enjoyment of freedom of expression, access to information and the media, as well as the right to fair hearing.\u201d\n\nThe Court also ordered the Buhari administration to take necessary steps to align its policies and other measures to give effect to the rights and freedoms, and to guarantee a non-repetition of the unlawful ban of Twitter.\n\nThe Court also ordered the Buhari administration to bear the costs of the proceedings and directed the Deputy Chief Registrar to assess the costs accordingly.\n\nReacting to the judgment, Femi Falana, SAN SERAP lawyer in the suit said, \u201cWe commend the ECOWAS Court for the landmark judgment in the case of SERAP v Federal Republic of Nigeria in which the Judges unanimously upheld the human rights of community citizens to freedom of expression, and access to information. Even though the Court had granted an interim order of injunction last year which restrained the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami SAN from prosecuting Nigerians who defied the Twitter ban, SERAP deserves special commendation for pursuing the matter to a logical conclusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the latest decision of the Court to declare the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria illegal it is hoped that the Heads of State and Governments of the member states of the Economic Community of West African States will henceforth respect and uphold the human right of community to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that SERAP 176 concerned Nigerians had in suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 filed before the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja, sought: \u201cAn order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part: \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of Nigerians at home and abroad rely on Twitter coverage of topical issues of public interest to access impartial, objective and critical information about ideas and views on how the Nigerian government is performing its constitutional and international human rights obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implication of the decline in freedom of expression in Nigeria is that the country is today ranked alongside countries hostile to human rights and media freedom such as Afghanistan, Chad, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe and Colombia.\u201d",

Kashim Shettima as his running mate.\n\nHe described the Tinubu/Shettima ticket as a balanced ticket for the party, noting that Tinubu\u2019s track record and Shettima\u2019s sterling qualities will spur the party to victory.\n\nOshiomhole spoke during an interview with TVC Breakfast Morning Show monitored by The Nation.\n\nHe cautioned that discussions on ethnicity, religion, other primordial sentiments were not helpful, urging people to devote more time on discussing other serious issues especially the lingering ASUU strike.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe more opposition party joined the Muslim-Muslim debate, the more I\u2019m satisfied that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu\u2019s decision is right.\n\n\u201cWe need courage. We have struggled to balance this religious issues in recent years. Tinubu\u2019s decision shows that he will take bold step when elected.\n\n\u201cIf the number of churches and mosques we have built over the years is equal to number of factories, we won\u2019t be at this poverty level in the country\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue with business as usual. I\u2019m satisfied with the quality of Shettima. He his well-read and well-exposed. He is well awarded both home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe should spend time interrogating the personality, competence of Tinubu\u2019s nominee. Soon, pagans will organise themselves to say otherwise too.\n\n\u201cIt is a balanced ticket; balanced ticket in terms of competence, and their antecedents. The opposition party are threatened by this bold decision because they are sensing defeat.\n\nThe APC National Chairman explained how Shettima devoted time building schools, renovating houses and tackling insurgency during his tenure as Borno governor.\n\n\u201cWhat are the fears of people making this comment? They are saying there are plans to islamise Nigerians. The candidate himself (Tinubu) has he islamise his own family members? His wife is a Christian and a pastor.\n\n\u201cIf elected, Asiwaju can be trusted to take tough decisions. The more we indulge people in this conversation, the more this dysfunctional conversation will continue. Nigeria did better when religion, ethnicity were not issues.\n\nHe called on religious associations and organisations to focus on their various religious activities.\n\n\u201cLet CAN manage business of the church, let JNI manage business of the mosques, let the government be in charge of the people including the unbelievers.\n\n\u201cGiven the level of criminality in our system, does it reflect our religion? The fact that a man sleeps in the church does not mean that he is a believer, or sleeps in mosque does not mean he is a believer. Some people go to mosques to steal footwears.\n\n\u201cOur presidential candidate is a happily married man. He has demonstrated religious tolerance by the fact that his own wife is practicing her own faith. How can a man who allowed freedom of worship in his home Islamise the country?\u201d\n\nOshiomhole asked: \u201cAs we speak, we have a balanced ticket (Muslim-Christian), where has it translated to?\u201d\n\nHe called for policy debate on different issues rather focus on religious-driven discussions.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Lagos\n\nThe Community Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has in a strong judgment, ruled that Nigeria\u2019s ban on Twitter, a microblogging platform, was unlawful and inconsistent with the African Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe judgment, which was handed down on Thursday, stated that the act of the Federal Government of Nigeria suspending the operation of twitter violated the applicant\u2019s rights to the enjoyment of freedom of expression and access to information and media contrary to International and Regional Laws.\n\nA lawyer for Robert F Kennedy Human Rights Organisation, Ikechukwu Uzoma, who was an amicus curiae to the case, stated on his Twitter handle that the Court further ordered President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to guarantee the non-repetition of the unlawful ban of Twitter and undertake legislative or other measures on the use of Twitter to enable the enjoy the freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cECOWAS Court in a strong judgment finds that the Nigerian Twitter ban was unlawful and inconsistent with the African Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The court held \u201cthe act of Nigeria suspending the operation of twitter violated the applicant\u2019s rights to the enjoyment of freedom of expression, access to information and media contrary to International and Regional Laws.\n\n\u201cThe ECOWAS Court ordered the Nigerian Government to take necessary steps and measures to give effect to the rights and freedoms protected by the African Charter and the International Covenants. The Court further ordered President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to guarantee the non-repetition of the unlawful ban of Twitter and undertake legislative or other measures on the use of Twitter to enable the enjoy the freedom of expression. The Court finally ordered the Federal Government to pay the cost incurred by the applicants in the proceedings. A great day for human rights, promotion of civic space and digital rights,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 196 others, Media Rights Agency and 8 others, Malcolm Omirhobo, and Patrick Elohor had filed suits at the ECOWAS court last year, against the Federal Republic of Nigeria, challenging the action of President Buhari in banning Twitter in the country.\n\nHowever, the Court made an order consolidating all the four cases marked as ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21, ECW/CCJ/APP/29/21, ECW/CCJ/APP/24/21, and ECW/CCJ/APP/26/21.\n\nThere were also two groups seeking to be admitted as amicus curiae in the matter. The first group was the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Organisation and represented by their lawyer, Mr Uzoma, and the second group was made up of Amnesty International, Access Now, and Electronic Frontier Foundation and was represented by their lawyer, Deji Ajare.\n\nThe counsel for the federal government, Abdullahi Abubakar, was opposed to the applications, stating that he had already filed a counter-affidavit to the application of the first amicus curiae and was just receiving the application of the second amici curiae. An amicus curiae is not a party in a case but a friend of the court that assists the court by offering expertise and insight on the issues in the case.\n\nThe federal government had announced the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria on June 4, 2021, after the micro-blogging platform deleted a post by President Buhari for a \u201cviolation of the company\u2019s abusive behaviour policy.\u201d On June 5, 2021, the suspension was effected by telecommunications companies but after 222 days, the FG lifted the ban and according to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool, Nigeria lost N104.02 million ($250,600) every hour to the ban, bringing the daily losses to N2.46 billion.",

The Niger Delta is called the rainforest because when it rains in the communities here, it also rains in the Niger Delta region forests.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta has one of the largest rainforests in the world. The largest rainforest is called the Amazon rainforest somewhere between Brazil and other South American nations. We must protect this blessing given to us by God.\n\n\u201cI grew up in this community as a child, and I know certain places where named after trees. But now all those tress have been felled down by loggers for furniture and other things. Surprisingly, you can\u2019t find any furniture industry in this area, but can find them in areas that don\u2019t have the rainforest like us here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing this programme to gain anything, but to enlighten our people and create awareness on the dangers of deforestation and the near total extinction of our biodiversity.\n\n\u201cI am not too poor, but I\u2019m also not too rich to say I\u2019m doing this event for any selfish gains. Recently members of my team, others and I, including journalists, went into the Otakeme forest on a 14-day expedition to uncover the spate of environmental degradation of our rainforests in which we discovered that certain animals, trees and other biodiversity have completely gone into extinction.\n\n\u201cIf you cut one tree, plant more because without these trees, there won\u2019t be life. The oxygen we breathe comes from the trees which take in carbo dioxide from the environment and give us oxygen for our survival.\u201d",

          "text": "Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nThe Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) has raised the alarm over planned arrest of its prominent leaders, the flooding of Osun with thugs and the refusal of permit for the party\u2019s mega rally, accusing the Oyetola\u2019s government of devilish desperation in the face of imminent defeat.\n\nThe ruling party\u2019s plan, according to a statement made available THISDAY yesterday by Osun PDP Caretaker Committee Chairman, Dr Akindele Adekunle, was hatched ostensibly to confer undue advantage on the APC in the Saturday\u2019s governorship election.\n\nHe posited that notable leaders of the PDP were already penciled down for arrest by security operatives with many others also tabled for wanton kidnap by political thugs purposely imported into Osun by the jittery APC.\n\nSpecifically, he said prominent leaders of Osun PDP have been marked by the APC and their names already submitted to security agencies for arrest or outright kidnap by political thugs to be aided by security operatives:\n\nThe statement further read in part: \u201cOsun PDP wishes to advise the Nigerian Police and other security agencies in the state to resist the evil offer from the APC no matter how enticing. This advice became imperative as many of the names submitted to them for harassment are respected community leaders, who are historical leaders and are emotionally attached to their various communities.\n\nArresting these noble men at gunpoint for political conveniences of the APC is tantamount to stepping on the tail of a vigilant cobra who is encircled by it\u2019s grown siblings. The State may not have good stories to tell afterwards but we believe the police have a choice to avoid the professional pitfall.\u201d\n\nWithout doubt therefore, it will be a careless negligence of history and professional failure on the part of the police who are expected to take adequate profiling of the state and its constituents, before embarking on such suicidal mission.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chairman \u201cthe Police will do well to dust their intelligence archives before firing a single shot of arrest at any PDP leader in Osun State\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are leaders with no dual face and who have no other place to call their home other than Osun after contributing so much to the development of the State. They are synonymous to their traditional communities. Harassing them is therefore an invitation to avoidable turmoil capable of spiralling out of hand, beyond the shores of Osun State\u201d\n\n\u201cIt must be stated that our party is not responsible for the overwhelming rejection of Mr Gboyega Oyetola and intimidating acceptance of our Candidate, Senator Ademola Jackson Nurudeen Adeleke by the good people of Osun State in the coming election. We expect the APC to take a conscientious stock of their performance in the past twelve years and apologize for their willful failure in the past twelves years, instead of using security agencies to harass innocent leaders of men, whose right of choice as members of PDP is established by laws of the land.\n\nInformation reaching our party also suggest that the rulling All Progressives Congress, APC have stationed hundreds of fake policemen in hotels located at strategic communities in the state.\n\nPrior to this point, our party has been inundated with information on how a section of Governor Gboyega Oyetola\u2019s Iragbiji home was being used to take measurements of some strange individuals with a ploy to sewing perfect match of police uniforms for them.\n\nWe are, however, convinced that such security heresy would not be possible without illicit involvement of formal security outfits like the police. In other to avoid security mixups therefore, it is pertinent that the Nigerian Police and the Department Of State Service, DSS, conduct thorough and proactive steps on this potential breach of the peace before it assumes a dimension the police may not be able to curtail.\n\nWe wish to assure members and supporters of Osun PDP of our party\u2019s capacity and readiness to protect their right as law abiding citizens. Part of such efforts was the declaration of the federal high court, Osogbo on Wednesday, restraining the police or anyone from arresting or harassing one of our members in Osogbo, Ajagungbade Emir, who was declared wanted by the police for no just cause.\n\nWe will continue to toe the part of honor and the law to protect our members against the jungle posture of the drowning APC.\n\nHe said :\u201dLast of the many undemocratic conduct of the State Government is the deliberate and illegal refusal to allow the PDP to use two public infrastructure for its mega rally slated for Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur party had duly applied in compliance with regulations bit we were shocked that the rejected our applications for both the Freedom Square and the Osogbo stadium.\u201d\n\nThe action of the state government is a breach of the fundamental right of PPD members as bona fide residents of Osun state who have inalienable rights to enjoy usage of public facilities as citizens of the state.\n\nWhile we note the fear of defeat now gripping the APC, we caution that the state government is setting dangerous precedent by its refusal of permit without any justifiable reasons.\n\n\u201cOur rally will hold at Osogbo today and the mass attendance that is scaring the APC will still be shown to the whole world. We appeal to our people to remain vigilant and bold to vote and protect their votes on Saturday.\u201d",

          "text": "The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has advised countries to discontinue trade measures fuelling food price volatility.\n\nQu Dongyu, FAO director-general, said this on Thursday at the opening of the 75th session of the committee on commodity problems (CCP).\n\nThe CCP is FAO\u2019s longest-established technical committee. It reviews global issues that affect the production, trade, distribution, consumption, and prices of food and agricultural products. It deliberates key issues, examines the effects on food security, and makes policy recommendations.\n\nTrade sanctions from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are causing global disruptions to trade and investment, including the devastating effect on food and fuel prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDongyu said global food security is threatened in many and often overlapping ways, including the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple conflicts around the world and persistent extreme climate conditions.\n\nAccording to him, market transparency and policy coordination are critical to reducing uncertainty in agrifood markets.\n\n\u201cIt is essential that countries stop using trade measures that add to price increases and extreme price volatility and harm those that depend on global markets for their food security,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQu referred to the recently published 2022 edition of the State of Agricultural Commodity Markets (SOCO) that focused on the structural changes in the global agrifood markets and the role of trade measures in addressing environmental impacts.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the current tendency to trade mostly within regions, multilateral trade remains the most efficient way to promote market access and economic growth for all and only multilateral collaboration can effectively address global environmental challenges such as climate change,\u201d the FAO DG said.\n\nHe also underlined the important role trade can play for global food security and sustainability as it promotes food security and nutrition by linking food surplus regions with those in deficit.\n\nNoting that the global food import bill is on course to hit a new record high of $1.8 trillion in 2022, Dongyu said FAO\u2019s proposed food import financing facility would provide balance-of-payment support to the most affected countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that FAO would continue to guide policy decisions by providing up-to-date and objective information on markets, monitoring policy developments, promoting dialogue, and proposing policy recommendations.",

          "text": "The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has advised countries to discontinue trade measures fuelling food price volatility.\n\nQu Dongyu, FAO director-general, said this on Thursday at the opening of the 75th session of the committee on commodity problems (CCP).\n\nThe CCP is FAO\u2019s longest-established technical committee. It reviews global issues that affect the production, trade, distribution, consumption, and prices of food and agricultural products. It deliberates key issues, examines the effects on food security, and makes policy recommendations.\n\nTrade sanctions from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine are causing global disruptions to trade and investment, including the devastating effect on food and fuel prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDongyu said global food security is threatened in many and often overlapping ways, including the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple conflicts around the world and persistent extreme climate conditions.\n\nAccording to him, market transparency and policy coordination are critical to reducing uncertainty in agrifood markets.\n\n\u201cIt is essential that countries stop using trade measures that add to price increases and extreme price volatility and harm those that depend on global markets for their food security,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQu referred to the recently published 2022 edition of the State of Agricultural Commodity Markets (SOCO) that focused on the structural changes in the global agrifood markets and the role of trade measures in addressing environmental impacts.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the current tendency to trade mostly within regions, multilateral trade remains the most efficient way to promote market access and economic growth for all and only multilateral collaboration can effectively address global environmental challenges such as climate change,\u201d the FAO DG said.\n\nHe also underlined the important role trade can play for global food security and sustainability as it promotes food security and nutrition by linking food surplus regions with those in deficit.\n\nNoting that the global food import bill is on course to hit a new record high of $1.8 trillion in 2022, Dongyu said FAO\u2019s proposed food import financing facility would provide balance-of-payment support to the most affected countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that FAO would continue to guide policy decisions by providing up-to-date and objective information on markets, monitoring policy developments, promoting dialogue, and proposing policy recommendations.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Prodigeezy created the iconic \u201cThis is Nigeria\u201d video; now he\u2019s taking music to the metaverse",
          "text": "Since the days of Fela Anikulapo Kuti\u2019s highly percussive rhythms reverberating across Africa, the Afrobeat sound has filled the globe, with people from different parts of the world unable to resist its tunes and beats.\n\nWhile the quality of the musical genre meets and, perhaps, surpasses global standards, technology has played a significant role in making it ubiquitous. And discovering and accessing it has become very easy with the advent of music streaming platforms.\n\nHowever, music consumption could be on the verge of an evolution related to emerging technologies like blockchain to create non-fungible tokens (NFT).\n\nIyobosa Rehoboth, popularly known as Prodigeezy, is in the middle of this evolution, helping one of Nigeria\u2019s biggest artistes connect with fans through the blockchain.\n\n\u201cMy name is Iyobosa Rehoboth, but I also go by the pseudonym, Prodigeezy. I\u2019m currently the Product Development Lead at Floats Metaverse Systems. At Floats, we\u2019re researching, designing, and distributing crypto-economic opportunities for Africans. That means a lot of things to us, but at the forefront of most of it is onboarding as many people as we can onto the blockchain in innovative and user-friendly ways.\u201d\n\nBefore Prodigeezy focused on onboarding Africans on the blockchain and building metaverses, he was just a passionate storyteller with a camera.\n\n\u201cWhen I was done with film school, I returned to Lagos, Nigeria, and looked around for who was doing what and who was making the most interesting things, and at the time, music was just very, very fascinating to me.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a great way to visually express yourself because you could pack as much as possible into a three or four-minute clip. So I said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to shoot music videos for a while.\u201d\n\nProdigeezy is responsible for music video hits such as Falz\u2019s This is Nigeria and Burna Boy\u2019s Boshe Nlo. However, after growing a career as a music video director, his foray into the emerging tech world happened because of his childhood love for tech.\n\nSnapshot from This is Nigeria music video\n\nTech before music\n\nGrowing up, Prodigeezy loved to do anything related to storytelling and art; however, tech also had a special place in his heart. His father was a scholar and a pastor, so there was never a shortage of information; he was constantly soaking up knowledge as a child.\n\n\u201cI was soaked up in a lot of passive learning and imitating the behaviour of the people around me. My upbringing was, to a certain extent, conservative, but I really just enjoyed staying indoors and reading books.\n\n\u201cI read a ton of books and watched a lot of television. After a while, I was privileged to have the Internet, which was rare for an early 2000s Nigerian kid, but this just changed my life trajectory.\u201d\n\nBooks, TV, and access to the Internet turned Prodigeezy into what he describes as a full-blown nerd; he was almost always indoors playing games and surfing the web.\n\nHe could not get into a university immediately after secondary school, so he had an extra year to learn more about computers, games, and many other things that aligned with his interests.\n\nInterestingly, he got into the National Institute of Information Technology (NIIT), where he studied the basics of computer network engineering.\n\n\u201cI already knew where I was going at the time and wanted to be a computer scientist or engineer. Either way, it just had to be computers. You barely had to know me for an hour before you realised I was a nerd.\u201d\n\nWhen Prodigeezy finally got into the university, he discovered another interest \u2014 graphic design \u2014 which was a good source of income for him. He only enjoyed school because he studied computer science and could realise new areas of interest.\n\nUnfortunately, his learning and discovery streak was cut short by strike actions, a common occurrence in Nigeria\u2019s public universities. Back home, the zeal to continue learning and discovering new things wasn\u2019t there until his dad gave him a delightful surprise.\n\n\u201cMy father got me a camera as a present; it was a DSLR Canon 600 D. It wasn\u2019t something that I was crazy about at the time, but I\u2019d been mentioning it in passing.\u201d\n\nWhile he wasn\u2019t thrilled about the camera when he got it, it was the reason he became a music video director.\n\nOut of curiosity, he tried to figure out how the camera worked. Several YouTube videos later, he began to get the hang of it. He started taking pictures everywhere he went, and it became a habit.\n\nBefore long, film and photography became his new interest, but his father was not fond of his new obsession. Understandably so, because he was mostly out of the house taking pictures until very late at night.\n\nEventually, his parents acquiesced after he convinced them that he had found his new passion and was ready to make it his career. He then went on to study film-making in India.\n\nMusic to tech\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing time in my life, learning about film, the science of storytelling, emotions and basically how to paint the right pictures with visuals.\u201d\n\nOn his return to Nigeria, he landed an internship with Aje Filmworks, where he learnt a lot and made great connections. From there, he moved on to Aristokrat Vision Production.\n\nHis company \u2014 Global Creative Operations (GCO) \u2014 launched in 2018 and is now an established production and creative outfit. GCO is evolving to become a tech company as Prodigeezy infuses his exciting discoveries from the pandemic into the company.\n\nJust like the lecturers\u2019 strike action that led to his obsession with the camera, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 gave Prodigeezy another opportunity to pause and make discoveries.\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, I discovered virtual reality (VR). As always, it started out of curiosity, but I jumped into the rabbit hole and discovered this new immersive experience, and suddenly, my love for computer logic came back.\u201d\n\nHe decided to get an Oculus Quest VR headset and delved into the world of virtual reality. Without the distraction from work, he kept learning more about virtual reality.\n\nBlockchain meets VR\n\nProdigeezy using his Oculus\n\nWhile learning so much about VR, he came across the metaverse, Web3, NFTs, and the blockchain ecosystem. By the end of 2021, he had acquired so much knowledge about the space and had plans to integrate an NFT product within his company.\n\nThe Wizkid, Burna Boy, and Davido NFT idea\n\n\u201cI told my guys we have to start a new company because this is the future, and that\u2019s how Floats was born. And a lot of my attention has been directed at this.\u201d\n\nHe created Floats Metaverse Systems under GCO, and they began to work on some exciting projects, none of which took off. And then they had a crazy project idea to bring Wizkid, Davido, and Burna Boy \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s biggest artistes \u2014 together.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the year, we started playing around with this idea of a collaboration between Burna Boy, Wizkid, and Davido as an NFT.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing idea; we got some prototypes, did the artwork, created a custom smart contract, and did the entire thing. And this was with a lean team at that point, but it fell through.\u201d\n\nAnyone familiar with the Nigerian music industry knows that it would be a cold day in hell before Burna Boy, Wizkid and Davido, currently Nigeria\u2019s most prominent artistes, collaborate. Having worked in the music industry, Prodigeezy knew this but what he had planned was bigger than the big three\u2019s rivalry.\n\nHe continued pitching the idea to many other artistes. Still, no one could envision merging NFTs with music the way he did until he met Daniel Benson, known professionally as Bnxn and formerly as Buju.\n\n\u201cWe eventually got across to Buju, and it was a match made in heaven. He was already exploring how to creatively interpret his journey through comics and give that as a limited artefact to his fans.\n\n\u201cSo we said, \u2018You know what, this is cool. Let\u2019s do this as part of an NFT project, as part of a bigger community,\u2019 and the conversation just kept getting broader. Buju really cares about his fans, like he really loves his fans, and he truly wants to be an innovative force as a musician.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to make music; he is a creative person and wants his creativity to extend to how he relates with his fans.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prodigeezy, Buju had always been about giving back to the fans, and NFTs were a great way to do that. The Heads by Bnxn NTF collection was created so Buju\u2019s fans can connect with him and profit from sales.\n\nThe NFT project will have 10,001 unique NFTs of Bnxn\u2019s face \u2014 the kind used as the art cover for his hit song Italy. Holders of the NFT will automatically have access to Bnxn\u2019s physical and virtual concerts. They will also get to claim ownership of some songs and snippets, making them eligible to receive streaming revenue.\n\nAlthough the sharing arrangement hasn\u2019t been created yet, 10% of the profit from the project will go to a creator fund, and the community will vote for which project the money will be used.\n\nIn addition, being a part of the Heads By Bnxn community also gives access to education about all things Web3.\n\nProdigeezy, Bnxn, and the team behind the project have bigger plans beyond just being an NFT collection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also big on the metaverse. We\u2019ve done a lot of experiments, and we built a game a couple of months ago. Our goal is really to be able to replicate this virtual space of Benson\u2019s creation in the metaverse. And that means virtual concerts and everything it means to be an artiste.\n\n\u201cAs the technology evolves, we will continue building more around it. That\u2019s the roadmap we promised the community. Benson also supports this, and he\u2019s giving us a lot, from music to many other resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombining NFTs with music is still new worldwide, and Prodigeezy is easily a pioneer in the space. According to him, the community is on the verge of something groundbreaking, and while he\u2019s not sure what the final picture will look like, for the first time in a while, true freedom is coming to the creative space.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has charged the youth to seek education, not for government jobs which are unavailable but to arm themselves with skill and ability to fight poverty and meet the needs of the 21st Century.\n\nHe also implored parents to inculcate right values in children, including deep fear of God, respect for constituted authorities and living a purposeful life through continuous education.\n\nMalam Garba Shehu, the President\u2019s spokesman, in a statement, said the president made the calls at the Emir of Daura\u2019s Palace during Sallah homage, on Wednesday in Daura, Katsina State.\n\nHe said more time should be given to the coaching of the future leaders, with basic knowledge of moral values, as the fast changing world, driven by new technology, would be more competitive and demanding.\n\n\u201cI was locked up for more than three years, after leading the country. At that point, I realised and I told my children that your net worth is what is in your head, not what you have acquired in life.\n\n\u201cMy focus has always been on training the children to be relevant wherever they find themselves. I told my children, particularly the girls, that they can only get married after getting a first degree.\n\n\u201cThey already know that I am not leaving anything for anyone to inherit. My greatest legacy to the children is to ensure they are properly educated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president noted that the younger children should be guided and taught history, as they would find it hard to be patriotic, responsible and respectful, without a thorough understanding of their backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWhoever does not have a good sense of history will easily make mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe should ensure the children get proper education. The knowledge they acquire should not be towards getting government jobs.\n\n\u201dWe don\u2019t have jobs in government anymore. With technology, governments are becoming more smaller, nimble and efficient.\n\n\u201cEmphasis should now be on skills acquisition and competence in creation and deployment of technology.\n\n\u201dDuring the COVID-19, we asked all level 12 downward to stay at home, and surprisingly the systems worked effectively,\u201d the president noted.\n\nPresident Buhari told the Emir of Daura, Dr Umar Faruk, that he would be more regular in visits, preparatory to the handing over in May, 2023, adding that the prolonged absence was due to the demands of his office.\n\n\u201cThis is the longest I have been away from home. Infact, the Emir took to the court of public opinion at the prayer ground, when he openly told everyone that I had not visited Daura for close to a year,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said all Nigerians must make sacrifices to move the country forward, especially the public servants, calling for more selflessness and inclusion.\n\n\u201cAt the end, it is only God that can reward your efforts, not man,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Gov. Aminu Masari listed the achievements of the president to include social security, which was created to cater for the poor, and ensure that they received some money at the end of every month.\n\n\u201cNo government in the history of this country has done more to reduce poverty like President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201dHe asked religious and community leaders to bring enlightenment to bear on successful government programmes such as the Social Investment Programme (SIP) through which 120,000 poor citizens in 12 local government areas of the state receive a monthly payment of N5,000 and this is happening in all the states.\n\n\u201cToday, we have over 863,000 children in the state being fed under the school feeding programme.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, this has created 10,000 jobs for women cooks, while 14,000 young men and women enrolled in N-Power.\n\n\u201cWe have food vendors who are engaged and earning their livelihood. All the foolish talk on social media is by those who only think of themselves.\n\n\u201dOur elites are never happy or appreciative until something gets to their pockets,\u201d he said.\n\nMasari said security in the country had improved considerably, compared to when the President came into power.\n\nHe reminded the Daura Emirate Council, title holders, political leaders in the state and citizens across the entire federation to remember the bombings of mosques and churches before 2015 that had hindered worship, problems which no longer existed.\n\n\u201cHuman beings forget easily. It is true that we have not reached where we want, but efforts are being made to ameliorate the situation.\n\n\u201dLook at the size of our security personnel compared to the population, you will know we all have to be involved in securing the country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir of Daura thanked the president for the infrastructural and institutional developments in the state, saying generations would remember and remain grateful to President Buhari.\n\nFaruk urged the President to increase his patience and tolerance as he begins to countdown, knowing that the ultimate reward for all his sacrifice would come from God.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians, both good and bad, know you are doing your best. In life you will have people who like you, and those who do not like you. If you have many wives, or many children, they will not like you equally.\n\n\u201cSome are insulting you and belittling your efforts now. Don\u2019t worry. They will do the same thing to the next president.\n\n\u201cKeep doing your best, and remain tolerant as a leader.\n\n\u201dIn Daura here, even the blind or the leader of all the blinds knows that you have made a great difference. We are grateful, and proud of you,\u201d the Emir said. (NAN)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Women Elevating Women: Myth or Reality?",
          "text": "When it comes to women, there are certain things that inherently leave people, even women themselves, befuddled. What is this befuddling thing, you may ask? Brace yourselves: it is women elevating women, fact or fiction?\n\nOver the years I have been honoured to sit with some of the finest women in my short lifespan, and the one thing I always say to them is that it is high time the archaic brainwashing, generational delusions of a woman in and out of power not helping other women like her, because they may be, or are, competition must stop. Women sharing power collectively amongst themselves can have major positive impact(s) on not just their life but society as a whole.\n\nFor years from birth, women have been deluded into seeing one another as a problem, especially during their career years. We have been taught to cat-fight at every opportunity with one another, or nit-pick \u2013 because, why not? In fact, it is devilish fun for some very scary women. Though gladly, yet slowly, this strategy is starting to fade; it will not happen overnight but eventually it will happen. The truth is that raising up one another can be challenging, and sometimes we can filled with unearthly disdain for another sister simply because backgrounds, opinions, desires, etc., differ. It is okay to have differences in lifestyle and opinion; what is not okay is to wilfully destroy another in the pursuit of personal advancement. As a public relations and media consultant, I have strived to teach women about the endless opportunities and possibilities with effectively harnessing the power of collaboration over competition. I truly believe that we can change the old negative narrative to a future of positive one.\n\nGIRLS\u2019 CLUB\n\nAh, girls\u2019 club, when it comes to this, a lot of women are extremely wary, even though the creation of these \u201cclubs\u201d were meant to aid, connect and grow a woman in business. Now here is where it gets tricky. Men generally are more concerned with profit \u2013 how much you make and how much you can make for them; those are usually the grounds for acceptance into exclusive circles, but women (get ready because it\u2019s about to be a brain or two full) judge things very much different unlike conventional groups, such as: where are you from; where did you attend school; where are you working; who do you know; who are you married to; who are you dating; who are you sleeping with; how often do you slay; do you even slay; where do your kids go to school; where is your house located; how fancy are you; do you get your nails done; how many nannies do you have; who are your friends; what kind of connections do you have; how often do you travel? And so much more (I warned you the list is long).\n\nNow, here is the thing; women generally respect women in some aspects of life, while women fear women when it comes to social circles and work (who\u2019s the boss type scenario, just more high heels and boobs).\n\nThe concept of a girl\u2019s club is essentially on a 50-50 level. I say this because on the one hand it can be extremely beneficial in growing your career, while on the other hand your self-worth, self-esteem and mental prowess may take a brutal beating if you don\u2019t have an iron will.\n\nWith millions of working women (and the numbers are rising) \u2013 be it the corporate woman or entrepreneurs \u2013 the continuous growth of respected women-led groups like: IVow \u2013 led by Favour Ademokoya, Women\u2019s Fest \u2013led by Tengi George-Ikoli, Women in Media \u2013 led by Omolola Oladimeji, Mommy Moves and Magic \u2013 led by Chika Chukwu, Luminer Women \u2013 led by Chinenye Onyemaizu, Brunch and Bond \u2013 led by Yemi, etc., these women strive to grow as well as tighten the bonds of sisterhood in business, power and the home. The evolution of such groups which focus more on usefulness and growth than the glam and pizazz is definitely welcome and a pure fact.\n\nCAT FIGHT\n\nWhen you hear the word catfight, what automatically comes to your mind is two women having a crazy one-on-one Spartacus-type \u2018royal rumble\u2019. I mean \u2013 hair pulling, nail scratching, name calling, possibly biting, open palm slapping felt in the heavens and in some parts of hell \u2013 over a man. It\u2019s ridiculous, really, that a lot of women may have open conflicts over a lot of trivial things. Trust me, the pettier one of them is, the nastier the fight. For years, women have been consistently portrayed as cats fighting over catnip. The evolution of cinema definitely didn\u2019t help the situation at all. Thanks to the boom of social media, a lot of the physical bum kicking has significantly reduced to a much more terrifying weapon of war, and that is exposing one\u2019s secrets or weaknesses online (you know the internet never forgets\u2026) Ah, catfight beyond borders.\n\nIn recent years, however, calling any conflict between women a catfight is understood to be sexist, and enthusiasm has generally dampened for women fighting (extracted from an Article in the New York Times based on Kayleen Schaefer\u2019s \u201cText Me When You Get Home,\u201d a book about female friendship).\n\nConcerning catfights and fighting of any kind, this is 50-50 for me as well, and here\u2019s why; women ripping into one another is absolutely crazy because of sharp tongues and sharp nails on a battlefield of wits and endurance (whoosh, even Hercules will stay away), yet somehow women who fight end up most of the time (rare, but it happens) defending each other. Have you seen two warriors who have a common foe? You know that foe is done for. Amidst the madness of snarls, there is still an unspoken yet very loud rule where you never ever leave another woman hanging. Now, I would happily pay good money to see a lot. Call me crazy, but united women are the best kind of women even if they do not like one another.\n\nON HER KNEES\n\nInsert deep eye rolling sigh\u2026\n\nWhy is it that any woman who gets to the top of the food chain \u2013 or any chain for that matter, means she got there on her knees? For those who may not know what this means, let me explain in filtered terms. The concept of \u2018on her knees\u2019 stems from the notion that a woman\u2019s true worth and rise to success are created from her ability to have quick or consistent sexual acts with men or women as gratification either to start a job, earn a position or get anything at all. This is from archaic, backward thinkers or jealous people who think or deem it fit to think that success is only achieved through \u201cmanly\u201d prowess. Simply put, she has to be a prostitute or \u2018generous\u2019 giver of herself to get far in life. So, first-off: and so what? She \u2018worked\u2019 hard (pun intended) to ensure she survives. Did she do it the right way? To you \u2013 NO, but did she get what she wanted \u2013 YES (don\u2019t bite your tongue trying to think I support corporate prostitution\u2026I don\u2019t, but who am I to judge). The second is: why would that be your first line of thinking in regards to the success of a woman in business or power?\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of women who bash other women are disappointingly high. Going online and surfing women\u2019s pages, you will see that a lot of the nastiest trolling comments are made by women who know absolutely nothing about the other women. I get that demons can live in people, but why give them full control? Why not shine a light on the darkness and cast it out?\n\nSome women honestly need to learn how to just focus on themselves, their growth and, if they can\u2019t say something nice, be quiet and move on. This irks me because it sets women back to the dark ages, making women supporting women a thing of fiction. Oh, I have so much more to say but I will be taking a bow for now. Maybe a part two later on.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to firmly state that there are a lot of amazing and wonderful women who support other women today, whether it is fighting for human rights and choice (Roe vs Wade), or bringing together former First Ladies for the first time in the history of the world while still catering to local women and their development, like Her Excellency Aisha Babangida, or giving women a platform to speak, like Nikki Khiran (Editor, Leadership Le Vogue), or helping to rehabilitate women from the streets, like Favour Ademokoya or Tengi George Ikoli, who does her best to remind women that our individual and cumulative success can only come from being united. The list is endless. Women will always have a vital role to play in one another\u2019s lives. For some, it may be a thing of fiction; for some, it\u2019s a fact; for me, I am here for all the positive things that a woman can do, be it today, tomorrow or the distant future. Women supporting women is a thing of beauty. What do you think?",
          "summary": "When it comes to women, there are certain things that inherently leave people, even women themselves, befuddled.\nBrace yourselves: it is women elevating women, fact or fiction?\nNow, here is the thing; women generally respect women in some aspects of life, while women fear women when it comes to social circles and work (who\u2019s the boss type scenario, just more high heels and boobs).\nThis irks me because it sets women back to the dark ages, making women supporting women a thing of fiction.\nWomen supporting women is a thing of beauty.",

Sarat Buraimah, paid a condolence visit to Ibeshe town on Wednesday, the Ovori of Ibeshe, Oba Alani Gausu, said the victims, who were from the Sumola Aniajogun family of Ibeshe, were travelling for Sallah when they perished in boat mishap on Friday.\n\nHowever, NIWA also revealed that the jetty where the ill-fated boat departed last Friday had been shut down since June 2021 with policemen permanently stationed at the jetty for enforcement.\n\nAccording to the traditional ruler, the ill-fated boat sank after carrying passengers beyond its capacity as well as operating outside the time of safe navigation.\n\nOba Gausu also blamed lack of training, drug abuse and operating after regulatory hours by boat operators as challenges responsible for boat accidents on Lagos waterways.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe boat tragedy that resulted in the death of 17 boat passengers last Friday was down to human error. The boat driver failed to do what he ought to have done before loading passengers on the boat and pushing the boat into water. How can a boat driver load passengers on a boat, push the boat into the water before checking if he has the correct mixture of engine oil in the boat engine?\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cDue to this error from the boat driver, the tide pushed the fully loaded boat underneath a barge and the entire passengers, including the boat driver drowned. It all comes down to lack of training for boat drivers. Many of them are not educated, they operate under the influence of drugs and it is important that NIWA, Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA), and other stakeholders provide training for boat skippers.\u201d\n\nHe, however, enjoined the NIWA boss to ensure adequate training for boat skippers, saying the boat that sank operated above its capacity.\n\n\u201cIf boat skippers are well trained, the scenario where drivers operate outside the 6:30am to 6:30pm stipulated time won\u2019t occur. The ill-fated boat that sank was carrying passengers beyond its capacity. The boat was overloaded and was operating outside the time for safe navigation. We need more training for boat drivers to ensure incidences like this does not repeat itself,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the NIWA area manager, Engr. Braimah, assured the monarch of increased patrol of the waterways to forestall future occurrence of such incidences.\n\nShe also stated that they will intensify training for boat skippers, the Authority will take advocacy and training to riverine communities to forestall reoccurrence of the Ibeshe incident.\n\n\u201cWe are here to condole with you over the death of 16 members of the Ibeshe community in a boat mishap in Mile 2 area of Lagos. I bring you words of condolences from my managing director, Dr. George Moghalu, over the boat mishap that occured in Mile 2. Going forward, we will be intensifying patrols on our waterways,\u201d she stated.\n\nOn the area of training, she said, \u201cIn the area of training, we have been conducting training for boat drivers and was supposed to begin enforcement this July, but for plea from some of our stakeholders who said some of their members couldn\u2019t partake in the training due to various reasons, but we are embarking on enforcement because we have been training boat skippers and drivers and we will continue training them.\n\n\u201cFrom what happened at Mile 2, we have now promised to take training of boat drivers to the riverine communities. The jetty that the ill-fated boat departed last Friday had been shut down since last year June till December. Policemen were positioned there to stop usage of that jetty. How they used the jetty illegally without being caught still baffles me.\n\n\u201cNow, we will be increasing patrol and taking training of boat drivers to riverine communities,\u201d she concluded.\n\nThe NIWA delegation also visited the Sumola Aniajogun family house of the 17 deceased boat passengers, who lost their lives alongside the ill-fated boat drivers.",

          "text": "The Ecowas Court on Thursday ruled that President Muhammadu Buhari violated the rights of Nigerians when he illegally ordered the restriction of Twitter in June 2021.\n\nThe regional court said Mr Buhari\u2019s action was unlawful and in defiance of Article 9 of the African Charter and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe case was instituted by different civil liberties advocates and media rights practitioners following the controversial and illegal disruption of the social network giant in Nigeria that began on June 4, 2021.\n\nMr Buhari issued the ordered to block Twitter in Nigeria after the platform removed his tweets threatening genocide against the Igbo ethnic nationalities of the country\u2019s South-East.\n\nIt received global condemnation, and organisations and individuals, including Peoples Gazette as represented by our Managing Editor Samuel Ogundipe, filed the lawsuit.\n\nMojirayo Ogunlana-Nkanga, an Abuja based legal practitioner, instituted the case on behalf of the groups, who highlighted individual damages emanating from the unconstitutional restrictions.\n\nBuhari regime officials said the administration ordered the ban because Twitter had become a force for negative tendencies in Nigeria, but failed to cite legal grounds for its action.\n\nDuring arguments, the government raised people\u2019s eyebrows when it admitted that it \u201clegally\u201d violated the fundamental rights of Nigerians.\n\nAlthough the ruling may be more symbolic than actionable because of the court\u2019s status as an administrative panel with little influence on sovereign member-countries, the government had relaxed the ban in mid-January while the case was underway, but publicly claimed Twitter had succumbed to its demands to open offices in Nigeria and follow its dictates on policing Nigerians\u2019 speech on the platform.\n\nTwitter has yet to set up any offices in Nigeria six months after the government rescinded its decision, strengthening suspicion that the administration lied about its successes during talks with Twitter in order to save face from the worldwide ridicule that greeted the restriction.\n\nAttorney-General Abubakar Malami in his submission to the Abuja-headquartered court also said Twitter had apologised and promised to respect the administration\u2019s suggestions on social media use in Nigeria.

C. Odili, Director Legal Services, MMSD and has another woman as member.\n\nOpafunso commended the Odili \u2013 led Technical Committee for effectively coordinating the funding and organising of the Stakeholders Meetings of 5th and 6th July, 2022, stating that it demonstrates the ability of women to impact the sector if given the opportunity.\n\n\u201cSince I came on board as Registrar of COMEG, women Geoscientists and Mining Engineers have been given opportunity to play prominent roles in the Council,\u201d he said, adding that \u2018the Chairperson of COMEG Cooperative Society and Head Office Committee, Hajiya Safinatu Mohammed Sani was a woman that has demonstrated the ability of women to impact the sector.\n\n\u201cHajiya Sefinatu Sani is a COMEG-Certified Geologist and also a Fellow of the Nigeria Mining and Geosciences Society, NMGS,\u201d the Registrar said.\n\nWhile saying that women have very important roles to play in the realization of the economic diversification goal, the Registrar explained that upon resumption of office, a Women-in-COMEG-Desk was instituted, with a dedicated WhatsApp group to attend to the peculiar needs of women professionals who are registered by COMEG, adding that the Desk also seeks to encourage eligible female professionals to register with the Council.\n\nDiscussing other important roles that women have played in COMEG over the years, Prof Opafunso recalled that the first Acting Registrar of COMEG was a woman \u2013 Dr. (Mrs) A. B. Durotoye, adding that women continued to serve on the COMEG Council till date.\n\nHe went further to explain that three women served in recent Councils of COMEG namely, Dr. Mrs Stella-Marie Sonuga, Madam Rose Ndong and Mrs Rosemary Adedoja, stating that COMEG will continue to play its regulatory role in the development of the mining sector with regard for gender balance.\n\n\u201cCOMEG will continue to promote gender equality in line with the National Gender Policy of Nigeria, and we want more women to understand that they stand a great chance to develop themselves by taking advantage of the opportunities afforded by COMEG in line with the National Gender Policy of Nigeria,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has faulted the announcement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket by the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nLawal, in a note he personally signed on Tuesday, described the decision as a \u201cdisastrous error.\u201d\n\nMr Tinubu on Sunday announced former Borno State Governor, Kassim Shettima, as his running mate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBoth men are Muslims.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu, Lawan, APC Governors Campaign For Oyetola In Osogbo\n\nMr Lawal, who backed Tinubu during the APC presidential primaries, said the choice of Mr Shettima was a sign that the APC presidential candidate has \u201cbeen cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe northern governors and some northern Muslim elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them,\u201d Mr Lawal said.\n\n\u201cBut if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\u201d\n\nRead Mr Babachir\u2019s full note below:\n\nI thought I will be able to avoid commenting on the disastrous error by my very good friend, Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his choice of a running mate.\n\nI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency. This is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria.\n\nIt will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming. I have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians but most of whom are moslems) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a moslem-moslem ticket towards which I sensed they were drifting.\n\nAs part of my obligation to him, a close friend, I had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of both ticket permutations to him. I have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise, done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends. In all instances I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to\n\nbear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the Presidential ticket permutations.\n\nTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to every one. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests. But I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits. They will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do any thing to curry his favor and to also put well-meaning associates in bad light. I suspect this is what has\n\nhappened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\nIt never used to be like this. While in his hay-days in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell truth to power. He had Rauph Aregbesola, Yomi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.The Lagos days were the days of think-tanks, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But\n\nthese people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems living my friend stranded. Nature they say abhors vacuum.\n\nWelcome the Abuja equivalent. But the Abuja equivalent are people inflicted with the modern Nigerian diseases \u2013 religious bigotry, sycophancy and morbid tribalism. They are mostly political jobbers who are most times not averse to the application of diabolical means. Gone are the days of think-tanks, and strategic planning. Gone are the days of principles and ideologies. Try and call a meeting; they will not attend. Try and make a plan; they will sabotage it. Everything is ad-hoc, everything is chaotic because they excel in such environments. The result is that they have played on his longterm ambition to be President and have built it into a sort of desperation and a crescendo that easily justifies this satanic resort to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. This is the calamity that has befallen my\n\nfriend.\n\nAnd why Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs. And as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\nBut as a popular proverb goes: \u201cThose whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u201d. It appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its Presidential Candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Ibrahim for this purpose. Alhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashima\u2019s two hands are always in his plain sight and empty.\n\nTrue, based on the advise of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the out come of that choice. He has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their\n\nvotes. But he must also be told that there will consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy. This could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c. APC the great! Wu na de try woh!\n\nThe northern governors and some northern moslem elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he\n\nshould have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\nProof of a possible Islamic agenda was leaked when Governor Ganduje, the \u201cKadmul Islam\u201d, gave advance notice that Tinubu had assured them he would be nominating a moslem as his running mate. For those who might not know, Governor Ganduje has a foundation called \u201cGanduje Foundation\u201d which purpose according to its website is to \u201cprovide selfless service to humanity and Islam\u201d but whose primary purpose it appears is the conversion of Christians to Islam.\n\nSo if my very good friend Tinubu in a desperate bid to become President allows himself to made into a religious bigot or even a mujahideen, he is welcome. But it is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, were he to win and become President of Nigeria, it will be as a sectional President; an Islamic President. And he will surely face\n\nmassive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\nExpecting Nigerians to ignore this crass insensitivity to the country\u2019s diversity amounts to acceding to the perpetration of very grave injustice and discrimination against a huge segment of the society. No one who seeks to be president of Nigeria should ever deploy the tool of religious extremism and exclusivism as a tool to win elections. This is very very\n\ndangerous. And this is very sad.\n\nBut, baring any last minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic\n\nof Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There is gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the moslem ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding NO.\n\nHow then do we respond? The decision as to how to respond to this deliberately senseless act of provocation is both corporate to each religious group and also personal to each voter that love peace, and hate injustice. Christians want to continue to leave peacefully with their moslem neighbors at home, at school, at the work place, in the markets and on the streets as we have always done or desired to do. And I am sure Moslems share this view too. No one person\u2019s ambition to rule over us should be allowed\n\nto set us apart and at war with one another.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Mohammed Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-inChief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded.\n\nThere is a story in the bible on how some people responded to similar provocation: \u201cAnd when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king,\n\n\u201cWhat portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.\u201d So Israel went to their tents\u201d (1 Kings 12:16).\n\nI will love for Bola to be our next President. But I am afraid a Moslem-Moslem ticket will be \u201cDead on Arrival\u201d. And the arrival date according to INEC\u2019s election time table is 25th February, 2023. This ticket will drag down the whole APC members to the pit. We all should reject it.\n\nEngr. Babachir Lawal",

          "text": "The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Mathias Schmale on Wednesday said Nigeria currently lags behind in terms of reaching many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 targets.\n\nThe UN scribe said the country\u2019s population of over 150 million has majority living on less than N370 per day, quoting data from the World Bank.\n\nHe said though lifting the people above the poverty line cannot be done quickly, the government must act within the short and medium term to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians were protected in an effective and innovative way including cash transfer programmes and other social protection schemes.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the maiden Africa Social Impact Summit (ASIS) with the theme: \u201cRethink, Rebuild, Recover: Accelerating Growth for the SDGs\u201d, which was hosted by the Sterling One Foundation in Abuja, Schmale said even though there are significant challenges to the attainment of the 2030 agenda, which was worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Nigeria was already lagging behind before the dual obstacles.\n\nThis was just as the Managing Director/Chief Executive, Sterling Bank Plc, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, insisted that wealth generation and economic prosperity remained crucial to solving the poverty challenge in the country.\n\nHe maintained that government must promote economic growth by supporting the private sector to create jobs, adding, \u201cas that growth happens, we must then take that part of the resources to attend to those left behind.\u201d\n\nSchmale, however, pointed out that about 100 million vulnerable Nigerians currently live below the poverty line, adding that, \u201cWe need to do things to protect them while backing the winner; there are successful businesses, there are successful government initiatives and so it is the right mixture of protecting the poor and backing the winners who are doing well for the country and the continent\u201d.\n\nThe UN resident coordinator said given that Africa was predicted to have a staggering 830 million young people by 2050, the challenge was to create an enabling environment for them to reach their potential and become a blessing rather than a curse to the continent.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom our point of view, this should be viewed as a blessing rather than a curse for the continent \u2013 one that can power its economies and societies to greater heights.\u201d\n\nHowever, reaping the benefits of what is often referred to as the youth dividend is not guaranteed; the potential of young people must be cultivated and supported. Like all of us, the young also face the headwinds of challenging megatrends such as climate change, biodiversity loss, the fourth industrial revolution, and growing inequality.\u201d\n\nSchmale said, \u201cIt is imperative that support and subsidies aimed at making life more bearable for the poor really do reach them and that significant adjustment are made when they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, impactful development also required investment in quality education for all and affordable primary healthcare, pointing out that inclusive social impact could only be achieved through the right mix of sustainable economic growth, social protection, and a conducive environment that includes basic health and educational services for all.\n\nHe stressed that the government must identify truly transformative initiatives that would catalyse tangible changes in the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians given that Nigeria and the continent, in general, are currently tracking behind in efforts to attain the SDGs.\n\nHe added, \u201cBefore the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Nigeria was already lagging behind in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\u201cSo the importance of this event is to take time to rethink, recalibrate, revise on how to get there and I think the way to get there is all about collaborative partnerships between the private sector, government, employers, and trade unions.\n\n\u201cAnd also to do two things, one is to protect the vulnerable. There will always be people who lose out and currently, almost 100 million people in Nigeria live below the poverty line. So we cannot talk about economic growth and think that those 100 million will quickly be lifted out of poverty.\n\n\u201cI think the spirit is there, the abilities are there \u2013 it is a very educative society and they just need to be given the opportunity. And you know the famous saying that \u2018don\u2019t give people fish, teach them how to fish\u2019. In Nigeria, people know how to fish, they just need to be given the opportunity.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Suleiman however, noted that the summit had been able to appreciate the concept of, \u201cusing investment to drive social impact to the fore, the same way we have all kinds of summits trying to promote business development; we want to bring people together who are trying to surf for the SDGs and make them work together.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI think it is important for us to recognise that for us to solve poverty, we have to also solve for prosperity. It means Nigeria must pay attention to the things that would lead to the growth of wealth as well because it is from the wealth that is created from higher productivity that we will have the resources for those that are being left behind.\n\n\u201cA lot of people would meet here for the first time, some have met before, they will start working together while some are already working together and they will accelerate what they are doing. There is a place to bring government, NGOs, private sector, businesses together to solve the same problem.\u201d\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",

          "title": "Christians Have Nothing to Fear, Muslim-Muslim Ticket Reflects Nigeria\u2019s Reality, Says APC Chairman Adamu",
          "text": "National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on Wednesday, allayed the fears of Christians over the All Progressives Congress (APC) Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, saying it was a reflection of the current political reality in the country.\n\nHe, however, reiterated that the Christians have nothing to fear over the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as running mate to the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, because the Muslim-Muslim pairing was an act of God.\n\nAt the same time, the Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, has allayed concerns over the Muslim-Muslim ticket, saying it has nothing to do with performance since the faith of the vice-president does not affect performance in any government.\n\nThis, nonetheless, Kaduna State chapter of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), has rejected the Muslim-Muslim presidential combination by the APC, because it would further polarise the country along religious line.\n\nAddressing journalists after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State, Adamu said the choice of Shettima as Tinubu\u2019s running mate should not be a subject to agitation by the Christian community.\n\nAccording to him, no body was willing to promote a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, but the party has to face what he described as the reality of politics in the country in order to win the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe fact of the matter is, God doesn\u2019t do anything in vain. God has His reasons for having two major religions to be in this country and each of these groups, has both people who have the reason to believe and they have a take also.\n\n\u201cWe had a time when Christians led this country. We have time now when a Muslim is running the country and we can\u2019t deny that fact. We can\u2019t have what we want at a point in time, all of us agreeing to one thing.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is we appreciate that, the Christians are interesting, no doubt, about it. We are as practical as we can in this situation and we do hope that people we see reason.\n\n\u201cNobody is willing to promote Christianity or a Muslim ticket necessarily but we have to face the reality of our politics in this country and that is exactly what we are doing. Christians have nothing to fear. Shettima is another Nigerian like me and you.\u201d\n\nFurther, he explained that, \u201cWe don\u2019t have to be all Muslims or all Christians. It is the will of God that this time around he (Shettima) is going to be the vice-president of this great country if we win the election. And we do hope and pray and we are working to win the election.\u201d\n\nAdamu, who claimed the APC national working committee was in Daura to pay Sallah homage to President Buhari and brief him ahead of the Osun governorship election, expressed optimism that the party would win the Osun governorship election and the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\nAkeredolu: Ignore Religion, Work Stops on President\u2019s Table\n\nOndo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, has said a Muslim-Muslim ticket has nothing to do with performance, because the faith of the vice-president does not affect performance in any government.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu, who expressed confidence that Tinubu would rescue the nation, noted that the work stops on the president\u2019s table.\n\nSpeaking at the swearing-in of two new commissioners, held in Akure, the State capital, he said: \u201cMuslim-Muslim Ticket has nothing to do with performance. Let\u2019s vote for someone that can do something. The work stops on the table of the president. It is the president that you are voting for. He decides what happens. Whether it\u2019s a Muslim-Muslim or ChristianChristian, it should not matter to us in the South, because we fought for this.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that given the opportunity, from what he has done in Lagos, Asiwaju Tinubu, will turn things around for better,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new Commissioners sworn in were Mr. Sowore Akinwumi Samson and Ologbese Adeboboye Joseph.\n\nSowore was assigned to the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs while Ologbese was assigned to the Ministry of Regional Integration and Diaspora.\n\nHe charged them to shun distractions from members of their families, friends and political associates, saying he was excited to have personalities imbued with the requisite capacity for the advancement of the cause of good governance.\n\nAkeredolu also redeployed three Commissioners to different ministries. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, stated that the redeployment was aimed at improving governance and deploying talents to reinvigorate certain sectors.\n\nThe former Commissioner for Regional Integration and Diaspora, Mrs. Bamidele Ademola Olateju, was redeployed to the Ministry of Information and Orientation, while the former Commissioner for Physical and Urban Development, Fatai Olotu Aburumaku was redeployed to the Ministry of Water and Sanitation.\n\nMrs. Yetunde Adeyanju, who was formerly the Commissioner for Water and Sanitation was redeployed to the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development.\n\nAPC\u2019s Muslim-Muslim Ticket Stands Rejected, Says PFN\n\nKaduna State chapter of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), has rejected the Muslim-Muslim Presidential ticket of the APC, saying it would further polarise the country along religious line.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, state chairman of the PFN, Kaduna Emmanuel Egoh Bako, said Muslim-Muslim ticket would further polarise Nigeria along religious line and expressed dismay on the consistent disregard for the nation\u2019s diversity by political players.\n\n\u201cFellow compatriots, I am compelled to address a very crucial matter that has much to do with our corporate existence. It is also a responsibility we owe our children. I have noticed with great dismay the consistent disregard for our heterogeneous nature in Nigeria by our political players.\n\n\u201cThis is done in the face of increasing weakness of the bond of unity. It is not only against the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but against the plan of God. The new trend of fielding party\u2019s flag bearers with individuals from one faith is not consistent with our federal system.\n\n\u201cIt has the potency to polarise our beloved nation at this crucial moment that all true citizens are searching for unity. I wish to state that it is not acceptable. It is obvious that the decision is taken to cover up for the failure of government and to also spite other religions.\u201d\n\nPNF, however, lamented that both Muslims and Christians were suffocating under serious challenges, which has further reduced life expectancy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe religious fault lines in the past seven years have been widened. The responsibility of all political parties at this moment should be on strengthening national integration and not otherwise. Let\u2019s unite and build a society on the basis of respect for everyone\u2019s humanity.\n\n\u201cBoth Muslims and Christians are affected by the economic hardships brought by poor leadership and no one should be deceived by this. Therefore, I declare the Muslim-Muslim ticket unacceptable. We shall not let it stand because it showcases our great nation in bad light. I see 2023 as an opportunity to open up our nation to real political civilization,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nShettima\u2019s Choice Devoid of Sentiments, Say APC Stakeholders\n\nA group of APC national stakeholders, has said the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as the running mate to Bola Tinubu, was devoid of primordial sentiments.\n\nConvener of the group, Aliyu Audu, at a press conference Wednesday in Abuja, said although the group initially advocated a running mate of a different faith from Tinubu, it was also aware that in order to build an effective working society, competence must be prioritised over religion.\n\n\u201cWhile we may have advocated for the selection of a running mate with a faith different from that of the presidential candidate so as to give the sense of inclusion to followers of both major religions, we are aware that in order to build an effectively working society we must prioritize capacity, competence, character over religion and ethnicity especially as prioritising such sentiments in the past have not provided the desired goal of sense of inclusion, which can only truly be achieved when all Nigerians experience good governance at all levels regardless of their faith, ethnicity or social class.\n\n\u201cWe understand that reaching this all-important choice must have been a hard nut to crack even for an exceptional leader like Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe are, however, enthused that he approached the decision with all the seriousness, sensitivity and wide consultations it demands and as such believed that he made the best decision in the overall Interest of our unity, national growth, development and progress, without allowing unproductive primordial sentiments to derail or affect our collective goal of building and sustaining a working society, where integrity, competence, character and capacity play huge roles,\u201d he said.\n\nAudu said the party has two leaders of exceptional qualities, who would be in charge of the affairs of the nation and noted that while they happened to be of the same faith, their antecedents in similar responsibilities they have handled clearly indicated that Nigerians have nothing to fear in terms of their religious interests.\n\nThe group insisted that there was need to truly deemphasise the recognition of religion, ethnicity and other primordial sentiments by subjecting both candidates to the test of their competence, capacity, character and commitment.\n\n\u201cThe birth of a new Nigeria that works is upon us and we have every belief that Senator Kashim Shettima is one of the vehicles to that destination,\u201d he said.\n\nNo Cause for Alarm, Jigawa Senator Assures Christians\n\nThe senator representing Jigawa North West Senatorial District, Senator Danladi Sankara, has commended the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, for picking Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate.\n\nSankara, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Information and National Orientation, stated this in a statement by his media aide, Muhammad Nazifi, in Abuja, Wednesday.\n\nHe allayed the fears being expressed by Christians in the country over the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC, stressing that there was no cause for alarm.\n\n\u201cThere is no cause for alarm or apprehension by any group, because both Asiwaju Tinubu and Shettima are patriotic and well-meaning Nigerians. They are very conscious of the requirements of equity and justice in leadership and public administration.\u201d\n\nThe Senator said the choice of Shettima has further brightened the chances of the APC to secure victory in the general election scheduled for next year.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the wisdom of Tinubu and the capabilities of Shettima, whomhe described as competent, cerebral, tested and accomplished leader.\n\nHe said Shettima being an astute administrator, would add value to the Tinubu\u2019s presidency in the service of the nation.\n\n\u201cBy the choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate for the next year general election, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has proven himself as a leader with great wisdom and vision to assemble capable people to assist him provide the desired leadership that would improve the welfare Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSenator Shettima is capable and well-prepared. We are together with him in this 9th Senate and everyone is aware of his leadership capabilities. He will compliment efforts of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to bring about the desired progress and development of the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nCriticisms, Distractions Can\u2019t Stop Tinubu, Says Group\n\nA group, Bola Ahmed Tinubu Solidarity Vanguard, has declared that only Nigerians couldcollectively stop Bola Tinubu from realising his presidential ambition and not individuals.\n\nThe group said they had strong political allies across the 36 states of the federation to mobilise the grassroots for Tinubu to win the 2023 presidential poll, saying the APC remained unshaken, despite social media attacks against the presidential candidate.\n\nAt a meeting in Ado Ekiti, former Oyo and Ekiti deputy governors, Chief Moses Alake and Surveyor Abiodun Aluko, described Tinubu as the most reliable and dependable candidate to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAlake thanked the people of Ekiti for voting APC in the just concluded gubernatorial election, noting that the people still needed orientation as there was relatively low turnout of voters in the last election.\n\n\u201cEkiti really needs to join the movement and shouldn\u2019t be left behind as this is our turn in Yoruba. I, therefore, urge all Ekiti people to get their PVCs and vote Asiwaju Tinubu massively just like they have done in the just concluded Ekiti elections.\n\n\u201cNo shaking, we are standing tall. Despite criticisms, distractions, we are sure of victory, because Tinubu remains the best,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Ekiti Deputy Governor, Biodun Aluko added: \u201cIt is a thing of joy to be associated with Asiwaju Tinubu and since the grassroots is where real voting takes place, members are ready to mobilise massively for him in the coming election.\u201d\n\nChairman and Convener of the group, Dare Owotomobi, noted that members of the vanguard would not be neglected in the scheme of things, because everybody is important in the Tinubu project.\n\nOwotomobi, therefore, urged members to commence grassroots sensitisation and mobilisation for the actualisation of Tinubu Presidency next year.\n\n\u201cWe will concentrate on youth and women mobilisation and this we will do aggressively,because they will benefit immensely under Tinubu Presidency. The former Lagos State Governor is a lover of women and youth and this he demonstrated during his time as Lagos State governor and he will do it again as a President,\u201d he said.\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna, Fidelis David in Akure, Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",

          "title": "Nigeria: Oil Marketers Say Subsidy Not Sustainable, Want Gradual Removal to Minimise Shock",
          "text": "With the federal government and Nigerians grappling with ballooning subsidy spending, unabating petrol scarcity and queues in the country, petroleum products marketers under the aegis of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) have advised the government to end the subsidy regime by adopting a gradual removal approach.\n\nInsisting that petrol subsidy payment was no longer sustainable and was killing marketers\u2019 business, MOMAN explained that adopting a phased removal approach, which would require adjusting upward, the price of petrol little by little, would ensure that consumers were protected against the attendant shocks.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Chairman of MOMAN and Managing Director of Ardova Plc, Mr. Olumide Adeosun, relayed the association\u2019s suggestion Wednesday, during a virtual capacity building workshop organised by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) for oil marketers and journalists.\n\nIn the last few months, Nigerians have been grappling with the challenge of getting petrol to fuel their cars, to power their generators, among others, and Abuja, Lagos and other cities have been the most hit in the fuel crisis due to the closure of some filling stations.\n\nWhile government\u2019s approved pump price is N165, some marketers, who said they could no longer continue to cope with that fixed price have resorted to either hiking the price as high as over N180 or hoarding the product.\n\nMany industry players, economic policy analysts as well as multilateral organisations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised the government to jettison the subsidy regime and channel the money into other critical sectors.\n\nAgainst the provision of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which okayed the deregulation of downstream petroleum sector, the federal government had suspended that provision, citing the fear of possible hardship it would bring upon vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nHowever, the price of petrol just like other commodity prices has been on the rise owing to the cold war between Russia and Ukraine in addition to the oil price rally.\n\nHowever, presenting MOMAN\u2019s position, Adeosun said gradual removal was the only way to address the subsidy challenge which has compounded the bleeding of the already ailing economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo looking forward, what do we say? We are saying that we need government to work assiduously to gradually phasing out the subsidy by allowing the prices to increase gradually.\n\n\u201cDoing it slowly really means that at no point are we shocking the system to the point of collapse because the farther down the line we kick the can, the deeper and greater the shock will be.\n\n\u201cSo, they say the most humane way to cook a frog is to boil it slowly. So we should really be looking at that because I believe, for people, it\u2019s much more palatable to have the product at a slightly increased price than to not have any product at all and you will not be able to get on with life at a price that is not a sustainable price at all.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that is the general mood of the country. So, we are saying that, let\u2019s see the prices for this product get reduced on the one hand, and let\u2019s inject subsidy into things like mass transportation, areas where people are actually at the point of need. We\u2019re saying, let\u2019s look at how we can increase productivity in the agricultural sector by targeting some investments there.\u201d\n\nNoting that the answers to Nigeria\u2019s situation arising from the global energy crisis was to look inward, Adeosun argued that the country\u2019s case could be likened to someone who refused to save for the rainy day.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has had subsidy for so long and had not saved for the proverbial rainy day, adding that the country had been subsidising through good and bad times that the institutions now have reduced capacity to deal with the problem even with the best will.\n\nAdeosun added, \u201cNow, we have the subsidy bill that keeps increasing: N1 trillion, N3 trillion, N4 trillion, N8 trillion. If we look at that money and we think about what we could have done with it around education, around health, around infrastructure, we might be able to have businesses that are more resilient to deal with it. But we are where we are today and the reality is really before us.\n\n\u201cSo, what we are saying, what we stand for, is for a phased deregulation of this sector. You cannot realistically begrudge somebody, a business, set up to run cash flow and make profit to land a product at a depot, for the same price that is recommended in the country, to then move this product to maybe 500 kilometers up country and still sell it for that same price, with the increased cost of diesel to run for transportation, with the increased cost of diesel to run the filling stations, to run the depots, all of these assets are powered by diesel.\n\n\u201cAnd we all know what happens along the journey as well. We may not have tollgates on our highways, but we do have collection points along those highways and these all add up.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot realistically expect a business to deal with that. Because what\u2019s happening right now is that the outages that we\u2019re seeing is causing businesses such as my members\u2019 businesses to really think about their business and how they will survive.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that marketers were now managing to be in business just to provide services to consumers without really making profits due to the costs they had to incur such as the high diesel price, to make the product available.\n\nAccording to him, those who could no longer cope with the cost of doing business had no other choice than to quit, adding that, as marketers, they were also consumers facing the same challenge like other consumers.\n\nThe MOMAN boss, however, urged the government to work towards reducing the national petrol consumption so that Nigerians would be aware of the true consumption figure rather than the fictional consumption or consumption that allows the country to extend its subsidy into neighboring countries.\n\nPeter Uzoho",

          "text": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission on Wednesday lamented that no fewer than 14,500 people have been killed by terrorists in the West African region in under 5 years.\n\nAccording to the outgoing President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Kassi Brou, the figure was recorded in just four and a half years.\n\nHe also revealed that the number of refugees within the region seeking humanitarian assistance stood at 5.5 million.\n\nKassi Brou who is to assume the position of the Governor of the West African bank spoke in Abuja during the handover of power to the new management of the Commission led by President Omar Alieu Touray.\n\nHe said: \u201cFirst of all, the deterioration of the security situation has caused havoc not only in the Sahel area, affecting Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and the North East of Nigeria, but it soon expanded to the coastal zone, hitting C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Benin and Togo.\n\n\u201cTerrorist attacks and herds of bandits plunged these countries into mourning, with close to 14,500 dead in 4 \u00bd years, threatening the peace of rural population, and forcing people to seek shelter away from their home areas.\n\n\u201cThus, the number of refugees and internally displaced people in our Region reached about 5,500,000 persons who are in need of humanitarian assistance.\u201d\n\nHe however said, the Commission has reached out to provide assistance to many of them, as well as to victims of natural disasters.\n\nHe added that a regional action plan to combat terrorism in the region has been followed.\n\nBrou however said the plan would require sustained commitment including financial support from member states for it to be successful.\n\nHe said: \u201cRegional action plan to combat terrorism in West Africa has been elaborated and is being implemented. It will necessitate sustained commitment including financial support from member States to produce the expected results in the medium to long term.\u201d\n\nBrou, who is leaving the Commission after completing his four year term in office, however lamented the spade of military takeover within the region.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the political front, we have noted the deepening of the democratic culture in our Region, with eleven (11) countries having peacefully conducted presidential and legislative elections during our tenure. Unfortunately, three countries, namely Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea, have experienced unconstitutional changes of powers.\n\n\u201cThe Authority of Heads of State and Government having designated Mediators for these countries, negotiations are ongoing with their respective Transition Authorities to support these member countries for them to return to constitutional order and regain their full place in the Community.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the new president of the Commission, Omar Alieu Touray assured the community that his team would do everything possible to bring the ongoing reform to a logical conclusion.\n\nTouray, also noted that his team is committed to the welfare of the community.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut allow me to reiterate the importance our leaders attach to the ongoing institutional reforms. These reforms must be expedited to ensure more focused, effective and efficient community institutions. My Colleagues and I understand that reforms entail taking tough decisions. But we are confident that with the full cooperation of staff and support of Member States, we will be able to take the process to its logical conclusion.\n\n\u201cI renew our commitment to work diligently for the welfare of our community. At the same time, I call upon you to continue to support ECOWAS by ensuring the full payment of the Community Levy and the full implementation of ECOWAS protocols. Your role as Permanent Representatives of your various to ECOWAS is important and we look forward to deeper collaboration.\u201d\n\nThe new helmsman added that to ECOWAS partners, \u201cOur multilateral and bilateral partners (UN, AU, EU, AfDB and individual countries) will all agree that at no moment has partnership been so important than now. The insecurity we face at various levels would require deeper partnerships and consistent collaboration. Our partnership should therefore be sufficiently equitable and efficient to enable us to lift our people from abject poverty through capacity development, investment and fair trade. Most importantly it should also allow us to achieve lasting peace and security across the region and indeed across the whole African continent.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
          "summary": "The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission on Wednesday lamented that no fewer than 14,500 people have been killed by terrorists in the West African region in under 5 years.\nHe also revealed that the number of refugees within the region seeking humanitarian assistance stood at 5.5 million.\nBrou however said the plan would require sustained commitment including financial support from member states for it to be successful.\nBut we are confident that with the full cooperation of staff and support of Member States, we will be able to take the process to its logical conclusion.\nAt the same time, I call upon you to continue to support ECOWAS by ensuring the full payment of the Community Levy and the full implementation of ECOWAS protocols.",
