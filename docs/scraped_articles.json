He therefore urged all the parties to maintain status quo ante as there is nowhere stated in the law where a court decision, obtained later, with similar jurisdiction can override the other.\n\n\n\nArguing his position, the plaintiff counsel, Adebowale Kamoru asked the court to disregard the argument of the defendant on the grounds that the first defendant, National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency\u2019s, NESREA, falls within the purview of the jurisdiction of the court.",

Gbenga Elegbeleye who stated these while addressing a press conference in Osogbo on Monday, at the State party secretariat, expressed satisfaction with the Ward Congresses held in Osun at the weekend, describing it as huge success.\n\nHe also debunked insinuations making the round that members of the Committee did not meet with stakeholders of the party before exercise, saying those peddling such insinuations were on a self-serving motive.\n\nElegbeleye disclosed that the Committee met with stakeholders of the APC in the State including three former deputy governors, serving members of the National Assembly, Speaker of the State House of Assembly, among other key stakeholders of the party.\n\nHe therefore noted that it would be hypocritical of any discerning mind and member of the party to say that those whom the Committee met with are not stakeholders of the APC in Osun.\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cWe came in on Friday and held a Stakeholders\u2019 meeting with the leaders of the party who are critical stakeholders of the party. This stakeholders\u2019 meeting had the Governor in attendance, with three former Deputy Governors, Speaker of State House of Assembly, members of the National Assembly among other leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cSo, you can not say such generality of the party\u2019s leaders that we met are not representatives of the people. We actually met with those we all know as leaders of the party. They are indeed the leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cWhat we did on Saturday was to ensure that only those who got and filled nomination forms, passed through screening process participated in the Ward Congresses, and it is only this set of people that can be declared the winners of the Ward Congresses.\n\n\u201cWe were given the mandate from the National Secretariat, so, there is no way we will declare those who didn\u2019t collect nomination forms, who didn\u2019t fill them and who didn\u2019t pass through the screening process as winners.\n\n\u201cSo, it is those who participated in the Congress who collected forms, filled forms, passed through screening exercise that we can say are eligible.\n\n\u201cI have the forms of each of the three senatorial districts with me and I am using this opportunity, on behalf of my colleagues in Congress Committee to declare those who were screened as elected representatives and new executive of each of the wards they represent.\u201d\n\nThe Press Conference, which held at the Osun APC Secretariat had in attendance the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye; Caretaker Chairman of the Party, Prince Gboyega Famodun; members of the recently inaugurated Caretaker Committee of the Local Government Areas, Local Council Development Areas; Council Areas and Administrative Offices; party\u2019s stalwarts; members of the press; among others",

There was good interaction and documents were exchanged between IPPIS and ASUU.

          "title": "Riding on COVID-19 waves for economic growth",
          "text": "It is not all gloom for the economy and some businesses in the face of Covid-19. Despite the pandemic, the banking sector, telecoms, e-commerce and even manufacturing have leveraged technology to show strength. The tailored measures executed by governments and central banks across the world to meet pandemic-induced shocks on businesses, stronger tech-bases and digital channels in banks, more data sales in telecoms expanded distribution channels for e-commerce companies and improved performance in manufacturing have triggered sustainable economic growth, writes COLLINS NWEZE.\n\nThe cost of Covid-19 to the global and local economies remains high. Global management conglomerate, McKinsey & Company, estimated that by 2025, Covid-19 will have cost the world between $16 trillion and $35 trillion.\n\nGovernments, financial sector regulators and businesses have equally faced the need to solve multiple, competing priorities like rising inflation, capacity constraints, and supply-chain disruptions, simultaneously.\n\nOne of the toughest: how to keep an economy going while at the same time shutting it down to protect citizens from infection.\n\nStill, as the pandemic raged and several sectors like the hospitality industry, airlines, among others count their losses, others like banking, telcos, e-Commerce, manufacturing have major successes to celebrate.\n\nStill, the progress recorded in these sectors did not come cheap. They are a product of regulatory and government supports as well as businesses leveraging on technology to meet consumers\u2019 changing needs.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its counterparts across the globe have implemented various forms of liquidity measures to support their governments\u2019 short-term budgetary needs and frameworks for businesses.\n\nInterestingly, the Nigerian economy achieved some level of growth within the fourth quarter of 2020, when the pandemic was still at its peak.\n\nThe agricultural sector achieved 3.42 per cent growth, year-on-year, which had a significant effect on overall growth as Agriculture itself accounts for 26.95 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Within the same quarter, the oil & gas sector (which accounts for 5.87 per cent of the economy) fell by 19.76 per cent, which reflects low oil prices during the second and third quarters.\n\nIn a report titled: Fourth Quarter GDP and Implications for Markets, Head Research at Coronation Asset Management, Guy Czartoryski, said the least surprising development was the continued growth of Telecoms (12.45 per cent of the economy) which maintained its rapid development, growing by 17.64 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe explained that home working and data streaming likely account for its success. The most surprising sector was Real Estate (6.38 per cent of the economy) which ended its long recession by growing by 2.81 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThe six sectors mentioned so far (Agriculture, Trade, Manufacturing, Telecoms, Oil & Gas and Real Estate) together account for 75.71 per cent of GDP.\n\nFindings showed that the African mobile app market showed strong growth, with overall installs increasing by 41 per cent. Nigeria showed the highest growth, with 43 per cent uplift, followed by 37per cent in South Africa, and 29 per cent in Kenya.\n\nMany Nigerian banks have also created mobile Apps and deepened their e-payment tools to serve customers better leading to improved revenue.\n\nMore bank customers used the Covid-19 triggered fears to embrace digital services, activated their mobile Apps and demanded low-cost banking services that have now come to define sectoral competition.\n\nFinancial inclusion is one area that many banks need to pay much attention to. But successfully enrolling new customers from all cadres of the society will require huge investments in technology and quality customer services.\n\nAside from being known for their customer-centric approach to service delivery, banks took steps to promote digital services, which allowed customers to transact businesses from their point of comfort and in the convenience of their homes and offices.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor non-tech-savvy customers, the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) remains the most convenient and available platform for use.\n\nTechnology has also supported its quest for enhanced re-skilling of its greatest asset \u2013 employees \u2013 for the emerging demands and habits of its over 11million (Mobile App) customers during the COVID era and beyond. All these have reflected positively on the bank\u2019s unaudited results for the full year ended December 30, 2020.\n\nThe pandemic also triggered an e-commerce boom in Nigeria, alongside the rest of the world. The e-commerce companies and platforms enjoyed a rise in activity and profits, while retailers that had not previously developed their online presence found themselves obliged to do so in order to survive.\n\nThe success of these sectors and more in the face of the pandemic followed supports policies measures and supports they got from the CBN.\n\nCBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who clocks 60 years on August 4, has consistently reiterated his commitment to the domestic economy.\n\nThis led to more funding going to key segments of the economy to ensure the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was reduced on the people and their businesses leading to economic recovery.\n\nIn line with its Covid-19 response plan, the CBN under Emefiele created credit facilities for the healthcare, N100 billion, Targeted Credit Facility, N100 billion, and manufacturing sector N1 trillion.\n\nFrom January 2021 till date, N157.5 billion have been disbursed for 29 real sector projects under the Real Sector Support Facility, while N857.6 billion have been disbursed for 234 real sector projects under the RSS-DCRR (inclusive of (CMIS) from inception November 2018 till May 28, 2021.\n\nAlso from January 2021 to date, N26 billion have been disbursed for 10 projects under the Covid-19 Manufacturing Intervention Scheme (CMIS) while N255.9 billion have been disbursed for 78 projects under the CMIS from January 2020 till May 28, 2021.\n\nLikewise, 98 healthcare projects have been funded to a tune of N97.44 billion under the Healthcare Sector intervention Facility (HSIF) as of May 28, 2021.\n\nIn the five-year Policy Trust of the CBN- 2019 to 2024, Emefiele promised to improve access to credit for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) as well as spur consumer spending to stimulate growth and enhance employment, among others.\n\nFollowing an apparent credit squeeze that started in March 2019, the CBN boss modified some long-staring rules that were perceived, rightly or wrongly as one of the constraints to bank lending.\n\nTo unlock the potential of the real sector to engender output growth, value-added productivity and job creation, the apex bank recently established a N300 billion Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF).\n\nThe facility is supporting large enterprises for startups and expansion financing needs of N500 million up to a maximum of N10 billion in key sectors of the economy, especially manufacturing, agriculture, agricultural value chain, and services.\n\nThe facility is also meant to increase output, generate employment, diversify the revenue base, increase foreign exchange earnings and provide input for the industrial sector on a sustainable basis.\n\nIn the economic outlook for 2021, the former Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, LCCI, Director-General, Muda Yusuf, said several governments globally provided fiscal stimulus to support households, small businesses, and their economies generally, while central banks eased monetary policy conditions through large-scale purchases of financial assets and interest rate reduction to rescue their respective economies.\n\nBanks show strength despite headwinds\n\nThe CBN has also assured banks\u2019 depositors of the resilience, safety and soundness of commercial banks and other financial institutions despite Covid-19-induced challenges on global economies.\n\nCBN Acting Director, Corporate Communications Department, Osita Nwanisobi, said that stress tests conducted on Nigerian banks showed the soundness and reliance of the banking sector. He said the banks had proven to be very sturdy in spite of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, routine bank examination and stress tests for financial institutions operating in the country indicated that no Deposit Money Bank (DMB) licensed by the CBN is currently under any form of financial distress.\n\nHe said assured depositors that the banks have adequate capital to absorb unexpected losses that may arise.\n\nHe made this clarification in response to certain false and unfounded stories circulating in social media attacking the soundness and safety of some Nigerian banks.\n\nIn line with the bank\u2019s resolve to ensure adherence to prudential standards, Nwanisobi said the CBN continues to monitor the activities of banks in order to ensure that no individual or institution breaches the laid down guidelines.\n\nHe, therefore, advised the banking public to disregard any report alleging insolvency in the Nigerian banking sector.\n\nSimilarly, he reiterated the desire of the CBN to prioritize financial inclusion as a measured approach to increase the number of adults included in financial services provided by banks in Nigeria.\n\nNwanisobi, therefore, urged members of the banking public to take advantage of the services provided by the banks, particularly the intervention programmes initiated by the CBN, to enhance their economic status and contribute to overall national development.\n\nPolicy plan for economic growth\n\nThe CBN under Emefiele had in April 2020 developed a three-year policy plan to revive the economy. The Policy Response Timeline will guide Nigeria\u2019s crises management, and orderly rebooting of the economy by relying on homegrown solutions.\n\nIn a report titled: Turning COVID-19 Tragedy into an Opportunity for a New Nigeria, the CBN boss said the policy framework will come in three phases- immediate term policy of zero to three months, short-term policy priorities of zero to 12 months and medium-term policy priorities of zero to three years.\n\nEmefiele said the outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in China has rapidly permeated and profoundly changed the world. While the crisis is first and foremost a public health issue that has claimed the lives of over 123,600 people worldwide, and counting, the economic damages are unprecedented on several fronts.\n\n\u201cThat is why in response to COVID-19, the CBN is strengthening the Nigerian economy by providing a combined N3.5 trillion in targeted measures to households, businesses, manufacturers ad healthcare providers. These measures are deliberately designed to support the Federal Government\u2019s immediate fight against COVID-19, to build a more resilient, more self-reliant Nigerian economy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe do not know what the world will look like after this pandemic. Countries may continue to look inwards and globalisation, as we know it today, maybe dead for a generation. Therefore, as a nation, we cannot afford to continue relying on the world for our food, education and healthcare. This time has come to fully transform Nigeria into a modern, sophisticated and inclusive economy that is self-sufficient. Rewards the hardworking, but protect the poor and vulnerable, and can compete internationally across a range of strategic sector,\u201d he added.\n\nEmefiele said: \u201cFor a country of over 200 million people, and projected to be about 450 million in a few decades, we can no longer ignore repeated warnings about the dangers that lie ahead if we don\u2019t produce locally because the security and well-being of our nation are contingent on building a well-diversified and inclusive productive economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere would be no need to continually rely on the world for anything and everything at any time. He said now is the time for Nigeria to look inwards as a nation and guarantee food security, high quality and affordable healthcare, and cutting-edge education for the people,\u201d he said.",

We are thinking of holding it either in October or early November. Statutorily, the tenure of the NWC ends in December.\n\n\u201cThe governors resolved to meet on August 9 to decide the exit date of Secondus and NWC. The decision will then be communicated to all organs of the party.\u201d\n\nThe anti-Secondus campaign has heightened in the last few days with a plot to use some peripheral NWC members, especially some of those serving as deputies to national officers, to pass a vote of no confidence on Secondus.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people are floating a cash-for-sack deal against Secondus and the NWC but they cannot succeed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf the NWC is sacked before its tenure ends, there will be anarchy in the party,\u201d a member of the party executive said.\n\nWhile writing off the NWC, WIke had said: \u201dAn opposition party ought to be united, to work, to take over the affairs of government, because people are waiting for this opportunity, but the current leadership of NWC is not prepared for that. Rather, what they have done is to constitute some people to sow a seed of discord among governors for their own selfish interest. And that will boomerang; that will consume them.\n\n\u201cYes. If you ask me as a member of PDP, am I ready to support PDP to take over, yes. But, if you ask me currently as it is, is the leadership of the party willing for us to harvest this opportunity for a change, I will say no.\n\n\u201cThe present NWC is not interested or doing anything to take over the rein of government in 2023.\u201d",

          "title": "LADOL\u2019s unending failures to Nigeria as a zone operator",
          "text": "By Akpan Peters\n\nAs Dr. Jadesimi noted, LADOL must exceed international standards. However, LADOL is sadly developing a reputation for hostility towards international business.\n\nNigeria has continued to lose multi-billion dollar potential investments in the Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics (LADOL) base due to the unending threat to foreign investor crisis in the zone.\n\nLADOL, which is perhaps, the most strategically located free zone, has earned a notorious reputation for crisis and negative publicity due to the apparent inability of the zone managers to court investors and put their house in order.\n\nAt the last count, the zone was characterised by no fewer than eight litigations in Nigeria and abroad, including arbitrations in the United Kingdom.\n\nThis has scared potential foreign investors and stalled ongoing investments by foreign investors operating in the zone to make Nigeria a hub of oil and gas business in sub-Saharan Africa, while Nigeria Government have made all efforts to solve various issues.\n\nThe implication is that while the zone managers have continued to lay claim to large expanse of underdeveloped land, there is a consensus of opinion among operators that they have demonstrated lack of ability to attract foreign investors to utilise the opportunities at the zone.\n\nThe wider implication is that the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), which is the land owner, and indeed, the federal government have continued to lose revenues due to the inability of zone operators to attract investments.\n\nThe Nigerian economy, which is the worst-affected, has also continued to lose opportunities to generate employment and grow the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nIn the greater part of the past one decade, the name \u2018LADOL\u2019 has become synonymous with crisis and negative publicity as the zone managers have continued to be on the news for the wrong reasons.\n\nDespite the intervention of the various government agencies, LADOL\u2019s reputation of non-tolerance for competition has continued to pit it against reputable foreign investors, forcing a US company previously located in the zone to exit Nigeria.\n\nThe zone managers have been accused of effectively deploying lockouts, cancellation of operating licence, excessive charges and frivolous litigations as tools to frustrate investors out of the zone.\n\nIndeed, for more than 20 years of operating the free zone, only about six hectares of the underdeveloped land was able to host tangible investments out of 76 hectares, while the rest remains largely empty land. Other investments for which they have claimed to have spent millions of dollars are only visible on the pages of newspapers, and not at the free zone.\n\nRegulators are also said to be probing the zone managers\u2019 indigenous\n\nstatus claim following the allegation that the two foreign companies that allegedly own the 84 per cent stake in LADOL \u2013 Sable Offshore Investment Limited, and Alsba Ventures, were allegedly registered in the British Virgin Island.\n\nIt is also well known all over the world that British Virgin Island is a tax haven where companies do not pay tax while we knew they received over 100m usd through exclusive service in the Freezone during Egina project..\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThese companies are shell companies and regulators and anti-corruption agencies in most countries have had cause to probe the business activities of these companies.\n\nBy Nigeria\u2019s company laws, particularly the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), when two foreign companies establish a company in Nigeria, the new entity can be rightly regarded as a foreign company and not a wholly Nigerian as claimed by LADOL.\n\nThe zone managers once claimed that the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) supported it with $25million from the Nigerian Content Fund, while the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) supported it with N6.09billion facility. It was not clear what the loans were meant for but it is very clear that the opportunities and benefits LADOL have enjoyed are clearly meant for Nigerian companies.\n\nMany Local entities struggle to raise such loans to stimulate the Nigeria Economy, thus LADOL was also privileged to be among the companies that used indigenous status to access the federal government\u2019s Nigerian Content Intervention Fund but how the fund was utilised is known to only LADOL and its foreign promoters.\n\nSadly, the company has refused to use the privileges it has enjoyed under the Nigerian Content Act to help create job opportunities for Nigerians by partnering foreign companies in a win-win situation.\n\nAlso, very recently, the zone managers went to town with no evidence of the news that the federal government has granted them a fresh 25-year lease, a development, which oil and gas operators and maritime experts described as \u201crewarding failures\u201d.\n\nThe free zone managers, rather than build partnerships and alliances to attract investors, were said to have focused on signing memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with portfolio investors, while engaging reputable and credible investors in unnecessary fights and frivolous litigations.\n\nApart from frustrating investors, the zone managers were also accused by the NPA of violating the terms of their lease and shortchanging the federal government.\n\nBefore NPA cancelled its lease, the regulator had accused the zone managers of shortchanging the federal government to the tune of N16 billion, an allegation they vehemently denied.\n\nMedia reports showed that the NPA, which is the landlord of the free zone, was investigating an allegation that the free zone managers neither informed nor obtained an official approval for the additional 30 hectares of sand-filled area from the landlord.\n\nThe federal government agencies were also said to be investigating the legality of its jetty, following an allegation that it was not dully licensed.\n\nHowever, the alleged violation of the terms of the lease did not go unnoticed as the NPA wielded the big stick in 2019 by revoking its lease as widely reported in the media.\n\nNPA, however, granted a fresh lease under new terms to the zone managers for 5.7574 hectares of developed land and 69, 2874 hectares of undeveloped land.\n\nThis fueled a dispute, which is currently a subject of litigation.\n\nNo investor will put its money in an environment characterized by unending crisis, litigations and negative publicity, which the zone has come to represent.\n\nEven the few investors that kept faith with Nigeria were said to be facing excessive charges and other acts of hostility by the free zone managers\n\nFor instance, an American pipe-coating company, Africcoat was forced to exit Nigeria by operators of the zone.\n\nWhile other free zones nationwide are championing the struggle to woo investors, the operating environment at the zone is characterised by open hostility against investors.\n\nThe investors\u2019 woes were compounded in April 2019 when an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Mr. Innocent Oshemi, guarding the zone, went berserk and shot and killed a fellow NSCDC officer and wounded a Korean staff, working at the fabrication and integration yard in the free zone.\n\nThe armed security guard was said to have gone acted berserk out of control around the SHI-MCI yard, killing his colleague during an argument, and shooting a Korean SHI-MCI employee operating a crane within the yard at the time.\n\nThe incident not only scared away any actual or potential investors but also dealt a great blow to trade between Nigeria and South Korea.\n\nTo end this unending crisis, stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s maritime industry had reportedly stressed the need for the federal government to liberalise the LADOL Free Zone in Lagos by licensing many free zone operators to take charge of the zone so as to break the chain of monopoly that had hindered the development of the aroundover 121 114.5 hectares of land in the zone.\n\nThey urged the federal government to split the zone into many free zones and license other managers to utilise the investment opportunities abundant at the zone.\n\nSome of the stakeholders argued that the purpose of setting up the free zones (FZs) by the federal government was to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), generate employment, encourage transfer of technical skills to Nigerians and boost the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThey lamented that rather than attract investments, the LADOL free zone has been enmeshed in controversies in recent years, adding that such controversies scare reputable investors.\n\nThey cited what they described as multiple litigations between the investors and the zone managers and NPA\u2019s allegation as some of the challenges hindering investments at the zone.\n\nThey have also argued that the over 121around 114.5 hectares of land is too big to be managed by the zone management company \u2013 Global Resource Management Free Zone Company (GRMFZC).\n\nAccording to the analysts, the zone operators\u2019 continued stranglehold on 121 114.5 hectares of land at Tarkwa Bay in Lagos has hampered the federal government\u2019s efforts to attract investors to the Free Zone.\n\nThey noted that for over 20 years that LADOL has been managing the zone, a large chunk of the 121 hectares of land has remained undeveloped because of the operators\u2019 apparent lack of capacity to form alliances with local and foreign investors to boost developments at the FZ.\n\nThey also argued that the overlapping and conflicting roles of LADOL have resulted to exorbitant charges that scared away investors, thus defeating government\u2019s objective of making the FZ an investment hub.\n\nA Warri-based analyst, Mr. Nelson Peters had once pointed out that as the agent of regulator (NPA), LADOL also exercises governmental and regulatory powers over all free zone enterprises within the zone.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that this monopolistic tendency has frustrated the free zone operators\u2019 crucial role of attracting investors as they now focused on pursuing their pecuniary benefits at the detriment of the foreign and local investors in the zone and the Nigerian economy,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2026.Peters, a Nigerian content analyst, writes from Warri, Delta State",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC) has disclosed that with Nigeria recording about 500 cases daily in the last seven days, the country\u2019s test positivity ratio has increased to about six per cent.\n\nIt further reiterated that the Delta variant is in the country with the PSC particularly expressing concern about the situation in Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, Ekiti and Kwara States, adding that the variant in these states account for the rising cases in these states and across the nation with Lagos alone accounting for over 50 per cent of the number of cases.\n\nBoss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee (PSC), on COVID-19, said this on Monday at the national media briefing.\n\nAccording to him, the situation is worrisome and shows that the country is not out of the woods yet.\n\n\u2018The world has added about 4 million cases and under 100,000 deaths in the last one week. All countries in the West African region are beginning to see the 3rd Wave while Nigeria is recording about 500 cases daily in the last 7 days. Our Test Positivity Ratio has increased to about 6%. This is worrisome and shows that we are not out of the woods yet,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018It is no more news that the Delta variant has made its way into Nigeria. The PSC is particularly concerned about the situation in Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, Kano, Plateau States and the FCT as this variant has made way into these states and accounts for the rising cases in these states and across the nation. Lagos alone accounts for over 50% of the number of cases. The DG NCDC will elaborate on this development.\n\n\u2018This development calls for great caution because the virus is very virulent and raging in so many other countries. We must therefore keep observing the NPIs and also ensure that we get vaccinated. Vaccination prevents severe cases and reduces hospitalisation and deaths but does not eliminate contacting it, hence the need to religiously observe the NPIs.\n\n\u2018We need to test more and detect early enough so that people who have contracted this virus can be treated early.\u2019\n\nThe SGF announced that the country currently has 143 molecular laboratories (54 private and 89 public) where testing can take place, urging Nigerians to make themselves available for testing, urging them to test regularly.\n\nHe also said the PSC is ready to publish over 500 travellers who violated the travel protocol and those who evaded quarantine this week. Similarly, Mustapha said those who had their passports barred for six months will be lifted in the coming days.\n\n\u2018The CG Immigration will be directed to lift the suspension and to also activate the new sanctions. Travellers who did not go for their Day-7 test will have restrictions placed on their international passports for six months while those who evaded quarantine will similarly have restrictions on their international passports for one year,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe PSC boss also announced that the National International Travel Portal is being reviewed to better enhance a hitch-free experience for travellers. This review will be completed in the next two weeks. Mustapha said the Akanu Ibiam International Airport Enugu is ready for reopening saying: \u2018A date will be announced in due course after few logistics issues are cleared.\u2019\n\nHe said that the PSC has also reviewed the travel protocols for diplomatic travellers.\n\nHe thanked the government of the United States for donating over 4 million doses of Moderna Vaccines, saying the vaccines will go a long way in vaccinating more Nigerians as only two per cent of the nation\u2019s population have been vaccinated.\n\n\u2018We thank the Government and people of the USA for this gift and we promise that it will be utilised judiciously. Also, important to note is that every state of this country now has at least one U701 Ultra Cold Chain equipment to store ultra-cold vaccines,\u2019 the SGF said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022Stakeholders canvass reinstatement of dissolved NWC without Oshiomhole\n\n\u2022Your ward congresses are a nullity, says PDP\n\n\u2022APC: Opposition party not an interpreter of law\n\nChuks Okocha and\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nWorried by the narrow escape of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in retaining Ondo State and the broader implications of the pronouncement by the Supreme Court, particularly, as it relates to the position of the National Chairman of APC, Mai Mala Buni, President Muhammadu Buhari, from faraway London, had directed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to take charge of the legal concerns and come up with a decision in the overall interest of the party.\n\nOsinbajo, too, wasted no time in summoning a meeting of all the lawyers in the cabinet to deliberate on what to do as the congresses were just a day away, Saturday to be precise.\n\nAt the meeting, competent sources said, the consensus of opinions was that the party should pause the congresses slated for last Saturday before weighing other options. But only Malami objected, arguing that the exercise could go ahead, regardless.\n\nThose in attendance at the meeting which held at the vice president\u2019s office were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola; Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed; Minister of State for Labour, Mr. Festus Keyamo; and Professor Tahir Mamman, a former Director General of the Nigeria Law School and legal adviser/member of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC.\n\nAfter what allegedly turned out a heated debate, everyone at the meeting, THISDAY gathered, agreed that the first step to addressing the \u201celephant in the room\u201d was to suspend the congresses, which unfortunately, held last weekend.\n\nA majority of those in attendance, THISDAY was told, shared some of the argument that followed the Supreme Court judgment on Ondo and had contended that it was only logical to minimize the damage the APC might suffer in the final analysis, by first suspending the congresses and then, fashion out other possible options.\n\nBut Malami would have none of it. \u201cHe disagreed with the submissions of others and insisted that the congresses could go ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe resolution reached was to suspend the congresses,\u201d a source privy to the meeting stated.\n\nWhile debate was still on, Osinbajo was said to have made effort to reach the President by phone to intimate him of developments but failed.\n\nHaving reached the decision to pause the congress, Osinbajo decided to call Governor Buni on the resolution to suspend to congresses scheduled for Saturday.\n\nBut to his shock, Buni flatly rejected his directive, insisting like Malami that the congresses would go ahead as planned. Malami and Buni belong to the CPC tendency of the APC.\n\nIt was a bemused Osinbajo, who watched helplessly as Buni refused to obey his directive to suspend the congresses.\n\nAccording to sources, Malami and Buni\u2019s hesitance to discard experts\u2019 opinions despite glaring danger might have been because some people identified as cabal in the presidency did not want to lose their current hold on the party especially, that they were believed to have had a choice presidential candidate in mind, of which a change in the course of the party could undo.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the APC is currently facing an existential threat as two major tendencies wrestle for control of the party. These tendencies as represented by the legacy parties that merged to form the ruling party \u2013 the Congress for Progressive Change and the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nIndeed, there was said to be an understanding at inception that while the CPC, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, would control the government, how the party is run would be the prerogative of the ACN, a party led by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nUnfortunately, the fear of what might likely be in 2023 has begun dawn on and force the CPC tendency to not only renege on this understanding, but also doing all within its reach to completely take over the party and dominate the other tendencies especially, the ACN.\n\nTherefore, while the PDP wing of the merger, led by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has since been relegated from exerting any form of control or accorded any sense of belonging especially, that his other allies had since returned to their former party, the PDP; the CPC tendency has literally taken over the party now and is desperately working to consolidate its hold ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThus, by going ahead with the congresses last weekend, despite concerns about the legal implications that option portended for the party, it demonstrates once again that it is willing to risk the existence of the party in pursuit of its narrow objective. The CPC tendency clearly seeks to plant his loyalists across the board and finally cut other tendencies to size even when its equity to the merger (states controlled pre-2015 polls) was the least, when compared to other legacy parties.\n\nHowever, shedding more light on the Supreme Court judgment in a position paper, which appears in sync with Festus Keyamo\u2019s position on the raging crisis, a former National Legal Adviser of the APC, Babatunde Ogala stated, \u201cI have read suggestions by my brother silk, Festus Keyamo, SAN to the effect that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Party as well as its Board of Trustees (BOT) should take charge of the affairs of the Party through a committee set up by either organ.\n\n\u201cThis is a very wise proposition except that NEC alongside all other organs of the Party were purportedly dissolved at a meeting convened and presided over by Governor Mai Mala Buni. Sadly, the Notice for the NEC meeting was issued by the same tainted leadership of the party.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is my view that the meeting may not have been properly convened in the eyes of the law and its resolution(s) may have been void ab initio. This gives a leeway for the NEC to resume its duties and convene meetings immediately where it will decide the future of the party.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Trustees of the Party was never and has still not been constituted till date. So, in effect, the Party does not have a BOT that could convene even a meeting of the BOT, talk more of convening a National Convention or indeed any statutory meeting of the Party.\n\n\u201cThe reinstatement of the dissolved National Working Committee (NWC) without the erstwhile Chairman, who was suspended from office by Order of a court of competent jurisdiction should be seriously considered in other to cloak the impending Ward, Local Government Area and State Congresses as well as National Convention with the imprint of legality.\n\n\u201cMany of the NWC members have since moved on to better things and would be reluctant to return to their positions but this is the hard decision we must all take for the sake of saving our dear party,\u201d Ogala maintained.\n\nOgala, who was not physically present at the meeting, continued: \u201cIt is my opinion, that in this moment, there is no place for parochial grandstanding. Just as the former NWC accepted their dissolution without much hassle, it is time for the current Caretaker Committee to sacrifice for the posterity of APC.\n\n\u201cThe fate of APC is at stake in that all successes, victories and triumphs gained by the party will continue to hang on a very thin thread in the face of the progressive attitude of our courts on election and political matters.\u201d\n\nHe contended that the decision of the Supreme Court had opened the flood gates for endless litigation challenging every action and decision of the APC leadership as presently constituted.\n\n\u201cIn closing,\u201d Ogala said, \u201cI acknowledge the Supreme Court for its decision and specifically note the hint the Court gave to us to clean our acts and come into the bounds of legality before the worse happens at the forthcoming general election.\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), last night, said the ward congress conducted by the APC amounted to a nullity, given the pronouncement of the Supreme Court, which invalidated the Buni-led national executive.\n\nThe PDP, therefore, vilified Buni and other APC leaders for deceiving innocent Nigerians and cajoling them to participate in the needless exercise, which ended in violent crisis and avoidable deaths, when they knew it was all in futility.\n\nBut the leadership of the APC , while dismissing the PDP as no interpreter of the law, has asked it to keep its \u201cbaseless comments\u201d on APC leadership to itself, saying it was aimed at distracting attention from its depleting fortunes and rudderless leadership, which has led its members and leaders abandoning the party.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the opposition party, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan said, it was indeed callous that the leaders of the APC, despite knowing that any process conducted by the Buni-led national executive, whose legal status, in the face of section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC constitution, has been queried by the Supreme Court, could extort from their innocent followers and subject them to a fraudulent exercise that is a nullity.\n\n\u201cWhile Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) bars a sitting governor from holding any other office while serving as state governor, Article 17(4) of the APC constitution clearly states that \u2018no officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position office in government concurrently,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PDP explained that the implication was that with Buni as chairman, the APC has no valid national executive and as such any congress or any other statutory process conducted by the APC under this circumstance remained a nullity.\n\n\u201cOur party, therefore, counsels those who participated in the ridiculous drama called APC ward congress to know that they have been viciously scammed. They should not worsen their situation by allowing the deceptive APC leaders to further set them against one another in bloody clashes for a party that has technically gone defunct,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nBut the National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement issued yesterday said, instead of being humbled by the defeat of the recent Supreme Court judgement on the Ondo Governorship election, the PDP has turned itself to an interpreter of law.\n\n\u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is an old, lonely, toothless and hungry Hyena wandering aimlessly in the jungle of political wilderness. Nigerians are fully aware of its antecedents and will never take it seriously no matter how much empty noise it makes.\n\n\u201cWe note how arrogantly the PDP has become an interpreter of the laws of the nation by ignorant comments on the recent Supreme Court judgement, which affirmed the election victory of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, and dismissed the PDP\u2019s case on the grounds that it was incompetent,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe noted that the PDP had reached the end of its political road and Nigerians would never trust it again with the governance of this country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A United Kingdom High Court of Justice, Strand, London, (Queen\u2019s Bench Division) has set aside the judgment received by the General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Dr Daniel Olukoya, in a case against a Nigerian blogger, Maureen Badejo, over alleged defamation.\n\nAccording to the court order obtained by SaharaReporters, the UK judge in his judgment set aside the March 30, 2021, judgment by a High Court of Justice in Ogun State of Nigeria in proceedings numbered AB/407/2020 obtained by Olukoya.\n\nThe judge also on July 28 ordered the claimant, Olukoya, to pay \u00a350.00 within 14 days to Badejo as application fees.\n\nThe judge said, \u201cUpon the application of the Defendant, AND UPON hearing the solicitor for the Claimants and the Defenfdant in person, IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n\n\u201cThe registration orders each dated 30 March 2021 in respect of the judgment dated 9 February 2021 of the High Court of Justice of the Ogun State of Nigeria in proceedings numbered AB/407/2020 as a judgment in the Queen Bench Division of the High Court of Justice are set aside.\n\n\u201cThe Claimant shall pay the Defendant cost of the application assessed at \u00a350.00 within 14 days.\u201d\n\nIn February 2021, the Ogun State High Court had ordered Badejo to pay N500million to Olukoya for defamation.\n\nAbiodun Akinyemi, while delivering the judgment, had also ordered Badejo, the proprietor of Gio TV, to pull down and erase the offending online publications concerning the claimants from the internet.\n\nBut the UK court set aside the rulings in a july 28 court judgment sent to SaharaReporters.\n\nThe UK ruling came a few weeks after a United States District Court in California also struck out a case by Olukoya against the blogger.\n\nThe US Court in the case Number 20-cv-08001-HSG also gave an order \u201cdenying motion for default judgment\u201d and it dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. See Also CRIME Mountain Of Fire And Miracles Overseer, Pastor Olukoya Loses Against Blogger, Maureen Badejo In US Court Over Defamation\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff (Olukoya) filed a motion for entry of default on February 3, 2021, and entry of default was noticed by the Clerk on February 4, 2021. At the initial case management conference on February 16, 2021, the Court expressed to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel concern that the Court lacked subject matter and personal jurisdiction over this matter.\n\n\u201cThe Counsel responded that he would consult with his clients to either file a notice of dismissal or a motion for default judgment that set out the basis for the Court to exercise jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cOn March 9, 2021, a letter from Ms. Badejo was entered into the docket in which she stated that she is a permanent resident of the United Kingdom and that she disputes the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over her. Plaintiffs filed the currently pending motion for default judgment,\u201d the court document reads.\n\nIn the judgment delivered on May 6, the US District judge, Haywood Gilliam, stated that the plaintiffs\u2019 (Olukoya and MFM) motion for default judgment is denied and the case is dismissed.\n\nThe judge had said, \u201cIn determining whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is proper, a district court must apply the law of the state in which it sits when there is no applicable federal statute governing personal jurisdiction. District courts in California may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the extent permitted by the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe party seeking to invoke jurisdiction has the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists. Here, Plaintiffs offer no argument that the Court has general personal jurisdiction over Defendants and allege no facts to establish that Defendants\u2019 contacts with California are 'substantial' or 'continuous and systematic.' Plaintiffs allege only that Ms. Badejo is a Nigerian-born blogger who resides in the United Kingdom; that she operates an online news site, Defendant Gio TV, with an emphasis on Nigeria; and that this online news site is accessible on Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram.\n\n\u201cTheir allegations are insufficient to establish general personal jurisdiction over Defendants. Plaintiffs thus fail to show that Defendants directly targeted California with their conduct and therefore cannot satisfy the express-aiming element of the Calder effects test, which is required to establish the first element of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Court finds that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants. Conclusion - Because the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for default judgment is denied, and the case is dismissed. The Clerk is directed to terminate the case. It is so ordered.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Badejo was accused of using her social media channels to blackmail Olukoya and his church on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.\n\nShe claimed that Olukoya and his church, the claimants, duped the United States Government by selling his books in the US without paying due tax.\n\nThe blogger also alleged that a pastor from MFM in the UK paid \u00a3150,000 into the personal account of Olukoya and then went to Nigeria to meet the cleric so he could help him cover up his fraud.",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

It also plans to launch new product offerings for its Nigerian market.\n\nThe funding was made at a $500 million evaluation and comes after raising a $25 million Series A in March 2021 and a $10 million seed round in November 2020. With a $1.6 million pre-seed raise in September 2019 and a $15,000 pre-seed in 2018, its total raise comes to $91.6 million.\n\nThe round was co-led by previous investors, Valar Ventures and Target Global. Other investors that participated include Japan-based Strategic Business Investor (SBI) Investment and past angel investors.\n\nIncorporated in 2018 as Kudimoney, the company changed its name to Kuda just before its $1.6 million raise in 2019. The company is the brainchild of co-founders Babs Ogundeyi and Musty Mustapha, CTO, and was founded as a lending platform before transitioning into a digital bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKuda now has 1.4 million registered users \u2014 more than double the number it had in March when it had 650,000 registered users.\n\nPer TechCrunch, this Series B round was relatively fast as the company was not actively looking to raise money.\n\n\u201cWe felt that Babs and Musty are ambitious on another level. For them, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,\u201d said Ricardo Sch\u00e4fer, Partner at Target Global.\n\nAccording to Ogundeyi, Kuda\u2019s initial business model was built around providing banking services to people who still held accounts with incumbent banks. But this is gradually shifting as more people are paying in and out of their accounts.\n\nAlthough he does not state the countries where Kuda would launch, he hints that its latest product, the Kuda Bank Overdraft is a sign of things to come.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique product, an overdraft that we pre-qualify the most active users for,\u201d he said. In Q2, it qualified over 200,000 users and pushed out $20 million worth of credit. With a 30-day repayment, he said, so far, default has been \u201cminimal\u201d because of the company\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cWe use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer\u2019s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,\u201d he added.\n\nAndrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures, says, \u201cKuda is our first investment in Africa, and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda\u2019s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting them,\u201d he concludes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu who addressed journalists in Benin City, on the performance of Adegoke noted that if not for the bad luck that hit the athlete, he was on the path to claim a medal for Nigeria at the event.\n\nHe said despite the outcome of the race in the final, the Edo State Government will give Adegoke a red-carpet reception when he returns to the country as he is a worthy ambassador of Edo State.\n\nShaibu said, \u201cEdo people are very proud of the performance of Enoch Adegoke. He was a medal hopeful until that muscle pull. The incident in the final was unfortunate as his takeoff was very good just about 40 to 50 meters before the bad luck in the game caught up with him. We will celebrate with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is to bring him back home as our ambassador and prepare him for other future activities and also check his medical condition to ensure in future events he doesn\u2019t suffer such ill luck.\u201d\n\nHe added that lack of preparation has a lot of impact on the performance of Nigerian athletes which include Enoch Adegoke as they all depended on the goodwill of spirited Nigerians to embark on their training, noting that Edo State also gave their support.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at this level today because we have reduced sports to politics. We are proud of Enoch Adegoke who made us proud in Tokyo following his outstanding performance in the race until the muscle pull stole the show from him in the final of the 100m mens final,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

But unfortunately, we have not been able to get any conviction.

Joseph Iduoriyekemwen J.P., Elder Victor Aigbe, Elder O. Igbinidu, Monday Iduoriyekemwen and Elder John Eware, the community said the land was dubiously taken from the community some time ago by Ize-Iyamu.\n\nAccording to the community, \u201cWe, the indigenes of Amagba Community in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State, wish to express our appreciation to Governor Godwin Obaseki for listening and hearkening to our pleas expressed in the various protest letters written to him on the injustice and oppression meted on us by Osagie Ize-Iyamu.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are indeed grateful for the Governor\u2019s intervention and move to revoke the Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) on a land measuring over 18 hectares, which was dubiously taken from us some time ago by the said individual.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWe hereby state, without equivocation that the said expanse of land, amounting to over 18 hectares did not wholly belong to Ize-Iyamu because portions of it were allocated to other individuals.\n\n\u201cThe portion of the land within the 18 hectares to which Ize-Iyamu laid claim, hitherto awarded to him by the community, has since been revoked by the people and leaders of Amagba, after several letters by the people and a final letter written to him by the legal representative of the Amagba Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a community, we decided to withdraw the large expanse of land over which Ize-Iyamu sat, under the guise of setting up an Agricultural Institution to create jobs as well as open up the area for increased economic activities,\u201d they added.\n\nThe community accused Ize-Iyamu of employing deceit when acquiring the land, noting, \u201cIt turned out that Ize-Iyamu only used the proposed agricultural institution to deceitfully acquire the land from the community, because in fact, there has never been any activity on the said parcel for these many years: Rather, the place, having been left unused, has become a den of criminals, posing severe security and safety threat to women, children and the entire people of Amagba Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that, even before the community began to solicit the intervention of the governor, several engagements have been ongoing to draw Ize-Iyamu\u2019s attention to the need to vacate the said property, having failed to put it to use for the purpose for which it was allocated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have, over the years, endured the pain and agony of the domination of Mr. Ize-Iyamu, who has depended on his political clout and connection with successive governments, to deprive us of the purposeful use of our land and also put our lives in danger, having left such a vast land unused in the midst of a thriving community, thereby making the land a cover for armed robbers, rapists, hoodlums, among others,\u201d they said.\n\nThey praised the governor for his decision, adding, \u201cWe are therefore immensely grateful to his Excellency, Mr. Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki, for his intervention in revoking the land title and opening up opportunities for the land to be used by government to advance the development of Amagba community and its environs.\n\n\u201cThe people of Amagba also acknowledge the numerous developmental projects embarked upon by the Governor in our community, including the over 15km Ugbor-Amagba Road, which has since been completed, as well as several other adjoining roads that have been constructed. We, once more, reaffirm our unflinching support for the Governor for his interest in the development of Amagba Community and appeal that these efforts be sustained.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "UPDATED: Nigeria confirms COVID-19 3rd wave as Lagos records six deaths daily from disease",
          "text": "The Nigerian government has officially confirmed that the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic is already in the country.\n\nBoth the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the health minister, Osagie Ehanire, made the disclosure at different events on Monday evening.\n\nMr Sanwo-Olu also announced that since last week, an average of six deaths have been recorded daily from the disease in the country\u2019s commercial city and coronavirus epicentre.\n\nIn his address at the national briefing by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19, Mr Ehanire confirmed that like in many other parts of Africa, Nigeria has \u201cbegun to record a sharp increase in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases since the month of July, as global anxiety over the Delta variant spreads.\u201d\n\nHe said; \u201cAll data indicate that we are now no doubt in the third wave of resurgence of the SARS-COV-2 infection, which we saw coming long ago.\u201d\n\nCorroborating the minister, Mr Sanwo-Olu in a statement personally signed by him, a copy of which PREMIUM TIMES obtained, noted that despite efforts to prevent the third wave from hitting Nigeria, the third wave has already arrived.\n\n\u201cThe third wave is already here with us, as much as we would have wished for a more positive outcome. We do not have a choice than to tackle it. We are no longer inexperienced, as a people, in dealing with the Coronavirus. Eighteen months into the pandemic, we have learnt a lot, we have seen progress and setbacks, we have been able to finetune our strategies and response, and we are now in a good place to ensure that this third wave is the final one. I believe that we can close this pandemic chapter very soon. But we must put in the work, the compliance, the regard for rules and restrictions,\u201d the governor wrote.\n\nGiving the statistics, Mr Sanwo-Olu said since the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, Lagos has recorded a total of 64,032 infections with 56,336 recovering in-community.\n\nHe, however, noted that currently, a total of 2,755 cases are being managed actively in-community while 5,029 cases have been admitted into the state\u2019s coronavirus care centres.\n\nOn the fatality recorded, he said; \u201cWe have, sadly, recorded 390 fatalities in Lagos State, 30 of which have taken place in this current 3rd wave of the pandemic. Essentially, we have recorded on average 6 deaths per day since last week.\u201d\n\nThird wave versus doctors\u2019 strike\n\nThe confirmation of the third wave comes on the same day doctors who are members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) commenced a nationwide industrial action.\n\nThe strike, which according to the doctors became inevitable over unpaid salaries and poor welfare, among other demands, has paralysed activities in many tertiary hospitals across the country, especially in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Lagos State.\n\nThus, with the confirmation of the third wave, the strike will further compound the woes bedevilling the nation\u2019s already overwhelmed healthcare sector.\n\nBut the health minister said talks are currently ongoing between the government and the striking doctors, saying the government was optimistic of an amicable resolution soon.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health is engaging resident doctors who have embarked on industrial action with a view to quickly resolving the issues. While this is ongoing, medical directors at federal and state hospitals are directed to ensure that service delivery is not disrupted in their centres,\u201d Mr Ehanire said.\n\nIncreased Delta variant cases\n\nAt the briefing, the chairman of the PSC, Boss Mustapha, said all countries in the West African region are beginning to see the 3rd Wave and that Nigeria already recorded about 500 cases daily in the last seven days.\n\nMr Mustapha, who doubles as the secretary to the government of the federation, explained that six states are experiencing a surge in the highly transmissible Delta variant, which he noted accounts for the rising cases in the country.\n\nHe added that Lagos State accounts for over 50 per cent of the cases.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe PSC is concerned about the situation in Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Oyo, Rivers, FCT and Plateau States as the delta variant has made its way into these states and accounts for the rising cases in these states and across the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mr Mustapha noted that the country\u2019s test positivity ratio has increased to about 6 per cent, Mr Sanwo-Olu noted that it is 8.9 per cent in Lagos as of August 2, 2021.\n\nSome of the above listed states were earlier placed on red alert by the Nigerian government.\n\nLagos, the epicentre\n\nIn his statement, Mr Sanwo-Olu reeled out the strategies to combat the virus, insisting that the war against the pandemic is a familiar one and that the people should not panic.\n\nHe said; \u201cWe have done it before and we can do it again. We dealt with the first and second waves and did our best to prevent a third wave.\n\n\u201cNow that it is fully upon us, we must dig deep into what we have learnt from the previous waves, as well as summon the will to do everything necessary to bring down the numbers, on the way to eventually defeating the virus once and for all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on vaccination, the governor lamented that only 1 per cent of the state\u2019s residents have received two doses of vaccines.\n\nHe said his administration is working hard towards ensuring that at least 60 per cent of the residents are duly vaccinated, noting that \u201cexperience from other regions of the world shows that majority of the confirmed cases that have resulted in death were in unvaccinated persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why we are seriously looking to scale up vaccination coverage for our people,\u201d he said.\n\nOn protocol defaulters\n\nWhile the federal government said it is prepared to publish the names of about 500 travellers who defaulted the COVID-19 protocols within the last few days, the Lagos governor said the punitive measures taken against defaulters have informed increased compliance to the mandatory isolation protocols.\n\nMr Mustapha, while speaking on the matter, said some of the defaulters who have had their passports seized would only have them released after six months while the non-Nigerians are currently facing more serious punishments.\n\nBoth the governor and the federal government officials, however, pleaded with Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike to always observe the protocols, noting that everyone should be responsible in their conducts.\n\n\u201cI would like to implore all primary, secondary, and tertiary educational institutions to cooperate with the officials from the state ministries of health and education to ensure the safety of all the people in their care. There is currently an influx of school students who are on summer vacation into Nigeria. If not properly handled, this could be an amplifying factor for the third wave we are already experiencing in Nigeria,\u201d Mr Sanwo-Olu advised.\n\nOn vaccination\n\nThe federal government explained that the newly donated four million doses of Moderna vaccines are currently being assessed by the National Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and would soon be distributed to states when approved for use.\n\nOn his part, the executive director and chief executive officer of Nigeria\u2019s National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, said the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, had, ahead of the arrival of the vaccines, purchased 60 ultra-cold chain equipment and have since allocated one to each of the 36 states for safe storage of the vaccines.\n\nAnd speaking on whether those who took the first dose of the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccines could take from the Moderna types, Mr Shuaib said; \u201cThat is not the recommendation of the WHO and that is not what we are going to be doing in Nigeria. For those who have taken the first dose of Astrazeneca, we are expecting in a week or so additional consignment of Astrazeneca vaccines that we will give as second doses.\u201d\n\nOn diplomatic issues\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, acknowledged the recent issues with some diplomats arriving in the country and reeled out the conditions to be observed by diplomats from various countries.\n\nHe said those from the four restrictive countries of South Africa, Turkey, Brazil and India have specific conditions to meet while those from other countries are also expected to meet other conditions.\n\nHe, however, said some categories of diplomats from the two categorised countries are also entitled to waivers which he noted can only be granted by the PSC.\n\nHe emphasised the need for PSR test results and the need for mandatory seven-day isolation for those coming from other countries while those from the four restrictive countries or those who may have visited them 14 days prior to the visit to Nigeria should pass through stricter protocols.",

I\u2019m the only one who can help you,\u2019 and all these things to divert the job for himself.\n\n\u201cAfter listening to the message, Kyari wrote, \u201cOk I understand. But he has not succeeded.\u201d Abbas claimed Chibuzo had taken some money, and provided Kyari with two screenshots, one of which contained the phone number 3054405586 (the phone number Chibuzo used to contact the Victim Businessperson).\n\n\u201cAbbas then told Kyari, \u2018Now the [Victim Businessperson] was skeptic to pay me the money cos he keep attacking the [Victim Businessperson] from his end. Now I can handle the [Victim Businessperson] correctly.\u201d\n\nThe document further alleged that \u201cAbbas further told Kyari that he wanted to pay money to send Chibuzo to jail for a long time, stating, \u2018Please sir, I want to spend money to send this boy to jail, let him go for a very long time.\u2019\n\n\u201cKyari responded, \u201cOk bro, I understand; I will discuss with my team who arrested him . . .

          "text": "HURIWA, the Nigerian Human Rights Writers Association, has petitioned the United Nations Human Rights Council to sanction Nigeria for flagrant violations of media workers\u2019 human rights.\n\nThe UNURC\u2019s classification of Nigeria\u2019s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) should be downgraded, according to the rights group, as a global sanction for President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s habit of physically brutalizing media workers and administratively hindering the enjoyment of press freedoms and freedom of expression in Nigeria.\n\nHURIWA expressed disappointment that the UNHRC acts as if Nigerians are less significant in terms of the universality of the fundamental human rights reflected by international declarations of human rights, despite the fact that it is clear that President Buhari has crippled the NHRC\u2019s operational independence.\n\n\u201cWe think the UN Human Rights system is racist because how else do you explain this inequality and neglect of the crackdown of media workers happening in Nigeria but yet the British Government continues to dine and wine with the rapidly emerging dictator in Abuja who keeps globetrotting?\u201d\n\nHURIWA expressed its regret in a media statement issued by the National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, and the National Director of Media Affairs, Miss Zainab Yusuf, that security forces use physical torture and brute force on a daily basis to stop and prevent media practitioners from exercising their rights under section 22 of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cNo day passes without reports of arrests or physical brutalization of Journalists by the Department of State Service (DSS) or the police just as there have been attempts even by the Federal High Court in criminal collusion with the security forces to bar Independent Journalists from covering litigation of public importance.\n\n\u201cOver a dozen Journalists have been killed by police attempting to quell peaceful protests just as these media workers are only just doing their duty as permitted by the Grund Norm.\n\n\u201cWe totally condemn these systematic clamp down on Journalists. We condemn President Muhammadu Buhari for escalating attacks against the citizen\u2019 enjoyment of freedoms of expression including the illegal ban imposed on the use of Twitter for over a month.\n\n\u201cThere are scores of attacks against citizens for posting comments considered damaging to the reputation of political office holders and governors and there are another dozens of Nigerians who are languishing in jails over media rights related issues.\u201d\n\nHURIWA recalled that on July 28, 2021 operatives of the DSS at Mpape Magistrate Court, Abuja, harassed a journalist with online medium, Premium Times, Ameh Ekwonyilo, for taking the pictures of five activists arrested at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre for wearing T-Shirts with the inscription #BuhariMustGo.\n\n\u201cThe reporter, who was in court to cover the proceedings of the trial of the activists, was harassed and had his mobile phone seized by the gun-wielding officers who were stationed within the premises,\u201d the group added.\n\n\u201cThen on July 26, 2021 there was heavy security presence at the Federal High Court in Abuja preparatory to the arrival of the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, for continuation of his trial on treasonable felony charge.\n\n\u201cArmed security operatives, mainly from the DSS have barricaded all access routes to the court premises which is beside the Federal Ministry of Justice,\u201d the group further recalled.\n\nThe operatives, HURIWA said, blatantly refused to allow this reporter access to the court premises, insisting that only media outlets in a list that was handed to them, would be allowed to enter the court premises.\n\nAgain HURIWA said that on 11th June 2021 the operatives of the DSS and some policemen, yesterday, descended on a reporter with the Punch newspaper, Friday Olokor. The journalist, who was to cover a panel of discussants at the ongoing African Council of Women Conference in Abuja, was brutalised and had his clothes torn by the security men on duty.\n\nOn July 30, 2021 in the North Eastern state of Bauchi, HURIWA recalled that the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has directed all media organizations in Bauchi state to suspend coverage of all police activities in the state after an assault on a journalist in an event in the state metropolis.\n\nThe Union of media workers HURIWA said, while reacting to an attack on the reporter of Africa Independent Television (AIT) in Bauchi, Nagari Damina Yusuf by the Police Special Squad at his duty post, gave the directive in a press release signed by the State Chairman Umar Sa\u2019id and Secretary Isah Garba Gadau and issued at the end of its emergency meeting on Friday.",

          "text": "Forty four years after its establishment, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Monday announced plans to declare its first dividends to Nigeria.\n\nGroup Managing Director Mele Kyari stated this while speaking at the 2021 edition of the Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition (NAICE) organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) in Lagos.\n\nThe conference was themed: \u201cThe Future of Energy: A Trilogy of Climate Change, Public Health & Global Oil Market.\u201d\n\nHe said the corporation\u2019s 2020 financial statements to be released in the third quarter of this year would come with unprecedented news.\n\nHe said: \u201cEverything we are doing must align with the wider national interest. And therefore, NNPC, being the representatives of all of us and, is, of course, a very potential global player \u2013 this is our ambition and we are getting there.\n\n\u201cAnd I can tell you, within the next month or two maximum, we will publish our statement of accounts for 2020. And I can also confirm to you that for the first time in our history, we will declare dividend to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nKyari said the corporation would play a key role in the global transition to low carbon energy in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe are deepening natural gas utilisation under the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP) to earn more carbon credit and create a net zero carbon environment in line with our drive of becoming energy company of global excellence.\n\n\u201cNNPC is currently extending natural gas infrastructure backbone through the OB3 and AKK gas pipelines to deepen domestic gas utilization, support industrial growth and job creation.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to take the right quantities of gas to every part of Nigeria at the right quality and the right price.\n\n\u201cNNPC is leveraging technology to achieve better systems and processes optimization to support performance, accountability and value creation that exceeds the simple fulfilment of our business mandates,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, looking at climate and population change dynamics, anticipated economic growth and rising global population especially in Asia and Africa will obviously increase energy consumption beyond what renewable energy sources can meet by 2050.\n\n\u201cBuilding on this convergence, Nigeria as a key player in global energy security is addressing its challenges mainly fiscal, security and cost competitiveness to stimulate investments in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cNNPC as a National Oil company is leading multiple initiatives to address this and other issues.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the passage of the PIB, we have moved our focus to improving security architecture through collaboration with major stakeholders. NUCOP is working with operators and service contractors to challenge cost of operations and increase profitability and growth in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cIndustry conversations are dominated by the shift to renewable energy as a source of cleaner and climate-friendly fuel,\u201d Kyari added.\n\nHe also told the gathering that oil demand was rising and prices had gone up to pre-pandemic levels, averaging $74/bbl; as countries gradually overcome the pandemic shocks and economies re-open.\n\n..Lists conditions for oil majors\u2019 divestment\n\nThe NNPC boss listed various issues that needed to be exhaustively addressed before Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and other oil majors begin divestment of their investments in Nigeria following a growing appetite for cleaner and more environmentally-friendly energy.\n\nThis, he said, was necessary to avoid fracturing the Nigerian economy in hurried exodus.\n\nTo this end, the national oil company said special attention would be paid to abandonment and relinquishment costs; severance of operator staff; third party contract liabilities; competency of the buyer; post purchased technical, operational, and financial capabilities, especially in the era of activist investor\u2019s sentiments against funding of fossil fuel projects and alignment with Nigeria national strategic interest.\n\nKyari said the NNPC would soon unveil a Comprehensive Divestment Policy (CDP) that would guide the entire divestment process.\n\nHe said while the NNPC partners reserved the right to divest their interests, the national oil company also has a duty to provide clear-cut guidelines and criteria for such divestment to guarantee a win-win situation for all parties.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a wave of divestment by oil majors operating Nigeria. NNPC as a national oil company cannot stop partners from divesting their interest, even though it creates a challenge for us in ensuring that we get right and competent investors to take position and add value to the assets.\n\n\u201cNNPC will ensure that Nigeria\u2019s National strategic interest is safeguarded, by developing a Comprehensive Divestment Policy,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nIn subsequent deals, the NNPC boss said, the corporation would tweak its rules of engagement by making clear distinctions between divestment of shares and operatorship agreements under various joint operating agreements, while leveraging its rights of pre-emption as well as evaluating the operational competency and track records of new partners.\n\nHe said the imperatives of energy transition and the influence of activist investors on the global energy industry were making oil and gas companies diversify their portfolio to low-carbon investments by whetting the appetite for investment in cleaner energy sources like; wind, solar, hydrogen, natural gas and bio-fuels.\n\nKyari said the new energy sources have obvious wider business implications on the oil and gas industry.\n\nIn view of this, the NNPC boss advised \u201coil-dependent economies to brace up for the bumpy ride ahead, as the global transition to non-fossil sources of energy will mean declining revenue, foreign exchange and weaker funding of projects particularly in the context of green finance and activist investor\u2019s action on the boards of major oil companies and global financial institutions.\u201d\n\nExperts react, laud NNPC\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview with Blueprint, a political economist and development researcher, Mr Adefolarin Olamilekan, urged Nigerians to interrogate the statement by the NNPC boss on announcing dividend 44 years after operation.\n\nHe said the statement was an attempt by the NNPC management to take Nigerians for granted and \u201cplay on our collective intelligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecently, the national oil management body cried of bleeding from unsustainable subsidy payment, loss of oil revenues due to pipeline vandalism, the shrinking oil price at the international market affecting projected inflow of profit and many sundry challenges posed by the current Kyari-led NNPC. So for every concerned and right thinking person, there are reasons to interrogate what is really happening to the monies generated by NNPC.\n\n\u201cFor the interest of the Nigerian people, whatever comes out the audited account of NNPC would not change their perception about the corporation as long as the four national refineries remain a site for monument and a cesspool of salaries and allowance for unproductive workers,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking to our reporter, MD/CEO SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade said it was important that the books of NNPC were examined to ascertain the reporting system to the government and the public were in order.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NNPC has been reporting consistent losses for the past years since the time the agency decided to make its finances public. However, we cannot rule out investment in gas, Joint Venture and in other subsidiaries that could have started churning out profit for the agency.\n\n\u201cThere is also a possibility that increased transparency is now being practiced by NNPC management and the declarations from October will be a fair and actual position of affairs of the agency.\n\n\u201cFinally, when NNPC starts declaring dividends, then it has joined its counterparts in other countries that have been efficiently and effectively managed and have been profitable,\u201d Idakolo further said.\n\nBut going forward, Adefolarin urged President Muhammadu Buhari to assent the PIB, saying it would ensure transparency in the management of the NNPC.\n\n\u201cTime has come to operationalise another model with approaches that would guarantee openness, transparency, and accountability in the nation\u2019s oil and gas corporation,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Stakeholders of the ICT sector in West Africa have agreed to embrace the universality of the internet with the aim of deepening internet penetration across the region and ensuring safe internet.\n\nUNESCO and the African ICT Foundation jointly organized a knowledge-sharing session on how to mainstream Internet Universality and ROAM principles (Rights, Openness, Access, and Multi-stakeholder approach).\n\nThe session, which was held on the occasion of the West African Internet Governance Forum 2021, focused on how to encourage more countries to use ROAM-X indicators for improving national Internet development and digital policies in West Africa.\n\nThe session was moderated by Dr. Kossi Amessinou, who underlined the main objective to engage an extended partnership with the Internet community of West Africa by mobilizing them to participate in Dynamic Coalition and provide the necessary tools to conduct national assessments in all ECOWAS countries.\n\nOur work on Internet Universality seeks to identify and close digital divides, foster digital inclusion, protect rights including freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy, as well as to contribute to strengthening resilience and development.\n\nMarielza Oliveira, UNESCO\u2019s Director for Partnerships and Operational Programme Monitoring Tony Ojobo, President of the African ICT Foundation commended the collaboration with UNESCO and highlighted the need to carry out periodic evaluations in African countries to enable the improvement of national Internet governance.\n\nThe ROAM principles and indicators go beyond the traditional rationale of physical access. They contribute to comprehensively advancing digital inclusion, focusing on multiple dimensions of human rights, open Internet, quality of access, and inclusive multi-stakeholder governance for building resilient West Africa and achieving SDGs.\n\nDorothy Gordon, Chair of UNESCO\u2019 Information for All Programme, reaffirmed the need for strong advocacy from national and regional stakeholders to implement the national assessment of IUIs across the West-African countries. She further called for more engagement from civil society to represent vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as disabled people, women, or the youth.\n\nProfessor Alain Kiyindou pointed out that the assessment of the ROAM-X indicators in countries like Benin and Niger offers tremendous opportunities to push forward the development of the Internet in West Africa. This framework empowers national stakeholders to gain a better understanding of their digital landscape and engage in the digital transformation and inclusion process.\n\nRepresenting Development House, Kafui Aheto introduced the initial findings of the ongoing national assessment of ROAM-X indicators in Ghana. He highlighted the importance of multi-stakeholders in guiding the overall assessment process and building policy development in Ghana.\n\nROAM-X indicators assessments have been progressing in 28 countries, including the following African countries: Benin, Senegal, Kenya, Ghana, Niger, Ethiopia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Cabo Verde, Burkina Faso. All participants agreed on the importance for African countries to mainstream ROAM principles and the urgent need to expand advocacy, capacity-building, resource mobilization, and multistakeholder partnerships to scale up national assessment projects across the region.\n\nUNESCO encourages all countries in the West-African sub-region to continue using the ROAM framework and join the Dynamic Coalition on Internet Universality Indicators (IUIs) to bring the Internet forward in the region.",

(Delta) variant has become a major source of worry in recent times as a result of its rapid increase in several countries, including the United States.\n\nREAD ALSO: Sanwo-Olu Raises Alarm Over COVID-19 Third Wave, Warns Erring Foreigners Of Sanctions\n\nNigeria is not left out.

The country has not recorded fewer than 500 cases daily for the past seven days.\n\nMustapha, who is also worried about the increased prevalence of the Delta variant in the states of concern, said the alarming single-day figures have shown an increased test positivity ratio of about six per cent.\n\nHe hinted that the PSC would publish the names of over 500 travellers who have violated the travel protocol and those who evaded quarantine.\n\nNigeria had commenced vaccination with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines, but Nigerians are set to get doses of a different product \u2013 Moderna.\n\nThe Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, has assured Nigerians that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is very effective, with up to 74 per cent efficacy against the Delta variant.\n\nHe, however, cautioned against mixing and matching COVID-19 vaccines, saying conversations were ongoing about the safety or efficacy of doing so.\n\nAccording to the NPHCDA boss, another batch is expected in the country in the next few weeks to ensure the continued administration of the vaccine to those that have received the first jab.",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has raised an alarm over the increasing figure of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the state and warned foreigners who violate guidelines that they risk deportation.\n\nAt a press briefing on Monday, the governor called on residents to adhere strictly to the guidelines put in place to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nLagos State, the epicenter of the pandemic in Nigeria has witnessed a rise in positivity rate; from 1.1 percent at the start of July to seven percent by the time the month ended.\n\nThis has left the Governor worried.\n\n\u201cAs of August 1, 2021, the positivity rate in Lagos is 8.9 per cent. This is an eight-fold increase over the recorded figure a month ago, and it should rightly alarm all of us,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in 4,300 confirmed cases in July alone and 352 admissions into our isolation facilities.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu believes everyone should be concerned about the rising cases, but he does not want people to panic.\n\nInstead, he expects them to approach the situation \u201cwith a firm resolve and determination to reverse the trend\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have done it before and we can do it again,\u201d he said.\n\nSix Deaths Per Day\n\nThe third wave of the pandemic has no doubt hit Lagos State proper and while it has not been as disruptive as the first and second waves, it has led to the reintroduction of restrictions and forced the management of the University of Lagos to send students home.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu admitted that the state was already in the third wave of the pandemic but he believes previous experiences battling the disease will help the state prevail over it.\n\nTo achieve that objective, according to him, the state and its resident will have to dig deep and summon the will to do everything necessary.\n\nFrom the start of the outbreak in February 2020, Lagos has recorded a total of 64,032 confirmed COVID-19 cases, out of which 56,336 have recovered and 2,755 being managed actively in the community.\n\n\u201cWe have, sadly, recorded 390 fatalities in Lagos State, 30 of which have taken place in this current third wave of the pandemic. Essentially, we have recorded on average six deaths per day since last week,\u201d the governor said.\n\nOver the course of managing the pandemic, about 5,029 patients have been admitted into various care centers in the state.\n\nVaccination has played a crucial part in the battle against the pandemic and Nigeria has not been left out.\n\nIn Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu said 404,414 people and 243,374 residents have received both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nWith an estimated 21 million residents in the state, the Governor is worried that just one per cent of residents have received both COVID-19 jabs, considering that the state was already confronted by a third wave.\n\nTo better the statistics, he said the government would explore all avenues possible to ramp up access to vaccination, so as to attain its herd immunity target of administering vaccines to at least 60 per cent of the population.\n\nDefaulting Passengers Risk Deportation\n\nA major obstacle to the race to end the pandemic is compliance with guidelines and protocols and the governor is taking a tough position when it comes to violations.\n\nHe warned returning passengers from red-listed countries \u2013 India, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey \u2013 to observe protocols including mandatory isolation or risk sanctions.\n\nAnyone caught breaching the isolation protocols would be subjected to a host of sanctions and penalties, including fines and possible prosecution under the public health laws, the governor warned.\n\nAlready, he said, the state was preparing a list of absconders that would be sent to the Presidential Steering Committee and the Lagos State Ministry of Justice.\n\nAccording to the governor, defaulting foreigners risk revocation of their permanent residency and deportation while erring Nigerians will be duly prosecuted.\n\nMeanwhile, the vaccination drive received a boost on Monday as the Federal Government received over four million doses of Moderna vaccine donated by the United States Government.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectation that as the epicentre of the epidemic, Lagos State will receive a sizeable amount of this allocation,\u201d Governor Sanwo-Olu said, commending the US for the donation.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine cannot be mixed with the AstraZeneca vaccine, so it will only be for people that have not been previously vaccinated. We are still expecting the second allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and will inform you when it is received.\u201d",

For those who have taken the first dose of AstraZeneca, we are expecting in a week or so additional consignment of Astrazeneca vaccines that we will give as second doses.\u201d\n\nHe added that the country is expecting about 700,000 doses in the coming week and another 4.9 million doses by mid-August.\n\n\u201cWe now have a large menu that Nigerians can choose from,\u201d he said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden had in May, pledged to share 80 million vaccines produced in the country with countries around the world especially Africa to protect the most vulnerable and stem transmission of the coronavirus.\n\nOf the 80 million doses, Africa is expected to receive 25 million, with the first shipments to Burkina Faso, Djibouti, and Ethiopia which had already been delivered.",

The Commission has affiliate status with the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights. These give the Commission access to all necessary meetings at the UN and AU Levels. This is indeed gratifying and it beholds on the Governing Council to uphold and improve on the standard achieved by the previous Councils and the Management of the Commission before now.\u201d\n\nThe Council Chairperson, Dr. Salamatu Suleiman in her address said nations are judged by their human rights record, even as she promised to brace up to the task before her Council.\n\nShe however appealed for improved welfare for the staff, insisting that it was unhealthy and something of shame for the staff of the Council to be poached by Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) because they are badly remunerated.\n\nIn his welcome speech, the Executive Secretary of the NHRC, Tony Ojukwu disclosed that the Commission and the Ministry of Justice is presently working with stakeholders to finalize the National Policy for the protection of civilians in armed conflict as well as the National Action Plan for the promotion and protection of human rights, which includes the new feature of the plan for business and human rights.\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe management and staff earnestly hope that the Council will continue to prioritize both the mandate and welfare of staff as both are intrinsically connected for the achievement of the objectives for which the Commission was set up by the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
