          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party has rejected the amended Electoral Act as passed by the National Assembly, calling it the \u201cmurder of democracy.\u201d\n\nThe National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus, said this in Abuja on Friday during a media briefing.\n\nAccording to Secondus, the National Assembly has turned its back on Nigerians by putting party interest before national interest.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe join our voices and anger with that of Nigerians and all lovers of democracy in condemning what happened in the National Assembly yesterday Thursday and today Friday.\n\n\u201cHow a representative of the people enjoying their mandate blatantly turned their back on them and toed the line of a political party interest that is clearly against the people.\n\n\u201cBy the choice of the All Progressives Congress to put party interest before national interest, they have vividly murdered democracy by the actions of their members in the two chambers of the National Assembly yesterday and today.\n\n\u201cFor us in PDP, today is a Black Friday for democracy.\u201d\n\nSecondus added that a free, fair and credible election was the tripod of any democracy, saying that the APC itself was a beneficiary of the Electoral Reform under the PDP administration.\n\n\u201cThe action of APC in swaying their members against the electronic transmission of election results clearly undermines and shows in unmistaken terms that APC is not ready to face the Nigerian electorate.\n\n\u201cIt also shows that the dilly-dallying of APC all the while in amending the Electoral Act is deliberate as they never wanted from inception to do anything that will deepen democracy in our country.\n\n\u201cThis is notwithstanding that the party is a huge beneficiary of Electoral Reform carried out by the PDP administration,\u201d he said.\n\nSecondus, therefore rejected the amended act and called on the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), to consider the move by the national assembly as a \u201cbig scam.\u201d\n\nHe added that the PDP would take every legal step to seek redress, calling on all lovers of democracy to \u201cstand up against this fraud.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

She precisely complained about her failure to buy monthly food items, which now occurs every two weeks or save from the allowances while expenses keep increasing.\n\nA trader in Lagos\u2019s Balogun Market was very specific as to fish, saying that the border closure affected his ability to supplement his fish stock, forcing him to raise prices for the increasingly scarce stock he has.\n\nMost of those interviewed in the low socio-economic echelons admitted they could no longer afford three square meals but had one whole meal daily supplemented with snacks.\n\nMrs Christiana, a Lagos housewife and entrepreneur disclosed she chose two-square meals daily, as allowances received can no longer afford her family decent three-meal days.\n\nAnother respondent who is a wife and mother of two at Sango-Ota, Ogun State, lamented the rapid escalation of prices of commodities in the market at Sango-Ota. She explained how she last went to the market and ended up confused about what exactly to buy since \u201cwhat N20,000 can but a few months back, today, N40,000 cannot afford the same.\u201d\n\nThe price of beans and garri in Sango-Ota rose by a significant 97.9%, which almost doubled within the period under review. Beans rose from N1,457 to N2,883 per four-litre paint rubber and garri saw a price rise from N869 to N1,856 per paint rubber. According to her, the price increases of these two staple foods were the highest in the last one year.\n\nIn Port Harcourt, a four-litre paint bucket of garri, which sold for N1,200 at the end of March, rose to N1,500 by June 2021, an increase of 25%. In the same period, a paint bucket of beans, which sold for N1,500, now sells for N1600.\n\nVisits to various markets revealed that in all the markets except in Onitsha, Port Harcourt and Calabar Municipal markets, the cost of making a pot of Jollof rice has skyrocketed. The decline in Anambra, Rivers and Cross River states was as a result of a slight reduction in the cost of beef, onions and tomatoes.",

          "text": "A few days back, someone on Nigerian Twitter asked if women would date a man who always moved around with a power bank. Seems like a harmless question, right? Well, that singular tweet snowballed into a denouncement of power banks and all who wielded it\u2014laughs in irregular power supply. Well, I wonder what they\u2019d say when they see Apple\u2019s new MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nAfter teasing us with the spanking new magsafe feature on its iPhone 12 series last year, Apple has finally launched the long-awaited MagSafe Battery Pack\u2014its wireless charging option. This exciting piece of hardware is currently available on the Apple website at $99 and is compatible with all iPhone 12 models.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nMagSafe Battery Pack Specs: the lowdown\n\nYes, yes, we know it sounds corny, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nThe MagSafe Battery pack sports a battery capacity of 1460mAh at 7.62V. Compared to other magsafe power banks, like Anker\u2019s PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless with its 5000mAh battery, Apple\u2019 new battery pack just doesn\u2019t cut it. Especially since the Anker option is a little above half of the Apple MagSafe price.\n\nHowever, the MagSafe may have some redeeming qualities.\n\nFor one, it is wireless, and has a slim, classy build\u2014way slimmer than the Anker option. That increases the cool factor and forgives the low battery capacity\u2014somewhat.\n\nIt also packs a charge. According to Apple Insider, the MagSafe Battery Pack might fully charge an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro with little issue. Though this depends on how much energy it wastes during charging\u2014wireless charging produces a lot of heat, and this reduces the charge.\n\nThe battery pack also has a reverse-charge feature. This means that not only can your plugged\u2014and attached\u2014MagSafe Battery charge your phone, you can also charge your attached MagSafe while your iPhone is plugged to a power supply.\n\nYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you\u2019re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac. If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging. \u2014 Apple Support\n\nFun fact: When connected to a 20W or higher power source, the MagSafe Battery can charge with up to 15W of power.\n\nYou can also see your charging status and battery pack percentage on your lockscreen when charging. However, your MagSafe-compatible iPhone should run the iOS 14.7 update or later.\n\nAre these features worth $99? You tell me.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, your date will probably not run when they see you with this stylish gear.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why food-on-demand can be Gokada\u2019s ticket to super app stardom",
          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks. That goes to demonstrate the appetite that is there.\u201d Mohamed added.\n\nAccording to Somalia\u2019s Central Bank Governor, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the Visa partnership will connect Somalia to the global financial system and show the growing confidence in the country\u2019s banking and finance sector.\n\nThe presence of both Mastercard and Visa in Somalia will help position its market as arable land ready to receive seed and produce a bounty harvest.\n\n\u201cWe plan to install an electronic verification system that will ease biometric identification of customers opening bank accounts or transacting in Somalia. We believe this will help to build international trust and confidence in transactions originating from Somalia to other financial markets,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nWith more partnerships like this, popular conversations around Somalia can increasingly focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.capetowndstvinstallation.com/\u201d>capetowndstvinstallation.com</a>\n\nWhat happened? Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has requested that the Federal Government enforce all antitrust laws against the satellite television sector due to the hike in digital TV subscription fees.\n\nWhat does this mean? The laws will keep PayTV services in check, regulate their prices, and reduce the possibility of any provider monopolising the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, the satellite TV sector is dominated by MultiChoice \u2014 the South African company that owns DStv and GOtv \u2014 and Chinese-owned StarTimes.\n\nA trigger? MultiChoice, the market leader, announced an increment in the price of some DStv packages in July 2018, after it did the same for all plans in September 2012 and May 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not all; there was another increase in May 2020, which the company blamed on the increased Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. At all these times, users and the government alike kicked against the hike.\n\nDespite the opposition, in July 2021, MultiChoice increased the monthly subscription fee of its DStv Compact Plus Package from \u20a610,650 ($25.88) to \u20a612,400 ($30.13).\n\nPer Premium Times, the need to break the satellite TV sector\u2019s monopoly was recognised following the adoption of the report of the ad-hoc committee investigating the non-implementation of pay-per-view rates.\n\nIt goes without saying that MultiChoice\u2019s DStv gets to be at the receiving end of any action resulting from that move.\n\nRecall last week, we reported that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) directed commercial banks to freeze MultiChoice Nigeria Limited and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nPer Vanguard, Nigeria contributes 34% of MultiChoice\u2019s total revenue, Kenya and Zambia contribute 11% and 10% respectively, while the rest of Africa contributes 45%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this goes to show how important the Nigerian market is to the company.\n\nHopefully, the antitrust laws, when enacted will enable more Nigerians to enjoy affordable payTV services.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAIfluence raises $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Thomas Ulrich from Pixabay\n\nKenyan adtech startup, AIfluence, has raised $1 million in seed investment to invest in its AI-powered influencer marketing platform.\n\nDubai-based EQ2 Ventures led the seed round, and Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office participated in the round.\n\nWhat about AIfluence? The adtech startup was founded by Nelson Aseka (CEO), George Issaias (CMO), Lamusia Anzaya (COO), and Ankit Jindal (CTO) in 2019. It was set up to accurately match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact.\n\nBuilt on a trust network model, the platform enables advertisers to recruit and manage hundreds to thousands of micro and nano influencers per campaign, resulting in authentic peer-to-peer interactions and higher conversion rates.\n\nHow does it make money? AIfluence generates revenue through brand initiatives that increase product and service awareness and lead generation and conversion campaigns that increase sales.\n\nThe company is currently developing a software as a service (SaaS) product that it claims will put the platform\u2019s power in the hands of its customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Apart from investing in AIfluence\u2019s technology and a SaaS platform, the funds will be used to grow into the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nRead more: Kenyan influencer marketing startup, AIfluence, nets $1m in seed funding for regional expansion\n\nPoS business in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Nigerian streets, urban and rural, have at least one kiosk, with most of them bearing variations of the phrase \u2018PoS is Available\u2019, meaning you can withdraw and send money there.\n\nThere are so many outlets because since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) launched the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy, the PoS business has proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie: Data released by Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nAlso, per Statista, the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019. On the other hand, in 2020, Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators (MMOs) processed over 655 million PoS transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion), a 50% increase from 2019.\n\nPoS outlets are not limited to cash deposits and withdrawals. They also offer services like fund transfers, utility bill payments, and airtime recharge.\n\nYou should read the article by one of our senior reporters, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, to know the views of some PoS users and operators in Nigeria.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nAn insight into how early-stage venture firm, Microtraction, invests.

          "text": "Microblogging platform, Twitter, on Wednesday, July 14, 2021, announced that its disappearing posts feature, Fleets, will no longer be available on the platform.\n\nIlya Brown, Twitter Head of Products and Video ads, said in a blog post that the feature will be scrapped on August 3, 2021.\n\nLaunched on August 17, 2020, Fleet was Twitter\u2019s way of getting those who don\u2019t tweet regularly to do so.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter\u2019s Head of Consumer Product, on March 4, 2020, \u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to this feedback and working to create new capabilities that address some of the anxieties that hold people back from talking on Twitter. Today, in Brazil only, we\u2019re starting a test (on Android and iOS) for one of those new capabilities. It\u2019s called Fleets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the number of people joining the conversation with Fleets did not increase. Brown\u2019s blog post revealed that the feature was used mostly as a means of promoting tweets by people who already tweet frequently.\n\nSocial media and disappearing posts\n\nDisappearing posts was first seen on Snapchat with its introduction of Stories in October 2013. It was described as a \u201cnew way to share your day with friends.\u201d The posts last for 24 hours after which they\u2019ll no longer be seen.\n\nThe feature was introduced on Instagram in August 2016. Like Snapchat, Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours of posting. More social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and networking platform, LinkedIn, soon added the feature.\n\nAfter the feature launched on Twitter newly, it suffered stability problems due to heavy usage. Twitter Support tweeted that the rollout of Fleets would be slowed down to \u201cfix some performance and stability problems. If you don\u2019t have the feature yet, you may not get it for a few more days.\u201d\n\nWhile this means the feature was catching on in the beginning, it is not clear why its use reduced.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Twitter declined to give statistics on the usage of Fleets.\n\nHowever, Instagram, claims its Stories see 500 million interactions daily, influencer marketing agency, Mediakix says 150 million \u2014 10% \u2014 of Facebook\u2019s 1.45 billion daily users use Facebook stories. Statista also reveals that daily WhatsApp status users were up to 500 million in Q1 2019.\n\nWith no available data on other platforms\u2019 disappearing posts feature usage, could this mean we\u2019ll see more apps scrap it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter says it has learned from Fleets and will focus on creating other ways to encourage people to join the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Tessi Obasa is a young marine/offshore engineer in Nigeria who does video editing and special effects for fun. His first experience of online learning came in 2016 with a Udemy course on Android programming using Android studio. Since then, he\u2019s taken several other courses to learn new skills.\n\nIt was immediately evident during our chat that he loved learning and picking up new skills.\n\nHe\u2019s had his fair share of challenges in his learning journey, having to battle unreliable Internet connection, power challenges, and inadequate tools to practice with. Once, while taking a course on VFX special effects, the camera he needed for a project cost \u20a6800,000 ($4,000), which he couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nFor context, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage at the time (2016) was \u20a618,000 ($90). But he soldiered on, saying to himself, \u201cMy Tecno phone camera will have to suffice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObasa\u2019s story is not an isolated one, with youth across Africa unable to get the education they need in their country. They turn to edtech platforms to improve their chances of getting a job but are met with waves of problems.\n\nA sore thumb\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret that Africa is facing an unemployment crisis. A large number of Africa\u2019s youth have no jobs or are under-employed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents undergoing training in creative designs at Root Hub, Uyo\n\nWhile the phrase \u201cAfrica rising\u201d may have become hackneyed, one thing is not in doubt, Africa\u2019s young population is growing. According to data from the UN World Population Prospects (PDF), of the 2.4 billion new people that would be added to the current population by 2050, over half (1.3 billion) will come from Africa.\n\nAccording to analysts at the World Bank, this army of youths would join the working population and could potentially drive between 11% and 15% GDP growth on the continent. While these are optimistic outlooks, with a history of not taking advantage of opportunities, even the most optimistic person would have a hard time believing that this population growth is a good development.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the working-age population in Africa grew at 2.6% annually, resulting in 96 million new members of the continent\u2019s workforce. However, only 63 million jobs were created during that period \u2014 a shortfall of 33 million jobs.\n\nAccording to data from the African Development Bank (AfDB) data, between 12 million and 15 million young people enter the job market annually. By 2035, Africa\u2019s working-age population is expected to grow by 450 million people.\n\nHowever, a combination of a private sector incapable of absorbing them and the inability of governments to create suitable environments for them to thrive could mean that most of these youths could either be unemployed or underemployed.\n\nFaced with the prospect of joblessness, young people are taking their destinies into their hands by gaining skills that would enable them to thrive in the workplace. For example, a report (PDF) by Google and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) shows that 31% of software developers in Africa were self-taught. This is a theme that plays out for most digital skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow youths are gaining skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA training class\n\nWith no help forthcoming, African youths are taking their destinies into their hands. There are four major channels through which the skills gap in Africa is being closed:\n\nFormal education\n\nWhether through private schools, public schools, or vocational and technical training schools, formal education remains the best bet for most African youths to gain skills.\n\nHowever, even that comes with its challenges. One-third of youths between the ages of 12 and 14 are out of school, while almost 60% of youths between the ages of 15 and 17 are out of school.\n\nBringing gender into the equation paints a more depressing picture \u2014 9 million girls between the ages of 6 and 11 will never go to school, setting them up for a lifetime of exclusion; those who might be able to afford an education face the challenge of access.\n\nAccording to Quartz Africa, 10 of the most populous countries in Africa have 740 universities serving more than 600 million people. Compare that to Latin America, where 1,834 universities serve a population of 434 million people.\n\nThat means that without the ability to leave their countries for education, many African youths will not get a university education.\n\nEdtech\n\nEdtech platforms have seen increased patronage as smartphone penetration has increased across Africa. The coronavirus pandemic further accelerated its adoption as educational institutions across the continent were shut down. However, there are still two major problems with using edtech platforms: affordability and accessibility.\n\nAccording to Blessing Abeng, Director of Communications at Ingressive for Good, high data costs, unreliable Internet connection, inconsistent or non-existent power supply, and lack of tech tools for practice are some of the challenges African youths face in gaining tech skills.\n\nThis is a view shared by Obasa, who says, \u201cGadgets are expensive due to inflation. If you have the required gadgets, learning online will be much smoother and easier,\u201d he says.\n\nGodwin, another learner, adds, \u201cI once had to take a course on edX but could not afford the certificate even though I finished the course.\u201d A certificate on edX could range from $99 (\u20a640,687) to $149 (\u20a661,237).\n\nPrivate sector\n\nThe private sector is involved in providing African youths with skills, especially those required by the organisation. For example, with African tech talents being poached by companies from the West, some African startups are having to train talents in-house to have any chance of competing.\n\nHotels.ng, a hospitality startup in Nigeria, runs the HNG Internship, a three-month programme that aims to make newbie programmers professionals capable of getting a job. Cowrywise also has a design fund aimed at helping more women get into design.\n\nPeer/self-learning\n\nThis channel has been heavily influenced by technology. With many youths unable to afford to pay for an education, self-learning is often the only route left. Through YouTube videos or edtech platforms that provide some of their content for free, many African youths have acquired the skills that have enabled them to get jobs.\n\nA multi-pronged approach to upskilling Africa\u2019s youth\n\nIf you\u2019ve read up to this point, it is clear that the task of helping African youths gain the right skills is a huge one and cannot be achieved by any one person or group. Instead, it will require collaboration between all relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevamp the education sector\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the education system in Africa needs a massive overhaul. In 2021, only 14 universities from Africa made it into the top 1,000 universities globally, according to a ranking by The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) \u2014 only 4 schools have been added since it released its 2016 rankings. This shows that Africa\u2019s educational sector is inadequate to serve the needs of a rapidly evolving world.\n\nFor significant progress to be made, an overhaul of the entire curriculum at all levels is required. Digital and technical skills that are valuable in the digital economy must be taught, beginning at the primary level if African youths are to compete globally.\n\nAfrican countries can take a cue from Kenya\u2019s DigiSchool Programme and Rwanda\u2019s mission to have more smart classrooms.\n\nExpand digital infrastructure\n\nFor technology to play any role in upskilling Africa\u2019s youths, the necessary infrastructure must be provided. This could be in the form of expanding broadband coverage and providing access to laptops or hubs where young people can access these devices.\n\nData connectivity is also a major requirement. Most African countries have some of the highest data costs globally and are out of reach for most young people.\n\nPublic-private partnerships\n\nWhile governments have a major role to play, the reality is that they cannot solve this problem alone, and so public-private partnerships should be utilised to provide African youths with skills.\n\nCollaboration between governments, multinational development banks, and the private sector will create room for innovative financial models which promote upskilling among Africa\u2019s youths.\n\n\u201cThe government can work with power providers to make sure that we have power for a specific time. That way, we can plan. They can also partner with edtech companies to subsidise the cost of these courses,\u201d Godwin remarks.\n\nPartnerships between the government and the private sector can provide coworking spaces, libraries or give power to people in rural areas often overlooked by traditional energy solutions.\n\nThe Edo State Government of Nigeria recently partnered with Decagon to build a tech park to train 15,000 software engineering talents by 2025. Likewise, the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) has partnered with private organisations to convert recreational parks into makeshift innovation centres.\n\nAnother area for public-private partnerships is job placement. Learning a skill is no guarantee that you will get a job, so governments can partner with private organisations to help them with jobs or internships.\n\n\u201cPlacement helps, not just learning skills but channelling the skills into usefulness,\u201d Collins notes.\n\nUtilising technology to upskill Africa\u2019s youth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA training class\n\n\u201cTech has a multiplier effect, and the lockdown made it very obvious that so much can be done with technology, especially online,\u201d says Ingressive for Good\u2019s Abeng.\n\nThis multiplier effect is why Africa needs to harness technology to provide skills for its youth. Without the need to be physically present, technology can provide technical and vocational skills to African youths.\n\nAbeng reveals that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ingressive for Good partnered with Coursera to give scholarships to 5,000 people and help them learn skills to increase their earning power. The response was massive.\n\n\u201cWe expected only 2,500 to take it seriously, but 20,000+ people applied, over 5,000 were enrolled, and over 4,000 completed courses,\u201d she claims.\n\nThe organisation also has partnerships with DataCamp, Facebook, Jobberman, Geneza, Zuri, and HNG to train almost 100,000 people in digital skills. The same can be applied to virtually any skill.\n\nAfrica\u2019s population boom could become a curse if there are no plans to take advantage of it. However, it could drive progress on the continent if managed well and technology could play a massive role in that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has said that it undertook massive infrastructural facelift in schools across the state to ensure a conducive learning environment for students under the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme.\n\nExecutive Chairperson of the Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (EdoSUBEB), Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe, disclosed this in a chat with journalists.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe shift in classroom culture has been bolstered by improvements in infrastructure.

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",
          "summary": "Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy.\nThe actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it.\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\nRegrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe majority leader in the House of Representatives, Honourable Ado Doguwa, on Friday suggested his colleagues from the Peoples Democratic Party are biased about issues surrounding the electronic transmission of electoral results because they do not understand the provisions of the amendment.\n\nThe House was thrown into disarray on Thursday as members debated section 52(2) of the electoral amendment act bill, which deals with electronic transmission.\n\nOn Friday, PDP lawmakers walked out of a session after presiding officer Deputy Speaker Ahmed Wase insisted that section 52(2) had been carried.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, Hon. Doguwa, a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said the PDP lawmakers were being over-exuberant and desperate.\n\nHe argued that the provisions of the electoral amendment act bill, as passed by the House on Friday, allowed INEC to determine whether it would employ electronic voting or not.\n\nAPC Senators on Thursday had forced through a version of the bill at the Senate that constrained INEC to seek permission from the Nigerian Communications Commission and the National Assembly before employing electronic voting in any part of the country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what version the Senate has, but in the House of Representatives where I serve as the leader, our provisions in respect to section 52(2) is that voting at an election under this act shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Independent National Electoral Commission,\u201d Hon. Doguwa said.\n\n\u201cThis goes to prove to you that the House of Representatives is working in tandem with the constitution. We said voting at an election and transmission of results under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the commission.\n\n\u201cWhether by electronic, manual, or any other technological device, that is left for INEC to determine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe so-called walking out of the PDP members was unfounded and unnecessary because the arguments they came out to protect are already contained in the bill.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hon. Doguwa said it was not a problem if his party, the APC, was against electronic transmission.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with not wanting electronic transmission of results? We have over 49.3 percent of the Nigerian population not covered by network and that would amount to absolute disenfranchisement, so it is a political matter,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s consumer price index (CPI), a measurement of the rate of change in prices of goods and services, has declined to 17.75% in June from 17.93 recorded in May 2021.\n\nThe \u2018Consumer Price Index Report for June\u2019 released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday, means that the prices have continued to increase in June 2021. However, it was at a slower rate than it did in the last month.\n\n\u201cThe CPI measures the average change over time in prices of goods and services consumed by people for day-to-day living,\u201d the NBS noted in its report.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the CPI combines economic theory, sampling and other statistical techniques using data from other surveys to produce a weighted measure of average price changes in the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Headline Index, on a month-on-month basis, moved by 1.06% in June 2021. This figure was 0.05 percentage points higher than what was recorded in May 2021 \u2013 pegged at 1.01%.\n\nThere was also an increase in the urban inflation rate as it jumped by 18.35 %(year-on-year) in June 2021 from May 2021\u2019s 18.51%. On the other hand, the rural inflation rate moved by 17.16% in June 2021 from 17.36% in May 2021.\n\nThe NBS report equally noted that the composite food index increased by 21.83 % in June 2021. This is against the 22.28% reported in May 2021.\n\nThe implication is that prices of food rose in the month under review but at a little slower pace than what was recorded in May 2021.\n\nIncreases in prices of bread, cereals, yam, and others, drove the food price index.\n\nDeepened Woes Of The Poorest\n\nGlobal food prices are rising at their fastest rate in a decade, exacerbating the troubles of the world\u2019s most vulnerable nations as they struggle with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is worried that soaring prices could foment further social unrest in countries already mired in political turmoil.\n\nWhere Are Food Prices Headed?\n\nAccording to the FAO, food prices were nearly 40 percent higher in May than a year ago, the sharpest increase since September 2011.\n\nOn a 12-month basis, the price of corn has skyrocketed by 88 percent, soybean by 73 percent, grain and dairy products by 38 percent, sugar by 34 per cent and meat by 10 percent.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s very concerning,\u201d said Arif Husain, chief economist of the World Food Programme.\n\nIn 2007-2008, brutal increases in the price of basic foodstuffs sparked riots in a number of cities around the world. Peaking in 2010-2011, the price rises acted as a harbinger for the Arab Spring uprisings.",

          "text": "South Africa has begun deploying more than 20,000 troops to assist police in quelling week-long unrest, as the death toll soared to 117 people in the rioting and looting following the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma, authorities said on Thursday.\n\nIn one of the largest deployments of soldiers since the end of white minority rule in 1994, the government said 10,000 soldiers were on the streets by Thursday morning and the South African National Defence Force has also called up all of its reserve force of 12,000 troops.\n\nIn a show of force, a convoy of more than a dozen armoured personnel carriers brought soldiers on Thursday into Gauteng province, South Africa\u2019s most populous, which includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the executive capital, Pretoria.\n\nBuses, trucks, aeroplanes and helicopters were also being used to move the large deployment of troops to trouble spots in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal province that have seen a week of violence in mainly poor areas.\n\nThe unrest, which began last Friday, was triggered by the jailing of former President Zuma but widened into grievances over inequality and poverty.\n\nMore than 2,200 people have been arrested, the acting minister in the presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, told a news conference, adding that Johannesburg was now \u201crelatively calm\u201d.\n\nBut in KwaZulu-Natal province, the epicentre of the violence, the minister said the \u201csituation remains volatile, but much improved and moving towards stability\u201d.\n\nAbout 100 acts of violence had been recorded on Wednesday, but fewer than three dozen on Thursday, she said.\n\nThe violence has so far not spread to South Africa\u2019s seven other provinces, where police are on alert.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Bernard Smith reporting from Johannesburg said it was \u201cmuch calmer\u201d in the country\u2019s economic hub.\n\n\u201cMembers of the [Johannesburg] community are going with the army door-to-door finding people who have been looting from the shops and getting them to give stuff back,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal province, where there has been much more violence, there are fears that the situation could get worse, Smith said.\n\n\u201cThere are already queues outside supermarkets where people are panic buying, and where a refinery was forced to stop operating because \u2026 workers couldn\u2019t get to the refinery. And so that has prompted panic buying a fuel hand in the supermarkets.\u201d\n\nThe unrest has also disrupted hospitals struggling to cope with a third wave of COVID-19. They say they are running out of oxygen and drugs, most of which are imported through Durban.\n\nSome vaccination centres have been forced to shut.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa told leaders of political parties that parts of the country \u201cmay soon be running short of basic provisions\u201d following disruption to supply chains.\n\nMembers of the South Africa Defence Force (SANDF) stand guard outside the Chris Hani Mall in Vosloorus, on the northern outskirts of Johannesburg [Guillem Sartorio/AFP]\n\nSecurity forces increased their presence in the Durban suburb of Phoenix, where the riots caused racial tensions to flare.\n\nThe predominantly Indian residents of Phoenix had been patrolling their area against the unrest and are accused of shooting Black people suspected of being rioters.\n\n\u201cLives have been lost. The communities have a standoff and are in a bad way because it is the Indian community and the neighbouring communities, who are African,\u201d Minister of Police Bheki Cele told a news conference on Thursday in Phoenix, where he said 15 people had been killed.\n\nA woman holds empty beer bottles outside a liquor store as others sort rubble while volunteering to clean the Diepkloof Square following looting and vandalism in Soweto, Johannesburg [Phill Magakoe/AFP]\n\nCele had earlier said that about 12 people were being investigated for inciting and planning the unrest.\n\n\u201cThe Indian nation here in KZN is the second largest outside of India,\u201d the new Zulu king, Misizulu Zulu, said in an appeal to his community on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have lived in peace for many years alongside them. Therefore I ask: Let us be understanding and thoughtful towards each other.\u201d\n\nZuma, 79, was sentenced last month for defying an order to give evidence at a judicial inquiry probing high-level corruption during his time in office from 2009 to 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty in a separate case on charges including corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering.\n\nHe says he is the victim of a witch-hunt by his political foes.\n\nZuma\u2019s fall from grace has opened up a power struggle within the African National Congress (ANC), which has ruled since the end of apartheid in 1994.\n\nThe former president\u2019s loyalists make up the strongest faction opposed to President Ramaphosa.",
