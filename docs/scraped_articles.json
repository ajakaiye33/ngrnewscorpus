Adeyemi Ajayi remanded the ex-AGF, after he was arraigned on a 14-count charge that bordered on conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and money laundering.\n\nThe court held that Idris and other Defendants in the matter should remain in custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service till Wednesday when their bail applications will be heard.\n\nRead Also:\n\n2023: Court okays suit seeking Tinubu\u2019s trial over alleged perjury\n\n2023 Ebonyi Gov\u2019ship: Again, court recognizes Odii as authentic PDP candidate\n\nCourt cleared us to elect new leadership \u2013 TUC\n\nOther Defendants in the matter are: Godfrey Olusegun Akindele, Mohammed Kudu Usman and Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited.\n\nMeanwhile, all the Defendants had after they pleaded not guilty to the charge, separately begged the court to release them on bail, pending the determination of the case against them.\n\nChris Uche, SAN, who appeared for the ex-AGF, assured the court that his client would be available to face the charge against him.\n\nUche, SAN, stressed that the EFCC had earlier granted administrative bail to the Defendant who he said flew into Abuja from Kano state immediately he was notified about the arraignment.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of this nature that the Defendants have been on bail, and since there is no complaint that they violated the administrative bail conditions, I pray that they be allowed to continue to enjoy same\u201d, Uche submitted.\n\nBesides, he drew the attention of the court to the fact that the EFCC earlier seized the international passport of his client.\n\n\u201cThis court has the power to grant bail in a matter of this nature, either by oral application or by a formal application.\n\n\u201cMoreover, we have also filed a formal bail application which we also served same on the Prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe prisons are already saturated and unsafe\u201d, Uche added.\n\nLikewise, counsel to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants urged the court to accede to the request for bail.\n\nHowever, the Prosecution counsel, Mr. Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, told the court that he would need time to respond to the Defendants\u2019 bail applications.\n\nRotimi argued that allowing the Defendants to go home after their arraignment, without hearing and determination of their formal bail applications, would send a wrong signal to the society.\n\n\u201cTo ask them to go home without coming to argue the application for bail will send a wrong signal to the society that if a less important citizen is arraigned, such person would be made to suffer.\n\n\u201cHaving filed the application, we need to react to what they said, especially on the issue that they were granted administrative bail and they complied to it\u201d.\n\nThe Prosecution counsel further argued that the administrative bail that was granted to the Defendants, ended immediately the charge was filed against them.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge my lord not to be persuaded by submissions of the defence lawyers\u201d, Jacobs added.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Ajayi ordered that the Defendants should be remanded at the Kuje Correctional Center.\n\nTwo of the counts in the charge against the Defendants, read: \u201cThat you, Ahmed Idris between February and December, 2021 at Abuja in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, being a public servant by virtue of your position as the Accountant General of the Federation accepted from Olusegun Akindele, a gratification in the aggregate sum of N15.1 billion which sum was converted to the United States Dollars by the said Olusegun Akindele and which sum did not form part of your lawful remuneration but as a motive for accelerating the payment of 13% derivation to the nine oil-producing sates in the Federation, through the office of the Accountant General of the Federation, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 155 of the Penal Code Act Cap 532 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990 and punishable under the same section\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat you, Ahmed Idris while being the Accountant General of the Federation and Godfrey Olusegun Akindele while being the Technical Assistant to the Accountant General of the Federation between February and November, 2021, at Abuja in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, in such capacity, entrusted with certain property, to wit: N84.390 billion committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property, when you dishonestly received the said sum from the Federal Government of Nigeria through Godfrey Olusegun Akindele trading under the name and style of Olusegun Akindele & Co., and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 315 of the Penal Code Act Cap 532 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He was my former boss. Why will I not need his support? Of course I will need his support. I assume I have it.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president of Nigeria noted that he still has the legacy of former President Obasanjo to continue.\n\nRecall that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi had earlier visited the former president to seek his support and blessing ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku has said he is already reaching out to the Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state, saying the party stakeholders will soon reconcile with the aggrieved Rivers state governor.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate said, \u201cWe are reaching out to Governor Wike and we are talking with him and I believe very soon we will find a reconciliation. In fact, very soon, because we are talking to him.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to his governor colleagues.I am very optimistic we are going to resolve our internal crisis and move on,\u201d he added.\n\nAtiku, who described Wike as an influential politician who has a good future in Nigerian politics, noted that he did not reject the governor.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe committee that was set up at my own instance deliberated. There was no vote, and they recommended three names, because they knew it was my prerogative to pick anyone of the three. So, there was actually no vote. It\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cHe Governor Ortom himself chaired that committee. He knew there was no vote taken, and I have the report of that committee. The committee recommended three people and I picked one. I did not go out of that recommendation. So, I think people should be fair to me and should also state the fact,\u201d he added.\n\nRecall that there had been agitation over Atiku\u2019s selection of Governor Ifeanyi Okowo of Delta State as running mate over Wike.\n\nAfter the unveiling of Okowa by Atiku, Wike had been speculated to be considering moving to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nVanguard had reported that the PDP selection committee had recommended the Rivers State governor after 13 of 17 members, who attended a PDP stakeholders meeting voted in favour of Wike.\n\nWike, who participated in the PDP presidential primary scored 237 against the 371 votes secured by Atiku, who won the party ticket.",

The Awomama massacre should not be swept under the carpet. That slaughter, no matter the reasons, is barbaric, offensive, and totally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cThe gruesome murder of some youths at Awomama in Imo State a few days ago has caused public outrage. Since this incident, there have been various narratives about who carried out this dastardly and abominable act, and why.\n\n\u201cWhile some members of the public blame government and her security outfit Ebubeagu for murdering unarmed and defenceless young men coming back from a wedding, the DSS Director, on the other hand, confirmed that his men carried out an operation in a camp, where those he described as \u2018bandits\u2019 were killed, as a means of ensuring public security.\n\n\u201cOur aim is not to delve into this web of contradictory narratives, but to unequivocally condemn this mindless blood-letting, and similar senseless killings, which have bedevilled Igbo society, especially Imo State in recent times.\n\n\u201cOur soil has been defiled by the abominable shedding of innocent blood. We are becoming a society that has no regard for the sanctity of human life and is ready to waste human life at the least provocation. How many of our youths have been cut down in their prime?\n\n\u201cLet us reiterate here that we condemn all killings from all quarters, whether private or public, whether by overzealous, trigger-happy security men or by\n\nparamilitary or cults groups.\u201d\n\nThe cleric said no society can flourish or survive when her future leaders and productive sector of the population are mercilessly mowed down for mere suspicion.\n\nHe further explained that Law and Order are not synonymous with jungle justice. While no one should condone any form of banditry or lawlessness from any quarters, jungle justice and extra-judicial killings cannot be a solution to the challenges of law and order.\n\nLet us reiterate here that we condemn all killings from all quarters, whether private or public, whether by overzealous, trigger-happy security men or by\n\nparamilitary or cults groups, he averred.",

Thereafter, functionaries were deployed to the selected enumeration areas in the nine designated Local Government Areas (LGAs) to commence building numbering and household listing.\n\n\u201cI am happy to announce that building numbering and household listing was completed successfully in Oyo State on July 15 without any hitches or untoward incident.\n\n\u201cI wish to seize this opportunity to acknowledge and to appreciate the support and cooperation of the communities where the exercise took place and to also thank all stakeholders, especially the security outfits that were at hand to ensure the safety and protection of our functionaries.\n\n\u201cValidation of the output of the building numbering and household listing was carried out from July 17 to July 18 2022 and the report again is that the Oyo state team did excellently well to the extent that all the enumeration areas were successfully validated without any reported record of inconsistency,\u201d he said.\n\nOyetunji said that actual enumeration of persons for the trial census is commencing nationwide fully in one LGA in six states.\n\n\u201cOne from each of the geo-political zones and in some selected Enumeration Areas (EAS) in nine LGAs in each of the remaining 31 states of the federation and the FCT.\n\n\u201cThis started July 20 and to end on July 24, to be followed by a mop-up exercise from July 25to July 29 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the in Oyo State, the zero hour for actual enumeration was marked by the enumeration of special transient population in a motor park at Ile-Abu, Ogo-Oluwa LGA at midnight this morning July 20.\n\n\u201cA total of 90 enumerators and nine supervisors are involved in the actual enumeration exercise in Oyo State.

This methodology is to guarantee the accuracy of the census by ensuring that all persons are enumerated only once and in the right place,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, solicited the continued support and cooperation of the community leaders and the general populace where actual enumeration for the trial census will take place.\n\n\u201cI assure that in line with international rules on demographic data collection, all information collected will be accorded utmost confidentiality and will be used only for statistical and developmental planning purposes.\n\n\u201cI enjoin all persons to kindly answer all the questions that enumerators will canvass,\u201d he said\n\nOyetunji also pleaded with the respective security outfits, including the Nigerian Police, the Civil Defence Corps, Vigilante and Amotekun personnel to extend their usual cooperation towards ensuring the safety and protection of functionaries throughout actual enumeration.\n\n\u201cThis will be from July 20 to July 28 when both actual enumeration and the mop exercise will be concluded.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Chukwuma Umeorah\n\nThe National Security Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari has unveiled measures being considered to thwart terrorist activities, including a nationwide ban on motorcycles and mining to cut off their sources of funding.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who briefed State House Correspondents along side his Interior and Police Affairs counterparts, Rauf Aregbesola and Mohammed Dingyadi, respectively, at the end of the meeting, said the decision to focus on the logistics used by the terrorists was deliberate. He said the ban would include motorcycles used for movement and mining, which provides them the money to fund their arms supply.\n\nMalami added that Federal Government is now looking into ways to stymie their actions by blocking the already identified sources.He noted that terrorists have shifted from traditional methods of funding to mining and ransom taking, necessitating government action.\n\nMinister of Interior confirmed that significant efforts were made to gather intelligence prior to the recent attack on the Kuje Correctional Centre, but expressed regret that there was a lack of will to act on it.\n\nAregbesola, who said the preliminary investigation on the attack had been submitted to the president, assured that all those found to have shirked their responsibilities at the end of the ongoing investigation would be punished.\n\n\u201cPlacing a ban on the use of motorcycles and mining activities will cut the supply of logistics to the terrorists. This will be done in the national interest. We are Nigerians because Nigeria as a country exists and any issue that will translate into a threat to national security or the corporate existence of the country requires certain sacrifices.\n\n\u201cSo, regardless of the means that is being considered for the possible banning, this is a sacrifice that we see as what will help address the security challenges and I think no sacrifice is too big as far as that issue is concerned.\n\n\u201cAbove all, if you are talking of banning motorcycles for example, I think the number of people using these motorcycles is not up to 20 percent of the Nigerian population. So, if that percentage is called to make a sacrifice that is all pervading or affecting over 200 million Nigerians, I think that sacrifice is not too much and is worthy of being considered.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Minister, the responsibility of government is to protect the public interest over individual interests, so the bans being considered by the government are in the national interest.\n\nMalami stated that since government\u2019s blockage of terrorist funding sources, the enemies of the state have resorted to using unconventional sources of funding, such as mining and ransom collection, to fund their nefarious activities.\n\nIt\u2019ll worsen insecurity -Ejiofor, ex-DSS boss\n\nSecurity expert and former director of Department of State Services (DSS), Mike Ejiofor, has warned that banning of commercial motorcycles would increase security challenges in the country.\n\nEjiofor who spoke on a television interview monitored in Lagos, said if government go ahead with its decision, it would have great socio-economic implications and also worsen insecurity rather than solve the problem\n\nHe advised that if a nationwide ban must be implemented, government needs to provide a viable alternative for the high number of Nigerians who will be left without a daily source of income, pointing out that they could easily see crime as a way out and a means of survival.\n\nHe, however, said government should map out those areas where okada is generally used to commit crime and implement a ban in those areas.\n\n\u201cI think what government should do is to identify established areas, especially in the North West where you have these bandits using bikes and ban the motorcycles in those areas.\u201d\n\nHe also said ease of movement in rural areas should be considered before implementation of a nationwide okada ban. He said motor vehicles cannot easily access most rural areas and a ban would only increase the untold hardship of Nigerians in those areas.\n\n\u201cIf we say there is a ban on motorcycles, how would people be travelling ,especially in rural areas and remote communities?\u201d he queried.\n\nHe advised that government needed to restrategise with regards to security challenges in the country and how to tackle them.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim and Isaac Anumihe, Abuja\n\nNigeria recorded a N3.09 trillion deficit in its 2022 budget operations between January and April.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, made the startling revelation on Thursday at the Public Consultative Forum on the draft Federal Government 2023-2025 Medium Term Fiscal Framework & Fiscal Strategy, in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the deficit brought to the fore the lingering fiscal challenges facing the government.\n\nAside the staggering deficit, Ahmed pushed for complete elimination of petrol subsidy, stressing that projections show that fuel subsidy may gulp about N6.72 trillion in 2023, a development that could wipe off the nation\u2019s entire revenue for the year.\n\n\u201cWe have two scenarios here. Business-as-Usual scenario: This assumes that the subsidy on PMS, estimated at N6.72 trillion for full year 2023, will remain and be fully provided for.\n\n\u201cScenario 2 \u2013Reform scenario: This assumes that petrol subsidy will remain up to mid-2023 based on the 18-month extension announced early 2021, in which case only N3.36 trillion will be provided for.\n\n\u201cAs of April 2022, FGN\u2019s retained revenue was only N1.63 trillion, 49 per cent of the prorata target of N3.32 trillion.\n\n\u201cThe actual spending as of April 31st was N4.72 trillion. Of the N4. 72 trillion, N1.94 trillion was spent on debt service; N1.26 trillion on personnel cost, including pensions; and N773.63 billion on capital expenditure\u201d.\n\nThe Minister further disclosed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) which hitherto funded the fuel subsidy until last month would offload that responsibility to the federation.\n\nThis, she noted would further exert a huge strain on the fiscal position of the Federal Government, while describing fuel subsidy as a monster that must be decimated. The Minister frowned at the low oil revenue amid hefty subsidy payouts, that has resulted in zero remittance to the Federation Account by the NNPC.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe gross oil and gas federation revenue for full year 2022 was projected at N9.37 trillion. As at April 30, 2022, N1.23 trillion was realised out of the prorata projection of N3.12 trillion, representing a mere 39 per cent performance.\n\n\u201cDespite higher oil prices, oil revenue underperformed due to significant oil production shortfalls for two main reasons: oil production shut-ins resulting from pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft; and high petrol subsidy cost due to higher landing costs of imported products.\n\nShe added, \u201cActual average crude oil price is higher than the budget benchmark price of $73 per barrel. However, higher oil price is offset by lower oil output, which as of April 2022 stood at an average of 1.32 mbpd.\u201d",

So we saw that the vast majority of people and professionals like professors, doctors, lawyers etc. don\u2019t vote on election\u2019s day. They stay in the comfort of their homes and begin to analyse.\n\n\u201cI was commissioned as a consultant medical doctor to talk to professionals and our plan is to get five million votes for Atiku come 2023 election. We are presently in 31 states of Nigeria; present in over 600 wards in Nigeria and in 20 countries in Europe, America and Canada and we are increasing in number by the day.\u201d\n\nEkele added: \u201cWe discovered that it is better to vote for 12 than to vote for six. Look at the classification of all the major contenders, Atiku, Obi and Tinubu. Obi was brought to the limelight by Atiku. Obi till tomorrow believes in Atiku so I will rather be obediently Atikulated. Obi still calls Atiku his boss. So, if I have the opportunity to go for the best why should I go for the better?\n\n\u201cAtiku is a proven man with successful business. A man that is healthy. History has proven that age too has nothing to do with performance because the youth are even more corrupt. Some of the youth are ritual killers.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, all the youths given opportunity have failed. Some of these youth have been fantastically corrupt. So the issue is not about age but about personality and character and integrity and that is what we see in Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about Atiku being corrupt but people forget that Atiku doesn\u2019t have any single corruption case in court today. As the Vice President he was taken to court eleven times up to the Supreme Court and he won all.\n\n\u201cAtiku should be praised because he used his money to stop the third term agenda of Obasanjo and that\u2019s why Obasanjo is against him. Atiku is presidential in character and approach and can manage this country.\u201d",

It is equally important we make it abundantly clear that Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii remains the authentic gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in Ebonyi State. This is contrary to the fake news being spread by mischief makers and hired foot-soldiers of falsehood and deceit.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, let me draw your attention to the summary of the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Abuja delivered on July 19, 2022. The Appeal Court remitted the appeal filed by Sen. Obinna Ogba to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court to re-assign the matter to another Judge of the Federal High Court for re-trial.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOn the other hand, the Federal High Court in Abakaliki passed another judgement on a related issue. The court nullified the governorship, Senate, House of Representatives and House of Assembly primaries held on June 4 and 5, 2022, which purportedly produced Ogba and others as PDP candidates for the 2023 general election in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cThe court declared the exercise as unconstitutional, illegal, null and void. The court held that Ogba and other PDP aspirants in his line up made use of fake delegates during the primaries, as 90 percent of the authentic delegates had boycotted the primaries held on June 4 and 5, 2022.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it was equally held that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not monitor the primaries as required by the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cThe court upheld the authentic PDP primaries conducted on May 28 and 29, 2022, which produced Dr. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odi and other candidates elected during the primaries.\n\n\u201cWith this development, it means that Ogba and his fellow travelers have no genuine reason to jubilate as they reportedly did on July 19, 2022. We have gone beyond the stage of mundane/empty propaganda and orchestrated falsehood tailored to deceive the people in the streets.\u201d\n\nOnyike added that Ogba has no locus to parade himself as the candidate of PDP in the state, stressing that: \u201cAnybody who parades himself as the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Ebonyi State or any other candidate for that matter would be seen and perceived as an impostor, meddlesome interloper and a political miscreant and may be liable for criminal contempt of court.\u201d",

          "text": "It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Gaa-Lamba, a community in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State.\n\nSalamatu Ayinde, a 26-year-old nursing mother, stood in front of her house with a worried look on her face.\n\nBorehole at Gaa-Lamba Village\n\nClad in a brown-striped wrapper that barely covered her chest, the nursing mother had her gaze fixed on the ground and one hand on her collarbone.\n\nMs Ayinde was lost in thought when SaharaReporters approached her to inquire about the Zonal Intervention Project (ZIP)-facilitated borehole in her community.\n\nShe looked up with a jolt, sighed and began to complain bitterly.\n\n\u201cThat borehole has never been useful to us. It stopped working a few moments after its inauguration in January 2021,\u201d she said, leading SaharaReporters to the borehole at the back of her house. \u201cSince then, water has been a big challenge.\u201d\n\nMs Ayinde's major concern that afternoon was where to get water to perform her house chores as a housewife.\n\nFor her water needs, the nursing mother had relied on a neighbour who had a borehole in her community.\n\n\u201cEvery morning we usually take our bucket to a neighbour's compound to fetch,\u201d Ms Ayinde said, gloomily. \u201cBut for the last few days, they have refused to pump water because they said people always disturb their sleep while fetching in the morning.\"\n\nMs Ayinde is not the only one disturbed about the water situation in the community. A woman in the community who identified herself as Iya-Ibeji is also troubled.\n\n\u201cIn Gaa-Lamba, to get common water is a big problem for us,\" said the short fair woman. \u201cWe have complained to our community leader so many times, but they have done nothing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"When this borehole was brought, we thought we had finally won the battle of trekking long distances to get a bucket of water. But our joy was short-lived when the borehole could not serve us beyond a few days.\n\nGaa-Lamba is one of the communities that benefited from the Zonal Intervention Borehole Water Project facilitated by an honourable member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi. But, the finding shows that even though the new borehole was installed, it could not serve the people beyond a few after it was opened.\n\nThe Water Situation In Kwara\n\nPoor access to clean and potable water for use in many households across Nigeria has contributed majorly to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and several others.\n\nAccording to data from Water and Sanitary Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping (WASH NORM) in 2019, only 14 per cent of the country\u2019s population have access to safely managed drinking water supply facilities.\n\nThe survey also shows that access for people in rural communities is four times less than the population of urban areas. This is due to such supply points being more than 30 minutes away from their homes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent report by UNICEF and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the north-central region ranks lowest of all geopolitical zones in the number of people using basic water supply, sanitation services.\n\nOut of the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT), Kwara ranks 36th, just a step above Ebonyi which sits at the bottom of the table.\n\nUNICEF reports that when sources of water are not within immediate premises, women and children pay the price of water collection.\n\nThe N100M Water Projects\n\nTo bring potable water closer to the people of his constituency, In 2020, a member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi, nominated projects for the provision of motorized boreholes at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward and at Afon, in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State at the sum of N25 million each (N50 Million in total).\n\nThe projects, which were part of the 2020 Appropriation Act, were aimed at resolving water scarcity across six villages. These villages are Gaa-Lamba, Labintan Alakuko, Giwa-Olowo, Ile Baale Afon, Sakama, and Gaa-Igboroko. It was placed under the supervision of the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA).\n\nA document released by the supervising agency which was obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that the budgeted sum (N100,000,000.00) was totally cash-backed on the projects.\n\nOn-site fact-finding\n\nTo monitor the projects, SaharaReporters embarked on site verification of these borehole projects supervised by the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA) at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward.\n\nVisits to the locations of these projects revealed that although new boreholes were installed at these villages, except for the one built at Giwa Olowo village that was found still serving the community, the other two installed at Labintan Alakuko and 0Gaa-Lamba could not solve the problem of water scarcity in these communities.\n\nThe borehole built at Gaa-Lamba was not functioning during SaharaReporters\u2019 investigation, while that of Labitan Alakuko was functioning but could not serve the population that depended on it.\n\n\"The borehole is working but the problem is that it is not pumping water well,\" said Ismaila Alao, a resident of Labitan Alakuko Village.\n\n\"To fetch a 25-litre jerry-can, you would need to wait for at least an hour and this is why many residents do not even bother about the borehole.\n\n\"As you can see, it has been a while since we went there because no one is ready to contribute money to buy petrol and at the end, the borehole will not pump well,\" he added.\n\nLike many disadvantaged communities in Kwara, where the presence of government was not felt in any way, people of Labitan Alakuko village have many years relied on wells and a stream for their survival and the women in the communities have to struggle daily with walking long distances to the stream to fetch water for drinking, cooking and doing chores.\n\nWhen the borehole had just been drilled, it was a dream come true as women, children and men joyfully thought going to streams to get water would be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cBut we are still going to the streams to fetch water because the borehole is not enough for us,\" said a woman who was too angered to give her name.\n\nAFON\n\nWhen SaharaReporters visited the locations for the second phase of the projects in Afon, it was discovered that boreholes were installed at Ile Baale Afon, Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko villages.\n\nWhile the people of Ile-Baale Afon were still benefiting from the water project installed in front of their community, residents of Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko complained of lack of water as the boreholes installed were not functioning. They were still forced to trek long distances to neighbouring villages in search of potable water.\n\nBalikisu, a mother of five who is a resident of Sakama village said, \"We fetch water from wells or streams. And Sometimes, we pay pushcart users money to get water for us to drink and do our house chores.\n\n\"All this would have stopped if the borehole installed for us was working well,\" Balikisu added.\n\n\n\nLNRBDA Spends 50 Million Naira On Ote-Ballah Dam But No Value Derives\n\nAnother water project nominated in 2020 by Abdulyekeen Alajagusi for the people of his constituency was the rehabilitation of the Ote-Ballah Dam. N50 million was allocated in the 2020 Federal Government budget for the rehabilitation of this dam in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara.\n\nAccording to the information received from Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA), the total sum of N50M was released to rehabilitate the dam which has been abandoned since 2003 and awarded to Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited.\n\nA visit to the dam by SaharaReporters showed that despite the public funds committed to the project, residents of the communities are yet to derive value for the money as they still scramble for water to meet their daily needs.\n\n\"It has been over ten years we fetched tap water here,\" said Kamaru Yusuf, a resident of Alalubosa Area, Ote, in the Asa local government area.\n\nAnother resident of Ote who identified herself as Amope said for the past seven years since she was married into the community, she had never fetched water from the tap.\n\n\"We only get water from hand-pupping boreholes and wells,\" Amope said.\n\nContractor Speaks\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Fatai Aberi, the Managing Director of Fab Confidential Limited told SaharaReporters\u2019 correspondent that they had completed the project and got a 'satisfied' acknowledgement after the needed assessment from LNRBDA, the supervisory agency.\n\nHe said despite the N25 million contract sum released for the project, he also used part of his personal funds to see that the project was complete\n\nBut when told about the situation of some of the boreholes that stopped supplying water shortly after inauguration, he said, \"For now, I can't promise anything but we will try and see what we can do.\"\n\nNo Comment on Ote-Ballah Dam\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, all efforts to get the reaction of the lawmaker regarding his failure to rehabilitate dam projects he had facilitated for members of his constituency were not successful. He did not answer several calls from SaharaReporters and did not reply to text and Whatsapp messages sent to his mobile line.\n\nAlso, Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited, the company that handled the project, did not return several calls, text messages, and Whatsapp messages sent to them, asking for their comment on the dam project.",

          "text": "Atiku Abubakar says a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket is the bane of his \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d with Bola Tinubu, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), since 2007.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate spoke in a chat with Arise TV on Friday.\n\nTinubu had picked Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, as his running mate for the APC presidential ticket. The development elicited outrage from key stakeholders due to the fact that both of them are Muslims.\n\nAtiku and Tinubu were allies during the lead-up to the 2007 general election. The former vice-president had left the PDP to become the presidential candidate of the Action Congress (AC), with Tinubu as the leading chieftain of the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe party however lost the presidential election to PDP\u2019s Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, with Atiku later returning to PDP.\n\nAlthough they reunited when APC was formed in 2014, they have since been on the opposite sides of the political spectrum.\n\nReacting to Tinubu\u2019s choice of a Muslim running mate, Atiku said it was why he \u201cdeparted politically\u201d from the former Lagos governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe claimed that Tinubu had wanted to be his running mate for the AC presidential ticket, and he refused.\n\nAtiku added that he and Tinubu are \u201cstill friends\u201d but they \u201chave political differences\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy fundamental disagreement and political departure with Asiwaju [Tinubu] since 2007 was due to the Muslim-Muslim ticket. Remember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed ACN,\u201d the PDP candidate said.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yaradua. That was the parting point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, and there should be a religious balance in our leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are still friends, of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have political differences. We have been having political differences ever since we became friends. Nothing unusual about that.\u201d",

The development elicited outrage from key stakeholders due to the fact that both of them are Muslims.\n\nAtiku and Tinubu were allies during the lead-up to the 2007 general election. The former vice-president had left the PDP to become the presidential candidate of the Action Congress (AC), with Tinubu as the leading chieftain of the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe party however lost the presidential election to PDP\u2019s Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, with Atiku later returning to PDP.\n\nAlthough they reunited when APC was formed in 2014, they have since been on the opposite sides of the political spectrum.\n\nReacting to Tinubu\u2019s choice of a Muslim running mate, Atiku said it was why he \u201cdeparted politically\u201d from the former Lagos governor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe claimed that Tinubu had wanted to be his running mate for the AC presidential ticket, and he refused.\n\nAtiku added that he and Tinubu are \u201cstill friends\u201d but they \u201chave political differences\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy fundamental disagreement and political departure with Asiwaju [Tinubu] since 2007 was due to the Muslim-Muslim ticket. Remember, I opted out of PDP because of zoning, and together with Asiwaju we formed ACN,\u201d the PDP candidate said.\n\n\u201cTinubu wanted to be my running mate when I was given the ACN presidential ticket in 2007, but I disagreed. And because of that, he switched his support to the late Umar Yaradua. That was the parting point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, and there should be a religious balance in our leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are still friends, of course. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have political differences. We have been having political differences ever since we became friends. Nothing unusual about that.\u201d",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Yesterday, global streaming service Netflix announced via its Q2 2022 financial results that it lost 970,000 subscribers in the second quarter of the year.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that the streaming service is suffering a massive blow to its subscriber base. In the first quarter of this year, the service reported its first subscriber loss in 10 years with a 200,000 subscriber decline.\n\nAt the time, Netflix outlined 4 reasons for its subscriber decline: an increase in streaming services; geopolitical events like Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; a decline in addressable market; and more notably, an increase in household password sharing. According to Netflix, over 100 million of its 222 million paying subscribers are sharing their passwords with people outside of their households.\n\nNetflix experiencing another dip in its subscriber count doesn\u2019t come as a shock to the service because it predicted, in April, that it would lose up to 2 million subscribers in Q2. Its subscriber growth decline, however, was less than half of that. Netflix\u2019s biggest subscriber loss came from its largest markets, the US and Canada, where Netflix said it lost 1.3 million users. This number was offset by an increase in subscribers from other regions.\n\nWhile the streaming service has not commented on reasons for its recent decline, experts project that it\u2019s due to the proliferation of streaming services. With the launch of HBO Max, Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix\u2019s library of movies, series and even games will be limited as more studios launch their own streaming platforms.\n\nNetflix, however, still has the biggest share of the streaming service market with 220 million subscribers while Amazon\u2019s Prime Video holds 200 million, while Disney+ and HBO Max hold 87.6 million and 74 million subscribers respectively.\n\n1 million subscribers in Q3\n\nThe service also plans to keep its top spot and add 1 million subscribers to its tally by Q3.\n\nTo do this, the service will implement a few long-term solutions, including increased movie and game development budgets. It\u2019s introducing ads to its platform in a partnership with Microsoft.

          "title": "Hannah Subayi believes the gap between Anglophone and Francophone African startups is reducing",
          "text": "Hannah Subayi Kamuanga\u2019s passion for investing is evident in the many hats she wears as a foremost investor in the African tech ecosystem.\n\nShe\u2019s currently the country manager for development finance institution Propaco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a board member of the African Business Angel Network, and a partner at Dazzle Angels, a female-focused angel fund. She\u2019s also an investment committee member in 2 pan-African investment funds: Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures.\n\nPrior to her taking up these roles, she spent 7 years at South Suez Capital, an African private equity fund, and 2 years at the Switzerland-headquartered financial services company, Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cI love to find, identify talent, provide capital, and see talent grow to create something out of the business, see it grow over time,\u201d Subayi shared with TechCabal over a call. \u201cInvesting in companies allows me to combine my data crunching technical skills and legal skills, such as poring over legal briefs or policy documents, while redefining the future of Africa one investment at a time.\u201d\n\nTechCabal sat down with Subayi to learn more about her experience and life as an African investor.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What does investing mean to you?\n\nHannah Subayi: Investing is really about identifying talent, whether it\u2019s a startup, a large business, or a team of promoters trying to set up infrastructure projects. You assess funding needs, structure a deal, invest and monitor the investments. This turns out to have a massive impact in Africa, which I\u2019m very passionate about, and then obviously, you make money while at it.\n\nCurrently, as Propaco\u2019s country officer in DRC, which is a frontier market, I have the opportunity to invest through the entire spectrum of different projects from infrastructure financing, down to early-stage startups. Without any conflict, I also advise Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures, which is the most active fund on the continent with 90% of our founders being local African founders and 25% of them being female.\n\nAs an investor, I\u2019d like to ensure that founders in markets like DRC and Madagascar are also getting the funding that they need from institutional investors.\n\nPersonally, I have set up a new investment club here in the DRC. In March, we did our first seed investment in a local Congolese company manufacturing and distributing industrial cleaning products such as soaps and toothpaste, which are made from local African products like palm oil.\n\nThis investment is a big deal for us because DRC is a typical African country where about 80\u201390% of our products are actually imported. We don\u2019t have any active industries outside of the mining industry. One of our mission statements as an investment club is that we\u2019re going to support local companies that\u2019ll turn out to become as big as Africa\u2019s leading industrial conglomerate, Dangote, and help industrialise the economy in DRC.\n\nDA: What has the transition from private equity to angel investing and venture capital been like?\n\nHS: As an investor, I\u2019m quite passionate about reinventing myself. Every 3\u20134 years I discover new industries, new financial instruments, and products. I started out investing through private equity in Africa for a few years; this prepared me as I built my own personal wealth to become an angel investor to back the next wave of entrepreneurs.\n\nI started Dazzle Angels angels back in 2019, right after investing for many years through private equity. I think my experience as an angel investor led me to become more passionate about startups and early-stage investments. And with many investment clubs behaving more like VC firms, despite not having the same technical skills, network and funds, it\u2019s natural that many angel investors move over to become VC investors.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in startups you want to invest in?\n\nHS: For me, I really like to focus on the team, focusing on their consistency and ability to deliver, as well as their resilience, because I think it\u2019s really important in Africa to be resilient.\n\nI ask questions such as do I like the business? Do I understand what they do? Do I feel like there is a prospect for growth and profitability? How disruptive are businesses or what type of impact do they have on the ground?\n\nWhat is the execution risk? Personally, when I look at an investment opportunity I think of how I can mitigate all of those risks. Obviously, you have to consider the competitive dynamics of the sector and the regulatory environment. But again, with the right team and the right business model, you can navigate those things pretty easily.\n\nIn addition, the deal structure is important because you need to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right amount of funding.\n\nDA: What red flags do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nHS: Personally, it\u2019s always down to the people. For me, a red flag is when the entrepreneur is not completely committed or convinced by his business, his venture\u2014if he\u2019s running 4 or 5 other projects.\n\nThe next has to do with the deal terms, which is also a reflection of the team. I think as an investor if you\u2019re not comfortable with the deal terms, and you feel that the entrepreneur is asking for a valuation that\u2019s too high or asking for terms that are too negative for you, then it\u2019s something you might want to walk away from.\n\nFor example, there have been instances when entrepreneurs that don\u2019t have a turnover or make less than $5,000\u201310,000 per month state that their valuation is $5 or $10 million. I often reply by telling them that\u2019s not how it works. These unreasonable expectations are reflected in the terms of the percentage founders offer investors. This also comes up when founders expect investors to make too many business introductions for them. Obviously, as an investor, you\u2019re to make a few introductions but not to become the commercial director.\n\nSo already during the due diligence phase, if you hear that the entrepreneurs are asking for many things like commercial introductions that you can\u2019t deliver, then I think you should walk away, and vice versa.\n\nDA: Can you share an overview of what investing in the different regions of Africa look like?\n\nHS: The difference between regions in Africa is a reflection of the economic and social development history. As you know anglophone Africa tends to be a bit more advanced than Arab-speaking and francophone Africa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak too much about lusophone Africa\u2014Portuguese-speaking countries\u2014even though I\u2019ve made an investment in a startup in Mozambique because I think these are frontier markets with a different language, which are not that connected to the rest of the continent.\n\nNevertheless, we noticed that in all the 3 main regions\u2014anglophone, Arab-speaking, and francophone\u2014we see more and more local institutional funders being active with the right technical skills and willingness to back local champions, which is very optimistic.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an improvement in the regulatory environment. More startup investment clubs are being supported by local governments. We see universities putting in place structures to assist students who want to create their own startups. We see VC firms being more active at the seed level, series A, and other levels. Generally speaking on the continent, there is still a lack of sufficient pre-seed funding, which typically is taken care of by the government.\n\nThe quality of companies is increasing everywhere. I\u2019m always happy to demonstrate that even in francophone Africa, you\u2019ll find 5 founders and startups who have better metrics in terms of turnover, number of users, and profitability than in Anglophone Africa.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny that the operational environment remains a bit tougher to some extent in francophone Africa. So, obviously, if you\u2019re a founder in one of these francophone markets, compared to someone who might be in South Africa, or Egypt, you\u2019ll struggle a bit more and the pace at which your business grows is not the same.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an increase in intra-Africa transactions. So, we see more North African investors who are trying to get into anglophone Africa. We see more anglophone African investors trying to invest in francophone Africa. So it\u2019s very exciting to be alive at this time when investors and startups are operating across different regions.\n\nPart of the reason why this is happening is that there are more investors just like me who have worked and studied across different regions, enabling them to understand the different contexts and navigate them better. We have more African investors who are well-rounded in terms of understanding the different ecosystems and we see an increase in investment into the 3 regions, and hopefully, francophone Africa will continue to catch up.\n\nDA: Anything more, especially about the francophone Africa space?\n\nHS: Historically, francophone Africa, just by virtue of the language, mainly only looked to France for funding and expansion. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case anymore.\n\nIf you look at startups, like Wave, you can see that most of the funding came from the US and other international investors. If you look at francophone African startups, they are incorporated in Paris but that\u2019s not any different from other startups that are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nIrrespective of where startups are incorporated, I think that there\u2019s some uniformity around standard practices and strategies of startups in the continent, which also explains why we see an uptick in investments for Africa. There\u2019s a similarity in the way entrepreneurs think about their growth and expansion and how they talk to investors, which is literally what you want because you want to make sure that everybody\u2019s playing on an equal field and to make sure that startups are receiving the right level of funding.\n\nDA: What\u2019s it like being a female investor?\n\nHS: I think there are many features in my profile that some people might interpret in a good or negative way, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about positioning. It\u2019s all about being consistent in terms of who you are as an investor, what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and connecting with the right type of opportunities.\n\nAs a female investor in francophone Africa, I haven\u2019t really felt potentially discriminated against because I\u2019ve worked with entrepreneurs who respect me. Typically, if you demonstrate that you have the right technical skills, the right network, and are a nice person, people will work with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to managing our careers or raising funds, it might be more challenging for female investors. But it\u2019s a representation of the issues that female professionals face in all industries. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the worst in the investment space.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding what you can bring to the table and adapting your strategy to suit the person you\u2019re dealing with. Also, at the end of the day, as an investor, you also have to walk away from situations and opportunities that are clearly not capable or willing to work with you.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nHS: When I look at all the great African investors like Mariame Diop, Zachariah George, or Tomi Davies who are doing much more than I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s always humbling.\n\nManaging Propaco in DRC takes most of my time, attending investor committees, talking to CEOs of large companies and startups to talk about due diligence processes monitoring, investment, doing site visits, as well as here in DRC. I also occasionally deal with lawyers to be sure the legal documentation is correct or dealing with litigation.\n\nI do all of this and attend social events like seminars and conferences. We don\u2019t talk enough about that because as an investor, it\u2019s quite important to be well connected to your business community, whether it\u2019s other investors or entrepreneurs.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nHS: When we started Launch Venture Africa last year, we were investing in startups with no revenue but now it\u2019s difficult for us to look at a startup that\u2019s not generating at least $20,000. That\u2019s how competitive the market has become.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more investments between various financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing more synergies between investment clubs, and there are new structures that are put in place that are a mix of investment clubs and VC funds, like Future Africa and Dakar Network Angels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "How to navigate delivery apps and traditional logistics companies in Lagos and Kaduna",
          "text": "This week\u2019s Everyday People comes with a little twist. In the last two months, we\u2019ve talked to a DJ who teaches kids coding, a lawyer who\u2019s also a content creator, a gadget seller at Computer Village, Ikeja, an Uber driver, a dentist turned YouTuber, and Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer.\n\nThis time, we\u2019ll be talking to three business owners about their experiences with delivery and logistics in the bustling city of Lagos and the ancient Kaduna town.\n\nFirst up, Egemba Michael Kachi, chef, photographer, and perfume merchant.\n\nKachi, Perfume Merchant\n\nDo you use delivery apps?\n\nI don\u2019t really use delivery apps. Someone introduced me to one, but I can\u2019t remember the platform. I booked the ride and was asked to pay, which I did. I was told the delivery person would be with me in about two hours. Throughout the day, I did not see anybody, didn\u2019t do the delivery, and had already paid.\n\nSo, I spoke to them, and they said, \u201cOkay, it won\u2019t happen next time,\u201d and I believed them. The next day, the same thing happened.\n\nKachi\n\nThey eventually did the delivery, but that was it for me; I just went back to my individual rider companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your experience with traditional delivery companies?\n\nWith delivery companies, just mentally prepare yourself because you can\u2019t control anything. They could pick up from you and tell you they are going there immediately, and only for you to realise five or six hours later, late in the evening, that they\u2019ve still not delivered.\n\nThey\u2019ll tell you, \u201cOh, the bike spoilt.\u201d\n\nOr, they were held up by local government boys, or they had an accident, blah blah blah. So whenever I\u2019m doing deliveries, I basically tell my customers, \u201cYou could get it today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nNot that I\u2019m giving an excuse, but just in case something happens. And the annoying thing is when they know they\u2019re running late, they won\u2019t call. If you call, they might not pick up or be very rude when they do.\n\nOne time I gave a package to the wrong rider; I was so confused that day, like, \u201cWho did I give my perfume to?\u201d It didn\u2019t end there, though. The rider dropped it off at their office, and my perfume went missing. The manager had to threaten not to pay his people their salaries before it was found.\n\nAnother time, the rider delivered the perfume at 11 p.m. At night! To give him credit, the manager had told me it would be same-day delivery; I just didn\u2019t know his today meant from the start of the day to the end of the day.\n\nSo how do you handle customers then?\n\nI steadily update them. So that gives them a bit of confidence. It would be very odd if I told them a rider had picked up and they didn\u2019t hear anything from the rider or me all day, and they didn\u2019t see their deliveries all; it\u2019d look like I\u2019m a fraud. So I\u2019m constantly communicating with the riders and giving the customers feedback.\n\nNext, we have Feranmi Ajetomobi, a growth marketer at Flutterwave and the Founder of Nigerian food startup, NiFries.\n\nFeranmi, Founder of NiFries\n\nFeranmi\n\nHow do you run your deliveries?\n\nWe do a mix, actually. So we have apps, and our delivery guys, like people we built relationships with to help handle the deliveries. That is very important because when you start running a delivery service for food in Lagos if you depend solely on apps, you\u2019d most likely be disappointed unless the orders come from the apps.\n\nMost times, you have to actually get traditional riders who are available at any time. It\u2019s a supply-demand issue because, say, I finished cooking by 11:00 a.m. and somebody orders at that point, I would have to go into the app, order for a rider, and then wait for the rider to come.\n\nSometimes some riders don\u2019t come early, and at other times, you wouldn\u2019t even get the rider. So there\u2019s a big supply issue when it comes to the delivery apps.\n\nFor areas around us, we\u2019ve actually resorted to bicycles that handle deliveries on our behalf.\n\nThere\u2019s also pricing. If somebody orders food by 11:00 a.m. and you tell them they\u2019ll get it in 45 minutes, but another order comes before you finish packaging it by 11:45 a.m., one rider can take everything.\n\nBut when it comes to the apps, I need to wait for orders to compile before I can make a request.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nI think logistics companies that focus on other forms of logistics have no business with the food business because, first off, the margins are very low. Nobody wants to pay \u20a61,000 ($2) for food that costs \u20a6800 ($1.8). But say I\u2019m buying shoes, I will pay \u20a61,500 ($3) because the shoes probably cost \u20a610,000 ($23) or even \u20a630,000 ($70).\n\nBecause of that margin cost, you either give that delivery company a bulk of those orders, or they charge you high because you\u2019ve made just one order.\n\nThe alternative I\u2019ve seen work is with companies like Chowdeck, a logistics company for food businesses. And their approach is to run a marketplace where food operators like me can list our business and get orders through them. It is the same thing with Bolt Food.\n\nThat way, I don\u2019t bother with logistics; I don\u2019t bother about the price. The good thing is that aside from running that marketplace, you can have an agreement with Chowdeck that allows you to have some bikes and bicycles at your store.\n\nIt is possible to get orders or process orders outside their marketplace. The hybrid structure is the best, honestly, because it allows you to mix the marketplace structure with your bike.\n\nYou have more professionalism, and you can easily track your goods. There\u2019s accountability and protection for your product. And some of them even insure your products, so if they get damaged, you are covered to an extent.\n\nWould you ever enter the logistics part of the business?\n\nThere\u2019s no economic sense in owning a bike. In the future, I can come together with other food business owners and build a consortium of bikes; we\u2019d put money together and own our delivery network.\n\nThen I can be confident to own bikes. But for me, to own banks on my own, it\u2019s not a wise business decision at all. It\u2019s too expensive. Maintainance capital costs and even operational costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you wish delivery apps could do better?\n\nTracking. Most of them are bad at it so you can\u2019t accurately track where the rider is with your food.\n\nLast but not least is Yetunde Aisha, the Founder of Shop Yetu, who sells thrift items and essential oils.\n\nYetunde, Entrepreneur\n\nYetunde\n\nSo how do you do your deliveries?\n\nI deliver within and outside Kaduna. At first, I was using all these normal bike logistics companies for deliveries within Kaduna.\n\nBut late last year, there was a ban on all motorcycles, so those logistics companies couldn\u2019t operate. You had to have a car or Keke [tricycle] to do what the bikes were doing. So deliveries within Kaduna were halted for some time because I had to look for another means of delivering my items.\n\nAnd the thing with having a business online is that apart from the price of the item, some people get discouraged when they hear the cost of delivery. Delivery within Kaduna used to cost \u20a6500 ($1), but the people using cars were charging \u20a61,000 ($2) or \u20a61,500 ($3). So it\u2019s either you increase the delivery fee, or you take out of the profit you\u2019re making from your business. Then I got a Keke guy.\n\nFor deliveries outside Kaduna to certain places like Abuja, I like using public transport and a car costs \u20a61,500. But those ones are a bit tricky because you can\u2019t track them. You have to keep calling the driver, and sometimes they switch off their phones. Or you take it to the motor park, and they put it in another car.\n\nThere was an item I sent to Jos last year, but it ended up in Sokoto; I still don\u2019t understand it. And then, because of kidnapping issues, some of the cars don\u2019t arrive until late at night. So I had to get someone at the holding park in Mabushi [Abuja].\n\nFor any place outside Abuja, I strictly use GIG Logistics because you can track the packages, and so far, I am satisfied. I\u2019ve been using GIG since last year, and I\u2019ve had only one issue when they mixed up my packages.\n\nHave you tried other companies?\n\nI tried DHL, but it wasn\u2019t working out because they\u2019re very expensive. A good example is Maiduguri, where I send items using regular public transport. I used DHL three times when their rates were still reasonable, but with the fuel scarcity and increase in fuel price, their rates have gone up. I think one month, when I wanted to send a package, they told me it would cost \u20a68,000 ($18).\n\nHow much is the cloth the person bought? With public transport, you pay like \u20a62,000 ($4), and it gets there.",

          "text": "Nigerians are now adopting survival strategies as the cost of preparing a pot of Jollof rice \u2013 a popular Nigerian delicacy has increased by 22.2 percent in one year, the latest Jollof Index report shows.\n\nBusinessDay analysis of the report published by SBM Intelligence \u2013 an Africa focused geopolitical research and strategic communications consulting firm, shows that the cost for a family of five went up year-on-year by 22.2 percent to average N9,311 in Q2 2022 ( April-June) from an average of N7,618 in the same period of last year. And on a quarter-on-quarter basis, it also rose by 8.3 percent.\n\nInflation has risen by an annual rate of 18.6 percent, shrinking consumer wallets still recovering from COVID-19 shocks.\n\nThe report attributed the continued increase to fuel scarcity, continued foreign exchange restrictions, increased insecurity and the effect of global events, especially the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cThe national average shows that prices continued to rise up till June. Prices of seasoning, curry, pepper, vegetable oil, turkey and onions increased in most markets,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIn terms of places, it costs the most to make a pot of jollof rice in Bauchi, at N11, 600, while Bayside Mbakpa in Calabar accounts for the lowest cost at N6, 920.\n\nThe SBM Jollof Index is a composite index that tracks how much it costs to make a pot of Jollof rice across 13 markets in nine states in the six geopolitical zones for a family of five or six, the average rural and urban family size in Nigeria.\n\nThe commodities that makes-up the index are rice, groundnut oil, chicken or turkey, beef, seasoning, pepper, tomatoes, salt and onions. While the index has treaded close to food inflation since collection began in 2016, it has provided a simple way of communicating the realities of inflation to the Nigerian public.\n\nThe report also revealed that Nigerians are devising several coping strategies to deal with the constant increases in food prices depending on the household\u2019s previous economic status, as the gap between the poor and the rich widens.\n\nOne of the respondents, a 50-year-old restaurant owner, explained that she supplements her inability to buy enough proteins with flavours.\n\n\u201cNobody plays with chicken or turkey these days, so you have to buy plenty of flavours, depending on what fits your food, whether goat meat flavour, chicken flavour, masala curry and all that stuff, they cover up for the taste.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nigerians voice frustrations over cost of living crisis\n\nAnother one spoke of how she complements her cooking with different flavours to cover the absence of protein sources like meat and chicken.\n\n\u201cThe result is that more people are slipping below the poverty line. Not only that, many are compromising their health as they choose food quantity and availability over quality and necessary dietary requirements,\u201d the report noted.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, food inflation (prices), rose year-on-year by 20.6 percent in June 2022, the highest in 11 months, when compared to 19.5 percent in the previous month.\n\nThe World Bank predicts that the country\u2019s inflation is likely to push an additional one million Nigerians into poverty by the end of 2022, on top of the six million Nigerians that were already predicted to fall into poverty this year.\n\nIn another interview conducted in 10 states across the country such as Abuja, Anambra, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, Imo, Kogi, Lagos, Rivers and Sokoto, SBM noticed that the present economic condition has affected the diet of children, as most of them are now showing signs of malnourishment.\n\nOne of the interviewees, a teacher in Port Harcourt said that she observed that her students have been coming to school with reduced rations of food and snacks.\n\n\u201cSome don\u2019t even come with food or snacks at times, and the food that some of the poorer children bring to school does not look nutritious.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the poor kids she teaches have been losing weight lately.\n\nA staff member of the state university in Edo said that he currently has challenges feeding his family as he has not been paid for seven months.\n\nAccording to him, some of his colleagues are suffering the same fate. \u201cSo why will you not see children with malnutrition when there is no sufficient money for a balanced diet?\u201d he asked.\n\nTo combat the rising food prices, the report recommends that it is important that the federal government tackles insecurity while also boosting domestic food production.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to assist states that are rich in producing certain major agricultural products. All concerned actors should ease the supply chain to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks involved in the distribution and supply of some food items.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgencies in charge should also check price control and hoarding to ensure that producers, wholesalers and retailers do not exploit the masses in the name of food shortage,\u201d it concluded.",

Jean-Pierre said that the President was experiencing \u201cvery mild symptoms.\u201d The president had previously tested negative on Tuesday.\n\nShe said that Biden had started taking Paxlovid, an antiviral pill that can reduce the risk of hospitalisation for people who test positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe president\u2019s symptoms include a dry cough, a runny nose, and fatigue, White House physician Kevin O\u2019Connor said in a memorandum. Those symptoms began Wednesday evening, O\u2019Connor said.\n\nMeanwhile, Jill Biden, the US first lady, told reporters in Detroit, Michigan, on Thursday morning that her husband is \u201cfeeling good.\u201d\n\nThe Press Secretary said that Biden will work in isolation until he tests negative for the virus.\n\nEFCC to arraign Ex-Accountant General Idris on July 22\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will today arraign Ahmed Idris, a former Accountant General of the Federation, and three others on charges of stealing N109.4 billion.\n\nThe others to be arraigned alongside the AGF are Godfrey Olusegun Akindele, Mohammed Kudu Usman, and Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited before Justice Adeyemi Ajayi of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja.\n\nWilson Uwujaren, the spokesperson for the EFCC, said in a statement on Thursday that the four will be arraigned on 14 counts, two months after Idris was arrested by the EFCC.\n\nRead also:Accountant-General\u2019s N80bn saga shows IPPIS is fraud \u2013 Emmanuel Osodeke\n\nPeter Obi asks court to dismiss PDP\u2019s case\n\nPeter Obi, the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, has asked a Federal High Court in Abuja to dismiss a suit seeking his disqualification on the grounds of nominating Doyin Okupe, his erstwhile campaign manager, as his placeholder.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had earlier asked the court to stop Obi from replacing Okupe as his running mate.\n\nAccording to the PDP, it was wrong for Obi to have used Okupe as a placeholder. A similar suit was filed against Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress who used Masari as his placeholder.\n\nFor want of requisite jurisdiction, Alex Ejesieme (SAN), Obi\u2019s counsel who was responding to the originating motion, is seeking an order of the court striking out or dismissing PDP\u2019s suit.\n\nThe objection by Obi to the PDP\u2019s prayers is based on the fact that the PDP\u2019s suit is speculative, conjectural in nature, and devoid of hard facts.\n\n18 people killed in police raid on Rio Favela, Brazil\n\nThe gang violence that has characterised much of Brazil\u2019s urban areas continued unabated Thursday morning as 18 people were reportedly killed following a raid by the local police force against a criminal gang that controls one of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s most violent favelas.\n\nAccording to the BBC, four hundred heavily-armed military police were deployed to the Alem\u00e3o favela in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nSixteen of the dead were suspected criminals, while a police officer and a bystander were the other two victims, officials said.\n\nThe operation lasted all day and left thousands trapped in their homes.\n\nAccording to the police, the raid was to locate and arrest criminals who were planning operations in rival slums.\n\nSome of the targets were wearing uniforms similar to military police, which made them harder to spot, local media outlet O Dia reported.\n\nThe 400 officers were backed up by 10 bullet-proof vehicles and four helicopters.\n\nLocals were seen carrying injured people into vehicles as police watched.\n\nBrent gains despite continued uncertainty in oil market\n\nBrent crude futures picked up some steam on Friday morning as it rose above $105 per barrel after falling for two straight sessions.\n\nThe gains came despite the troublesome week in the oil market as traders navigated around the challenges brought about by persistent supply-side issues. These issues also weaken US gasoline demand and raise the possibility of a global economic slowdown.\n\nAccording to Trading Economics, President Joe Biden failed to secure a pledge from Arab leaders this week to pump more oil despite remarks from a top US energy envoy indicating confidence that major producers have spare capacity and are likely to boost supplies.\n\nIn a phone call on Thursday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly discussed continued cooperation within OPEC+.",

          "title": "Obaseki and Senate Bill to allow States Generate, distribute Electricity \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIn June 2017, Governor Godwin Obaseki announced to the world that in six month\u2019s time, his administration would provide uninterrupted power supply to B\u00e9nin City and environs. According to his plans, government establishments on Sapele Road axis, including Government House, Secretariat, Court Complex, Central hospital, House of Assembly and also the Oba of B\u00e9nin Palace, will enjoy the 24 hours power supply.\n\nObaseki was quite assured that he would deliver on his promise in record time. He gave the assurance after he entered a power purchase agreement with Ossiomo Power and Infrastructure to bulk purchase the five megawatts the firm planned to generate from its 50 megawatts plant at Ologbo in Ikpoba-Okha local government area which BEDC has frustrated. The megawatts was expected to be transmitted on a new 35-kilometre double circuit 33Kva line to deliver 24/7 uninterrupted power.\n\nThe senate has passed the electricity bill 2022 that would allow states to generate and distribute power as well as solve the sector\u2019s challenges. The bill was passed recently after the consideration of a report by the senate committee on power.\n\nGabriel Suswam, chairman of the committee, said the bill sought to provide an ideal legal and institutional framework to leverage the modest gains of the privatisation phase of the electric power sector in Nigeria. Suswam said that it would minimise aggregate value chain losses in the sector when signed into law. He also said there is no need for anyone or firm generating electricity below one megawatt to get a licence, adding that the new law would allow states or individuals with capacities to generate their power.\n\n\u201cSince electricity is on the concurrent list in the constitution, the bill has allowed state governments to license people who intend to operate mini-grids within the states,\u201d he said. According to the lawmaker, the piece of legislation will reinvigorate the institutional framework for the reform of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) initiated and implemented by the federal government.\n\nAhmad Lawan, president of the senate, midway through consideration of the bill, sought to know the role and operational capacity of banks that had taken over Distribution Companies (DISCOs) indebted to them. Responding, Suswam explained that the takeover of entities (DISCOs) by banks was duly carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and Bureau of Public Enterprise (BPE).\n\nAccording to him, there is a transitional process put in place during the take-over of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) by the United Bank for Africa (UBA) to ensure efficiency in service delivery. He noted that such a process usually involved invitation of new investors to scale up generation and distribution capacities. Suswam further disclosed that the federal government had disbursed 100 million dollars to Siemens to kickstart transmission in the distribution end of the power sector.\n\nThe Edo State House of Assembly has passed a bill to repeal the Rural Electricity Board Law of 1972 to re-enact a new law that makes provision for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for the residents of Edo State, paving the way for the establishment of an electricity market in the state. The Assembly unanimously adopted all six parts of the bill during a session of the committee of the whole on Tuesday, July 19, 2022. The Speaker, Rt. Hon. Marcus Onobun, directed the Assembly Clerk to forward clean copies of the bill for assent to Governor Godwin Obaseki.\n\nThe passed bill provides for the liberalization of the electricity market in the state, allowing for a more pragmatic approach to rural electrification and expansion of distribution infrastructure in the state. The passing of the bill spells better days for electricity consumers in the state, who will now benefit from proper regulation of the electricity sector in the state, which would allow operators a more predictable business environment.\n\nIn the new regime, electricity providers in the state with Generation License, Independent Electricity Distribution Network License and Eligible Customer (willing buyer-willing seller) approval from the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) would reap the full benefit of a liberalized electricity market.\n\nThe new regime will usher in by the new bill will create room for expansion of the off-grid operations of operators such as Ossiomo Power Company which enjoys a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the government. \u201cA lot is going to change. We will have a lot more certainty in the market as there is a state-level regulation for power operations. With this, the likes of Ossiomo Power Company which is already powering public utilities and industrial clusters would be assured of better regulation and would have the confidence to expand. We expect to see more players in the industry.\u201d\n\nThere is need for President Buhari to adopt Governor Obaseki\u2019s power model of power distribution in Edo State. There is competition between Ossiomo and BEDC in Edo State. There is alternative electricity in Edo State today. Nigeria needs this model to solve the electricity challenge.\n\nThe electricity market in Edo State is taking a turn for the better as increased competition among players has created options for reliable power supply to residents, who credit the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, for opening up the state for investment that has now improved their living standards.\n\nChecks in the Benin metropolis have revealed that the two major power distribution companies in the state, Benin Electricity Power Distribution Company (BEDC) and Ossiomo Power Company are in a fierce battle for the customers with the competition assuring better power options to residents.\n\nIt was discovered that with the improvement of distribution infrastructure by Ossiomo Power in select areas in the Benin metropolis, residents are opting for the company\u2019s power solution with the supply averaging 22-24hrs/day. \u201cThe industrial areas are even better served because they need electricity to keep the machines running, which is not what you get everywhere in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is great that BEDC, which used to dominate the market, now has a competitor. With this, we have a more stable market situation as people are now provided with options when considering power solutions in their homes or industries. Those who will benefit the most are industries, hotels, and others in the hospitality sector.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki had disclosed that Edo State has developed plans to help overcome the challenges of power distribution to industries, residential buildings and other users. BEDC has misunderstood this and trying to frustrate the effort of the governor in providing electricity to the people of Edo State. This includes building areas of use, that is, developing industrial parks, housing estates and other clusters that can be directly connected to generating plants.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen these plans are fully achieved, the state would have steady power supply to support businesses and other users. With time, Benin City and other towns in the state will be better planned and segregated so that industrial use of power can be separated from domestic use.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen this is done, the structural challenges along the chain of generation and distribution will then be reorganised and steady power supply will then be guaranteed,\u201d he said. He explained that steady power supply cannot be achieved overnight until the structural impediments are addressed, noting, \u201cEven if the issue of generation of power is addressed, efforts must be made to address issues mitigating distribution and transmission.\u201d\n\nObaseki is setting new boundaries for power generation in Edo State which Benin Electricity DisCo (\u201cBEDC\u201d or \u201cBenin Disco\u201d) which is one of the successor distribution companies (DisCos) created following the unbundling and privatization of the state-owned Power Utility, Power Holding Company of Nigeria Plc highly misunderstood. BEDC misunderstood Obaseki who has introduced systems approach to quantifying the value of power generation and energy storage technologies in future electricity networks. A new approach that required to determine a technology\u2019s value to the power systems of the 21st century. The centrepiece of the system value (SV) concept is a whole electricity systems model on a national scale, which simultaneously determines the ideal power system design and unit-wise operational strategy.\n\nObaseki had accused the BEDC of writing petitions against the deal sealed for the purchase of five megawatts of electricity to light up government offices in Benin City. The governor, who said the petitions have hindered the success of the purchase agreement, decried the poor supply of electricity to the state, the company\u2019s resolve not to supply pre-paid meters to electricity consumers and its culture of over-billing its clients.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201c195 communities have never seen electricity as BEDC is not ready to extend electricity to these communities. 128 communities have issues of collapse of infrastructure which BEDC is not prepared to fix. 219 transformers purchased by the state government and the former Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) as replacements for faulty transformers are yet to be installed by BEDC.\n\n\u201cThe people are over-billed with the estimated billing system of BEDC. We lost a student due to the negligence of BEDC, for refusing to fix a pole that was knocked down after receiving money to fix it. I have instructed the Attorney General of Edo State to file charges of criminal negligence against the senior management of BEDC,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nThe electricity sector in Edo State is undergoing an unprecedented transition which BEDC has failed to utilize. Today, Ossiomo power is providing affordable, secure and reliable electricity by attracting investors with low risk, stable returns. BEDC has not taken advantage of the liberal investment incentives here and improved power supply from Ossiomo. BEDC cannot provide electricity for industrial customers, for processing, producing, or assembling goods including diverse industries such as manufacturing, mining, agriculture.\n\n_____________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald, Benin City inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026 urges support for realisation of EMOWAA\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, said there is no dispute between the state government and the Palace of the Oba of Benin, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, over the return of looted Benin artefacts.\n\nObaseki made the clarification while addressing participants at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement and unveiling of phase one of the Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nThe governor noted, \u201cWhat is our plan for culture? As a people, we have a lot of assets from our past and it\u2019s our responsibility to recreate them. So, it is beyond just several pieces of artwork; no, it\u2019s beyond that. It is about using that as the contact point to bring out the best of who we are.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole lot of research that still needs to be done. We can\u2019t have things about us being explained to us from Europe. Nobody is going to do it for us.\n\n\u201cThat is why we must insist that when these works come, we host them here in Edo State, their home, so that it\u2019s available for everybody to see. There is no quarrel with the palace.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about us but the people of the state. So, let\u2019s facilitate it so everybody can access and benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t see why we cannot achieve this. So, each and every one of you here, from your Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), have the responsibility to make sure we get the first phase of the EMOWAA done and then let those coming after us build on what we have started.\u201d\n\nOn repositioning the culture sector to become a source of revenue for the state, Obaseki stated, \u201cIf we have a million people coming into the state or into Benin City for culture and tourism every year, and each one spends $1000, can you imagine the amount of money that will come into the state? Not from crude oil or the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC), but from culture and tourism.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s another way to look at our development trajectory and please, I am encouraging all to provide whatever support you can to the team. Let\u2019s do it because we must start this work this year and by the time we are leaving office, we should have the first phase completed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the impact of the looted artefacts on the state, the governor said that the invasion of 1897 shocked its system and it\u2019s taking the state almost 100 years to recover.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe invasion of 1897 shocked our system and it\u2019s taking us almost 100 years to recover from that shock. Just imagine a civilization that was intact for more than seven centuries and suddenly it got shocked and the people have been in transition for better parts of the century.\n\n\u201cThat is what we found when we came into the government. So, as a democratically elected government, we owe our people and posterity that responsibility, to first explain who we are and what we have to the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cIf the Egyptians are using what they have to represent the arts of Northern Africa, then we should, as a people, have something to represent the arts of West Africa. It is important to help you understand why we are doing what we are doing and why this project is very significant.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of EMOWAA Trust, Mr. Phillip Ihenacho, said that the core mandate of EMOWAA is to support the preservation of West African heritage and culture.\n\nIhenacho further said that the project will help to empower contemporary creatives by providing infrastructure, research, education and career-building experiences for professionals in the cultural and creative space.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

It is only logical and ideal that after every contest all the aspirants that lost in the contest are brought together for genuine reconciliation with the flag bearer. Last month, instead of calling for reconciliation, the party stakeholders of our local government met at Kaduna under the guise of reconciliation, but the meeting turned out issuing warnings and threats to those that lost in the last primaries should any of them be caught in any anti-party activity in the forthcoming election.\u201d",
          "summary": "Not less than 15 chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kaduna State, on Thursday, dumped the party, citing a lack of internal democracy.\nThe latest party chieftains, who left the party on Thursday, July 21, 2022 were: Mallam Audu Bode, Alh.\nHabila Latu, Boniface Ubandoma, Mr. Yakubu Simon, Jashua Peter, Camio Bitrus, Patrick Paul (Pato), Mr. Samuel Wyah, Zaka Makoshi, Jonathan Fedelix, Barnabas Samuel (Barry), Shua\u2019ibu Yusuf, Alexander Danladi (Lulu), Samuel Ibrahim.\nIbrahim Samuel, in a letter addressed to his Ward Chairman, said, \u201cHis decision to dump the party was based on the internal crises of the party.\n\u201cAnother reason was that the State House of Assembly party primaries has come and gone but certainly not without some avoidable challenges.",

          "text": "A Federal High Court sitting at Maitama, Abuja, has remanded Ahmed Idris, former Accountant-General of the Federation in prison custody, following his alleged complicity in the illegal diversion of public funds to the tune of about N109.4 billion.\n\nJustice A.O. Adeyemi Ajayi, the trial judge, remanded the ex-AGF, after he was arraigned on a 14-count charge that bordered on conspiracy, criminal breach of trust and money laundering.\n\nThe court held that Idris and other Defendants in the matter should remain in custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service till Wednesday when their bail applications will be heard.\n\nOther Defendants in the matter are: Godfrey Olusegun Akindele, Mohammed Kudu Usman and Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited.\n\nMeanwhile, all the Defendants had after they pleaded not guilty to the charge, separately begged the court to release them on bail, pending the determination of the case against them.\n\nChris Uche, SAN, who appeared for the ex-AGF, assured the court that his client would be available to face the charge against him.\n\nUche, SAN, stressed that the EFCC had earlier granted administrative bail to the Defendant who he said flew into Abuja from Kano state immediately he was notified about the arraignment.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of this nature that the Defendants have been on bail, and since there is no complaint that they violated the administrative bail conditions, I pray that they be allowed to continue to enjoy same\u201d, Uche submitted.\n\nBesides, he drew the attention of the court to the fact that the EFCC earlier seized the international passport of his client.\n\n\u201cThis court has the power to grant bail in a matter of this nature, either by oral application or by a formal application.\n\n\u201cMoreover, we have also filed a formal bail application which we also served same on the Prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe prisons are already saturated and unsafe\u201d, Uche added.\n\nLikewise, counsel to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants urged the court to accede to the request for bail.\n\nHowever, the Prosecution counsel, Mr. Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, told the court that he would need time to respond to the Defendants\u2019 bail applications.\n\nRotimi argued that allowing the Defendants to go home after their arraignment, without hearing and determination of their formal bail applications, would send a wrong signal to the society.\n\n\u201cTo ask them to go home without coming to argue the application for bail will send a wrong signal to the society that if a less important citizen is arraigned, such person would be made to suffer.\n\n\u201cHaving filed the application, we need to react to what they said, especially on the issue that they were granted administrative bail and they complied to it\u201d.\n\nThe Prosecution counsel further argued that the administrative bail that was granted to the Defendants, ended immediately the charge was filed against them.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge my lord not to be persuaded by submissions of the defence lawyers\u201d, Jacobs added.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Ajayi ordered that the Defendants should be remanded at the Kuje Correctional Center.\n\nTwo of the counts in the charge against the Defendants, read: \u201cThat you, Ahmed Idris between February and December, 2021 at Abuja in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, being a public servant by virtue of your position as the Accountant General of the Federation accepted from Olusegun Akindele, a gratification in the aggregate sum of N15.1 billion which sum was converted to the United States Dollars by the said Olusegun Akindele and which sum did not form part of your lawful remuneration but as a motive for accelerating the payment of 13% derivation to the nine oil-producing sates in the Federation, through the office of the Accountant General of the Federation, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 155 of the Penal Code Act Cap 532 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990 and punishable under the same section\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat you, Ahmed Idris while being the Accountant General of the Federation and Godfrey Olusegun Akindele while being the Technical Assistant to the Accountant General of the Federation between February and November, 2021, at Abuja in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, in such capacity, entrusted with certain property, to wit: N84.390 billion committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property, when you dishonestly received the said sum from the Federal Government of Nigeria through Godfrey Olusegun Akindele trading under the name and style of Olusegun Akindele & Co., and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 315 of the Penal Code Act Cap 532 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990\u201d.",

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, has addressed the controversy surrounding his choice of Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, Delta State governor, as running mate, noting that he did not reject Nyesom Wike, Rivers State governor as being speculated.\n\nAtiku who spoke in an exclusive interview with Arise TV which was aired Friday morning, said he chose who he felt could deliver among the nominees that were presented to him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t reject Wike, I picked who can deliver. Wike is brilliant and tenacious. Going by history, I picked an Igbo as running mate in 2007, in 2019. I still picked an Igbo as running mate for 2023,\u201d Atiku said.\n\n\u201cThe committee that presented the three nominees was chaired by the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom. They recommended three people, so I picked one. People should be fair to me and state the facts.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of resolving issues with Wike, Atiku said the party was talking to Wike.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching out to Wike and we are talking with him and I believe very soon we will find a reconciliation. In fact, very soon, because we are talking to him.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to his governor colleagues. I am very optimistic we are going to resolve our internal crisis and move on.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI have contested this presidency a couple of times and I don\u2019t try to blame anybody, I accept the outcome or go to court,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nAtiku also noted that he was driven by the passion to serve the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m driven by passion and desire to give back to this country. I\u2019m driven by the passion to give back to this country because of what the country has done for me.\n\n\u201cWith what I have been able to accomplish at my age, I don\u2019t desire any other thing other than the passion to serve my country.\n\nSpeaking on zoning, Atiku said the PDP had never agreed to zone presidency to the South, noting that there was no concession like that.\n\n\u201cWe never zoned to any part of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Atiku said Obi did not consult him before joining Labour, but only informed him after he had declared for the party.\n\nAsked whether he misses the former Anambra State governor, Atiku signed and said, \u201cUnfortunately he did not consult me.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president, however, noted that it would difficult for Obi to win power under Labour Party.\n\n\u201cIt will take a miracle for Labour Party with no structure in the grassroots to win the presidency. In the north 90% of our people are not in tune to Social media,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said Muslim-Muslim ticket made him reject Asiwaju Bola Tinubu when he wanted to be his running mate in 2007.\n\nAtiku fell out with Obasanjo in the bid to succeed him, but later clinched the presidential ticket of Action Congress (AC), a party that Tinubu was instrumental to its formation after the political \u201cTsunami\u201d that hit Alliance for Democracy (AD) governors who were elected in 1999.\n\nTowards the end of his second term as governor of Lagos, Tinubu laid the groundwork for the establishment of AC, the platform on which Babatunde Fashola, incumbent Minister of Works and Housing, was elected as his successor.\n\nDuring the running battle with Obasanjo, Atiku defected from the PDP and clinched the AC presidential ticket.\n\nHowever, he came a distant third in the election, which was won by the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, President Muhammadu Buhari of the then All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP) came second.\n\nAtiku said in the interview that the Muslim-Muslim ticket, which is generating a controversy in the country at the moment, made him not to choose Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThe Muslim-Muslim ticket has always been my fundamental disagreement. Nigeria is a multiethnic and multi-religious nation and there should be a religious balance in our leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu, who will square off with Atiku in the 2023 Presidential election, chose Senator Kashim Shettima, a fellow Muslim as running mate and this has been generating controversy.\n\nWhen asked about his relationship with Tinubu, Atiku said, \u201cI\u2019m still a friend of him and being friends with him doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have our political differences.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, Atiku proposed the decentralisation of power, noting that both generation and transmission should be decentralized.\n\nHe said doing so would allow each region to generate power through the a more efficient way, such hatred as Eastern region coal and Northern region, hydro.\n\nHe also said the NNPC should be privatised for better efficiency.",

          "text": "Number of commercial airlines operating in the nation\u2019s aviation sector have shrunk to eight from 10 in the last one week after the NIgerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), shut down the operations of Dana Air Indefinitely for audit amid financial struggles and recurrent flight incidents.\n\nFollowing the suspension, the airline, on yesterday, said customers who sought refund of their ticket fare should contact the airline for refund.\n\nRecall that on Monday, Aero Contractors, had announced temporary shutdown of its operation due to the high cost of operating, especially, the hike and scarcity of Jet A1 as well as unavailability of foreign exchange to purchase spare parts for grounded aircraft.\n\nHowever, with Aero Contractors, temporarily shut down and Dana Air shut indefinitely by NCAA, airlines presently operating in Nigeria includes, Air Peace airline; Arik Air; Azman Air; Green Africa; Ibom Air; Max Air; Overland and United Nigeria Airlines.\n\nDana Air, it was gathered, was shutdown due to financial struggles as the airline was no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations, as well as, frequent incidents.\n\nFor instance, on Monday, one of the airline\u2019s aircraft, Boeing 737 with registration number (5N DNA), with over 100 passengers bound for Abuja had an engine failure. The aircraft, however, made an emergency landing and the aircraft grounded.\n\nAlso, in May, 2022, the airline, MD-83 aircraft with registration number 5N-JOY, had the tyre of Lagos bound plane bursted and immediately caught fire. The aircraft with 50 passengers on board were immediately evacuated as the pilot aborted takeoff.\n\nHowever, to forestall mishap after recent incidents, the director general of NCAA, Capt. Musa Nuhu, had on Wednesday Night, announced the suspension of Dana Airlines\u2019 Air Transport Licence (ATL) and Air Operator Certificate (AOC) indefinitely, with effect from midnight of Wednesday, 20th July, 2022.\n\nThe suspension, according to NCAA, was made pursuant to Section 35(2), 3(b) and (4) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3(a)(1) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs), 2015.\n\nHe said: \u201cthe decision is the outcome of a financial and economic health audit carried out on the Airline by the Authority, and the findings of an investigation conducted on the airline\u2019s flight operations recently, which revealed that Dana Airlines is no longer in a position to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flight operations.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA acknowledges the negative effect this preemptive decision will have on the Airline\u2019s passengers and the travelling public and seeks their understanding, as the safety of flight operations takes priority over all other considerations.\u201d\n\nIn their reaction, the management of Dana Air, yesterday, disclosed that the recent skyrocketing cost of aviation fuel, Jet A1 at 830/litre, unavailability of forex, inflation are factors that contributed to the suspension of their operation by NCAA\n\nThe airline, in a statement by the communication and marketing manager, Kingsley Ezenwa, expressed readiness and commitment to the course of NCAA\u2019s operational audit, saying the airline is safe, efficient and reliable.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cour operations have been suspended as advised by the NCAA in order to undergo a full operational audit with effect from midnight 20th July, 2022. Operational audits are regulatory and airlines are obligated to suspend their operations when the NCAA calls for it and we understand the impact this suspension will have on our partners, staff, passengers and the general public but we are very confident that we would come out stronger as we have done in the past.\n\n\u201cWe wish to assure the NCAA that we are fully ready and committed to cooperating with them in the course of this audit and to also reassure our customers and partners that we are safe, efficient and reliable.\n\n\u201cThe recent skyrocketing cost of Jet A1 at 830/litre, unavailability of forex, inflation are also contributory factors to this decision regrettably.\n\n\u201cWe crave the understanding and patience of our customers, travel and business partners and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience our short absence from the market might cause.\n\n\u201cOur customer service team will continue to operate 24/7 to assist affected customers with necessary information on refunds and our offices will be open to all our existing partners.\u201d\n\nHowever, stakeholders have said that the airline has been operating at a loss, thereby, making the sustainability of operation very difficult\n\nin an exclusive chat with LEADERSHIP, the secretary general, Aviation Round Table Initiative (ARTI), Olumide Ohunayo, said: \u201cwhen you are in losses you don\u2019t move from losses to profit, but rather, you have to reduce your profit loss first before talking about profit. We are talking about reducing loses first even if they carry full passengers, the loses have been so huge in the past.\n\n\u201cExcept we want to judge it by the weekly or monthly operation but in your financial book, they will look at your end of the year and not weekly operation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a press statement by the communication and marketing manager, Dana Air, Kingsley Ezenwa, said the airline will come out stronger in it operational audit to be embarked upon by the NCAA.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cwe are pleased to announce that we have commenced the operational audit as advised by NCAA and we are fully cooperating with the NCAA to ensure our quick return to flight operations.\n\n\u201cOperational Audits are regulatory and airlines are required to suspend their operations when the regulator calls for it and we are confident that having been successful in previous audits, we will come back even stronger and better.\n\n\u201cThe audit is also an opportunity for us to prove once again and reassure our guests, clients and partners that we remain strong, safe, efficient and reliable.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the forex scarcity, aviation fuel hike and other operational challenges contributed to the crisis that led to NCAA\u2019s suspension of the airline\u2019s licence.\n\n\u201cAs an airline, we are not insulated from the multiple challenges airlines and the aviation industry is grappling with daily which includes the recent skyrocketing cost of aviation fuel at N830/ltr, unavailability of forex, Ground Handling services, inflation, multiple taxation amongst other operational challenges which airlines have made frantic efforts to communicate to the flying public and the government.\n\n\u201cWhile this short stay off the market remains painful and heartbreaking for us, our customers, clients and partners, we remain very hopeful and very confident of our position.\n\n\u201cOur offices will remain open to our travel partners, clients and our customer service will still be operational 24/7 as always to assist customers with necessary information.\n\n\u201cOur customers with unused tickets have also been advised to apply for refunds by sending an email to contact@flydanaair.com with their details and we will try and resolve in a timely manner.\n\n\u201cWish to sincerely apologize to all affected customers, clients and travel partners for any inconveniences caused and crave your understanding and patience in the cause of this audit.\u201d",

          "title": "I did not reject Wike, I picked who can deliver \u2013 Atiku \u2013 P.M. News",
          "text": "The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, said he never rejected Nyesom Wike as his running mate but he only chose an individual that possesses the qualities of a \u201cPresident-in-waiting.\u201d\n\nAtiku stated this in an interview with Arise TV on Friday morning while reacting to the controversies surrounding the choice of his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa, and why he did not choose the Governor of Rivers State.\n\nClarifying his decision to choose Okowa, Atiku said;\n\n\u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our governors, the national working committee, board of trustees, and other leaders to seek their input and their wisdom.\n\n\u201cIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a president-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless All Progressives Congress government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on June 29, 2022, during an interview on Arise TV, said Wike, and others who backed the Rivers governor for the PDP vice-presidential ticket slot deserved a detailed explanation from the party\u2019s presidential candidate on his choice of running mate.\n\nThis was as he also said he had resorted to fast and prayers to seek God\u2019s direction after the emergence of Okowa as the running mate to Atiku ahead of Wike.\n\nOrtom said it was surprising that Atiku could jettison the recommendation of 14 out of 17 members of the committee that recommended Wike as his running mate.\n\nOrtom said, \u201cI am waiting for him (Atiku) because there are more things he is expected to do. I expected him to reach out to Wike who came second and he denied him the popular view of PDP members. 14 out of 17 members say that Wike should be the VP but in his wisdom, he chose Governor Okowa. Governor Okowa is a nice man and my friend and I have no problem with him. But if we are in a democratic era, and 14 people out of 17 said that it should be Wike, and he (Atiku) in his wisdom gave it to Okowa, I expect more explanation, I expect him to talk to Wike first, I expect him to even reach out to some of us so that together we can work as a party.\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line for me is that I have gone into hibernation and I am praying and at the end, whatever God directs me, I can assure you that I will do it.\u201d\n\nReacting to the comments made by Ortom, Atiku said;\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t reject Wike, I picked who can deliver. Wike is brilliant and tenacious. Going by history, I picked an Igbo as running mate in 2007, in 2019. I still picked an Igbo as running mate for 2023.\n\n\u201cThe committee that presented the three nominees was chaired by the Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom. They recommended three people, so I picked one. People should be fair to me and state the facts.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of reconciliation with Wike, Atiku confirmed that talks were ongoing with the Rivers governor.\n\nHe said; \u201cWe are reaching out to Wike and we are talking with him and I believe very soon we will find a reconciliation. In fact, very soon, because we are talking to him.\n\n\u201cWe are talking to his governor colleagues. I am very optimistic we are going to resolve our internal crisis and move on.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI have contested this presidency a couple of times and I don\u2019t try to blame anybody, I accept the outcome or go to court,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nAtiku also noted that he was driven by the passion to serve the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m driven by passion and desire to give back to this country. I\u2019m driven by the passion to give back to this country because of what the country has done for me.\n\n\u201cWith what I have been able to accomplish at my age, I don\u2019t desire any other thing other than the passion to serve my country.\n\nSpeaking on zoning, Atiku said the PDP had never agreed to zone presidency to the South, noting that there was no concession like that.\n\n\u201cWe never zoned to any part of the country,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Kayode Abdulazeez\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele on Thursday commissioned a 600 million naira poultry farm project at the University of Ilorin, Kwara State.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning ceremony the CBN governor, who was represented by Edwin Nzelu, Deputy Director and Secretary to ACGSF, Agricultural credit guarantees scheme fund, said CBN introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on creating decent job, boosting poultry production fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector and One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualized specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cDespite Nigeria being the largest producer of eggs and the second largest producer of chicken meat in Africa, demand gap for eggs and meat stands at and outstrips current supply by 1.2Million Metric Tonnes and 140,000Metric Tonnes for meat and eggs respectively.\n\n\u201cOver the years, this demand gap has driven the smuggling of unhealthy frozen chicken into the country. To close this gap, the Central Bank of Nigeria has introduced various Intervention Schemes focused on boosting poultry production, creating decent jobs, and fostering innovation in the poultry sub-sector. One of such schemes is the Tertiary Institutions Poultry Revival Scheme that was conceptualised specifically for Tertiary Institutions to design and implement viable poultry projects.\n\n\u201cToday we witness the commissioning of the first project to be funded and completed through the Scheme. Certainly, the laudable objectives of the Scheme including improving the revenue of tertiary institutions, employment creation and enhancing research into poultry by tertiary institutions are already being realised\u201d\n\nThe CBN Boss, however, tasked other similar institutions across the country to follow the University of Ilorin example.\n\nIn his speech, the Vice-chancellor of the University of Ilorin, professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem, spoke on how the journey to the realization of the project began and extol the significance of the project in the history of the University.\n\n\u201cThe journey has been long and hard for us as a University. The university took a 600 million naira loan from the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, at a concessionary interest rate of 9% (5% for the first year) and a repayment period of 6 years, with a moratorium on the repayment of the principal for one year. Zenith Bank plc is the participating financial institution on the project.\n\n\u201cAccessing the loan required the University to set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the project. The SPV is Unilorin Bizface synergy Limited, a limited liability company registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the loan, the University worked out an irrevocable standing payment (ISPO) with Zenith Bank plc, ensuring Zenith Bank was paid quarterly the amount due, according to the amortization\u201d, he said.\n\nThe project which is placed on 30 hectares started in February in the year 2022 and was commissioned on 21st July.\n\nThe VC, noted that \u201cthe farm has 6 fully built Broilers\u2019 pens with a capacity, of 5,000 birds each and another two of similar capacity, under construction to raise the total installed capacity to 40,000 Broilers, four fully built layers pens currently housing 17,000 layers, though with an installed capacity of 33,000, a Feed mill with an installed capacity of 5tons/hours, a semi-automated Broiler processing unit (BPU) with a capacity to process 1,000 birds/day and a manure processing unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn job creation, at the height of construction, the site had over 200 artisans earning their daily sustenance from it. Today the farm has 55 full time employees and has created space for students of the hosting institution to work on part time basis\u201d, he further stated.\n\nHe dded that the University is also developing 2,000 hectares of land for Maize and Soya beans cultivation for the exclusive use of the poultry farm\n\nThe vice-chancellor however lauded the project and thanked the steering committee led by the deputy vice-chancellor, research, technology and innovation Professor Mikhail Olayinka Buhari for the efforts put in place to make the project reality and subsequent overseeing of the project.",

          "text": "\u2026 Says Bayelsa Airport Is Not Downgraded\n\nBy Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Bayelsa State Government has made a clarification that the state-owned international airport had not been downgraded, as being insinuated in some quarters.\n\nHe said the absence of scheduled flights to and from the Bayelsa International Airport for a couple of weeks now was not the making or fault of the state government, but has to do with some technical issues with the two airline operators.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, gave the clarification on Wednesday when the Federated Correspondents Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Bayelsa State Council, paid him a courtesy call in Government House, Yenagoa.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo explained that two airlines, Ibom-Air and United Nigeria Airlines, were carrying out what he called D-Check on their aircraft, which had also affected their flight operations from their primary routes.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Governor, the D-Check is a major maintenance check to determine the air-worthiness of an aircraft after it had made commercial flights for a period of 10 years.\n\nHe pointed out that the state government was in touch with the management teams of both airlines, giving the assurance that normal flight operations would resume at the airport before the end of the month.\n\nHis words: \u201cI can assure you that the Governor Diri-led Administration is very much on course. I know that you are going to ask us what is happening to the Bayelsa International Airport.\n\n\u201cThere are a few issues, but they are not really our issues as a government per se. We are aware some persons are pushing the news that the airport has been downgraded. That is not true. The Bayelsa Airport has not been downgraded.\n\n\u201cWhat happened is that the two airlines working with us have gone for D-Check. The D-Check means a plane going for a major maintenance check after it had been put to flight operations for 10 years to determine its airworthiness.\n\n\u201cIf you watch very well, even flights in their regular or primary routes, like the Port Harcourt to Abuja route, have now been reduced to only one daily flight.\u201d\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, who noted that government was doing its best to change the general impression of leadership in the state, said the administration had taken proactive steps to checkmate the impact of the forecast impending large flood.\n\nHe called on the Federated Correspondents Chapel to help push out the good things government was doing in Bayelsa, noting that the Prosperity Administration was not resting on its oars in all sectors ranging from agriculture, sports, health to security.\n\nSenator Ewhrudjakpo, thanked the media for their support to the present administration right from its inception to date and assured the Chapel that government would support their annual lecture slated for November this year.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, however, observed that the standard of journalistic practice was in a steady decline in Nigeria, and therefore, called on the Correspondents Chapel and its parent body, the Nigeria Union of Journalists, to raise the bar.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the state Chairman of the Federated Correspondents Chapel, NUJ, Mr. Tife Owolabi, said the visit was meant to formally introduce the newly elected executive members of the Chapel to the Deputy Governor.\n\nMr. Owolabi, who poured encomiums on the Deputy Governor for being media friendly, prayed the state\u2019s government to carry the correspondents chapel along in its programmes and events, even as he appealed for support towards their annual lecture programme.",

          "text": "By Eunice Nnachi, Yenagoa\n\nThe Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) has launched a novel Niger Delta Talent Hunt (NIDETH) to harness creativity among youths in the entertainment industry and address unemployment in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThe Interim Administrator, NDDC, Dr. Efiong Akwa, who spoke on Wednesday during the inauguration of the programme at the NDDC headquarters in Port Harcourt said it was designed to tackle the challenges and lack of opportunities facing youths in the region.\n\nDr. Akwa commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr. Umana Okon Umana, for supporting activities aimed at harnessing the creative potential of youths in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe entertainment industry is growing bigger everyday. The Nollywood industry occupies a major platform amongst other entertainment industries in the world. When you talk of entertainment the next thing you hear is Nollywood industry in Nigeria. Niger Delta is blessed.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to tell the world that youths of the Niger Delta are the best you can find around the world. They are calm, confident, they seek to excel in whatever endeavour they find themselves.\n\n\u201cIn the field of soccer the youths of Rivers State and Akwa-Ibom are taking the lead; wrestling, Delta and Edo are tops; swimming Bayelsa and Rivers are unbeatable.\n\n\u201cOur focus in this programme is to identify the talented youths, build them up and expose them to the world. We want to use this as an opportunity to provide a platform to expose the hidden talents in the region. If you build the youth, you build the nation.\u201d\n\nDr. Akwa\u2019s Special Adviser on Youths, Engr. Udengs Eradiri, described the Niger Delta youths as enterprising, observing that artistes from the region had challenges of getting support and platforms to express themselves.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe creative industry is one area that we can engage a lot of idle young people. We will continue to play our role in supporting institutions to create the platform to push our young people to the international community. We must keep the creative sector alive in the Niger Delta to develop young talents and to showcase them to the world.\n\n\u201cWe expect that after this process, we will be able to identify unique talents that would be able to showcased to the world. If you look at the entertainment industry you have employment opportunities that are waiting for us.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta youths need to be a part of these opportunities. We need to create engagements so that young people, who have a lot of energy can channel it towards talent development. The work of the NDDC is that of an interventionist agency. It is part of our job to create opportunities for young people to express themselves.\n\n\u201cThe sky is our starting point. We expect that after this talent hunt which is geared towards entertainment, we will be looking at sports\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the NDDC Director, Youths and Sports, Mr. Offiong Ephraim, said that NIDETH was a flagship programme of the NDDC Youths and Sports Directorate aimed at exposing the inherent talents in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe said the talent hunt programme would kick off from the first phase which is Ondo, Edo and Delta State and followed by the other phases with the grand finale taking place in Port Harcourt, Rivers State noting that it would cover the nine states of the Niger Delta Region.\n\nOne of the leading artistes in the region and consultant for the programme, Mr. Okiri Harrison, also known as Harry Song, said that the new NDDC youth programme was a dream come true for those in the creative sector.\n\nHe said that 80 per cent of the entertainment industry was rooted in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe musician said: \u201cIn the entertainment industry, cutting across music, comedy and theatre, the top talents are from the Niger Delta region. The main issue is that most talents remain unharnessed because there is no proper platform to identify and develop them. I am glad because this is where NIDETH comes in\u201d.",

The objection by Obi to the PDP\u2019s prayers is based on four grounds.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s suit is speculative, conjectural in nature and devoid of hard facts, thereby divesting this court of jurisdiction to adjudicate over same,\u201d read the first ground.\n\nNext, Obi\u2019s counsel said that the PDP \u201chas not disclosed any reasonable cause of action to activate the jurisdiction\u201d of the court.\n\nObi\u2019s counsel added that the PDP\u2019s suit \u201cis not situated within the jurisdictional confines of the Federal High Court\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s suit is a gross abuse of court process,\u201d Obi\u2019s counsel added.\n\n\u2014 PDP\u2019s suit \u2014\n\nThe PDP had sued INEC, APC, Tinubu, Masari, Labour Party, Obi and Okupe last week over the use of placeholders and choice of running mate.\n\nThe PDP had held that the term \u2018placeholder\u2019 is unknown to the Electoral Act and that Okupe had admitted publicly that he was a mere placeholder.\n\nIn the suit (Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/1016/2022), the PDP is asking the court to determine if by the combined interpretation of Section 142(1) of the constitution, Section 29(1), 31 and 33 of the Electoral Act 2022, and INEC\u2019s timetable, Tinubu and Obi are bound by the submission of Masari and Okupe as their running mates.\n\nThe party also wants the court to determine if \u201cby the combined interpretation of Section 142(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Sections 29(1), 31, 33 of the Electoral Act 2022, the first defendant (INEC) can validly accept any change or substitution of the 4th (Masari) and 7th (Okupe) defendants as running mates of the 3rd (APC) and 6th (Labour Party) defendants.\u201d\n\nIn all, the PDP is seeking five reliefs from the court, including a declaration that by the combined interpretation of Section 142(1) of the constitution, Section 29(1), 31 and 33 of the Electoral Act 2022 and INEC\u2019s timetable, both Tinubu and Obi must be bound by their submission.\n\nThe party asked the court to rule that both Tinubu and Obi will be disqualified the moment they substitute the names of their running mates.\n\nOne of the reliefs reads, \u201cA declaration that by the combined interpretation of Section 142(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), Sections 29(1), 31, 33 of the Electoral Act 2022, the 1st defendant\u2019s (INEC\u2019s) election timetable, the 3rd (Tinubu) and 6th (Obi) cannot validly contest the 2023 Presidential election without the 4th (Masari) and 7th (Obi) respondents as their respective running mates.\u201d",

The withdrawal is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.\n\nTensions, meanwhile, have brewed with the UN\u2019s peacekeeping force MINUSMA, whose spokesman this week was told to leave the country.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal government has pleaded with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to cancel its planned protest over the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and other university-based unions scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday next week.\n\nIt also urged the organised labour not to mobilise support for Labour Party as it would amount to a violation of the Trade Union Act.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige made the appeal Thursday, during a meeting with the leadership of NLC in his office.\n\nThe Minister said he incorporated NLC into the tripartite conciliation going on in his Ministry, adding that being very much aware of efforts of the government to resolve the impasse, they cannot embark on any rally or protest.\n\nA statement issued by the Head, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Olajide Oshundun, quoted Ngige as having told the labour leaders that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) mandated him to notify them of the serious security implications of the planned protest.\n\nAccording to Ngige, a security report also sent to his office by the Department of State Services (DSS), had strongly warned against holding the protest, slated for July 26 and 27.\n\nHe urged the NLC\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) to reconsider the planned rally, saying hoodlums might take advantage of it to cause breach of security.\n\nNgige also expressed the concern of the government that politicians might hijack the rally to wreak havoc in the country.\n\nFurthermore, Ngige told NLC not go ahead with plans to campaign for the Labour Party in the 2023 General election.\n\n\u201cI heard when you said you are mobilising for Labour Party. But, a trade union is not a political party. Look at the Trade Union Act. It does not allow trade unions to use their contributions to support any political party,\u201d he said\n\nThe minister further said that, \u201cthe masses might wrongly interpret the rally as a ploy by the NLC to enhance the chances of the Labour Party (LP) Presidential candidate, a situation which could spur the supporters of the other political parties into violence.\n\n\u201cSection 40 of the constitution is clear on Freedom of Association. One of the provisions is that people of like minds can organise themselves and form a political party. There is also a provision that people in work or employment can organise themselves into unions. They are two parallels. Parallels don\u2019t meet.\u201d\n\nHowever, the NLC rejected the plea by the federal government, insisting that the two-day national protest would go ahead as planned.\n\nBoth the Deputy President of NLC, Mr. Najeem Usman and General Secretary, Mr. Emmanuel Ugboajah who led the NLC team to the meeting, however assured the government of a peaceful protest by the Congress, saying, \u201cinfiltrators would not be allowed to participate in the protest.\u201d\n\nUgboajah said the NLC appreciates all the efforts of Ngige towards the resolution of the industrial actions in the university system and urged him not to hands off the conciliation.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has vowed that a former governor of the state and the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi as well as the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate for the state, Tonye Cole must face court trial over alleged looting of state\u2019s assets.\n\nThe governor who said Rivers people had resolved to resist individuals who had looted assets of the state from presiding over them as governor, insisted on prosecuting any individual or organisation identified as taking part in looting the treasury of the state.\n\nWike said this on Thursday, shortly after signing the contract for the construction of the 11th and 12th flyover bridges and the dualisation of Azikiwe Street- Illoabuchi Road in Port Harcourt. The contract was signed between the State government and Julius Berger Nigeria Plc at Port Harcourt.\n\nWike said he was determined to safeguard the state from those who are only interested in looting the commonwealth of Rivers people.\n\n\u201cThey can run helter-skelter to stop their arraignment, but they must be arraigned and tried. What Rivers people will hear, Rivers people will be shocked to know what the former governor of the State and Minister did in this state with his partner, Tonye Cole.\n\n\u201cIf they (Ameachi and Cole) like, let them bring 500 Senior Advocates of Nigeria, they will face the trial. So that Nigerians will hear, Rivers people will see how this state was looted\n\n\u201cAnybody can be governor, but not those we have identified that have looted the state treasure. If we can do 12 flyovers from 2019 to now with the little amount of money we are getting, imagine what the previous administration would have done.\n\n\u201cIf the previous administration that had a lot of money had done them, we would have concentrated on other things. But we are still working within the city to change its landscape.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers State governor said alleged looters were desperate to cover their track, maintaining that Rivers people would not allow such persons who do not have the interest of the state to take over its affairs.\n\nWike explained that genuine lovers of the state should be the ones presenting themselves to serve the state as governor not looters.\n\nHe said his style of politics and governance was clearly different from other politicians who take the people for granted and hardly fulfil promises they make.\n\nWike maintained that the good of Rivers people and the state remained the priority of his administration, \u201cwhich is why more projects are still awarded as we prepare to leave office on 29th May 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we are very proud that this administration has kept all the promises made to the people. So, it gives us joy. Some people would have said why not go with the money.\n\n\u201cBut I asked, how much money can you make? What can you amass as against the interest of the people? So for us, we are very happy and anybody who is working with this administration can carry his shoulder high that we have made a difference as far as governance is concerned.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, governor Wike said payment for some of the ongoing projects had almost been completed.\n\n\u201cWe have finished paying for the first phase of the Trans-Kalabari Road; we have finished paying for the dualisation of Bori to Kono Road; we have finished paying for the Ada George- Rumuepirikom flyover; we have almost finished paying for the first phase of Ahoada Road.\u201d\n\nWike told the construction company, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, that excuses would not be tolerated from them because 80 per cent of the contract sum had been released to the company with the monthly N2 billion irrevocable standing order of payment.\n\nThe governor also commended leaders of the state for the immerse support that they had given to his administration to succeed.\n\nIn his speech, Managing Director of Julius Berger, Dr. Lars Richter, said the contract they signed with the Rivers State government was for two new flyover bridges that would be completed in 10 months and the dualisation of Azikiwe Street- llloabuchi Road in six months.\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",

          "title": "Nigeria Challenges Indigenous Oil Firms to Fill Void Created by Divesting IOCs",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has challenged the Indigenous Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) to take advantage of the ongoing divestments by International Oil Companies (IOCs) to significantly increase their investments in oil and gas assets in the country.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, speaking as chairman and special guest at the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE) divestment workshop in Lagos, urged the group to see the exit by IOCs as an opportunity to step in to fill the vacuum in the sector.\n\nThe event was themed: \u201cThe Big Sale: Opportunities in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry from Asset Divestments.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of AA Holdings and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Dr. Austin Avuru, who spoke at the workshop, blamed the drop in Nigeria\u2019s oil production to just a little above one million barrels per day to the decline in capital spending in the industry from $20 billion to a paltry $6 billion per annum.\n\nSpeaking further, Sylva said: \u201cThe IPPG and other potential investors should therefore perceive the IOCs\u2019 divestments in some of the upstream assets as opportunities, rather than threats, to become more involved in the development of the Nigerian upstream petroleum sector.\u201d\n\nSylva urged the IPPG members to strive to move their present contribution in production and reserves to at least 50 per cent, from about 30 per cent for crude oil and 20 per cent for gas production, as well as 40 per cent andcen per cent for oil and gas reserves, respectively.\n\nThe minister who spoke virtually, stated that the federal government was desirous to create the enabling environment for indigenous producers and other interested parties to play big in the ongoing divestments in the sector.\n\n\u201cTo facilitate this, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, in fulfilment of its mandate to promote an enabling environment for investment in the Nigerian petroleum industry as enshrined in section 3 (e) of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), is setting up a one-stop oil and gas investment centre to create an enabling business environment for would-be investors,\u201d he said.\n\nHe assured potential investors that divestments would be adequately managed to ensure that Nigeria remains a prime destination for competitive oil and gas business.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to listen to our stakeholders to ensure the right steer for our industry,\u201d he added.\n\nSylva noted that despite the worldwide clamour for transition to renewable energy sources, it was certain that anticipated economic growth and rising global population, especially in Asia and Africa, would significantly push energy demand upward to a level that renewable energy sources only cannot meet by 2050.\n\n\u201cAs global energy consumption grows, it is apparent that oil and gas will remain significant components of future energy mix.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is ample opportunity for profitable investments into the Nigerian petroleum industry, with its enormous oil and gas reserves of over 37 billion barrels and about 209 trillion cubic feet (TCF) respectively,\u201d he stated\n\nHe stressed that the passage and signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act in 2021 (PIA) has cleared the path of every possible obstacle that would have hitherto hindered investment in the oil and gas sector.\n\nSylva traced divestment in Nigeria\u2019s upstream oil and gas sector by IOCs to 2006, adding that it increased in 2010 mainly due to the hostile environment arising from the menace of crude oil theft.\n\nIn his contribution, Avuru said to reverse the trend of decline in the sector and play catch-up, the industry needs to raise the capital spending to as much as close to $30 billion annually in the next 10 years.\n\nHe declared that the Nigerian oil and gas industry was in dire need of a competent and powerful regulator to manage the current divestments challenge on the sector and the nation at large.\n\nDispelling the impressions by government and many industry stakeholders that the current decline in Nigeria\u2019s oil production was due to oil theft, Avuru said a combination of factors contributed to the poor production performance.\n\nHe explained that the oil production declined started around 2012 when the six big IOCs including Shell, ConocoPhillips, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Chevron and Eni started contemplating of divesting from Nigeria, resulting in their withdrawal from further spending in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to him, that led to a 70 per cent year-on-year drop in the capital spending, adding that it went down from the $20 billion average spending year-on-year over a decade ago to the current $6 billion annually.\n\nAs a result of this drop in spending, Avuru said oil production correspondingly plummeted from a high of 2.6 million barrels per day in the last 20 to 30 years to now one million barrels.\n\nHe said, \u201cYear-on-year, we recorded 70 per cent reduction in spending to a point where we have gone from an average of $20 billion a year to $6 billion a year. That corresponds to the production drop I showed you.\n\n\u201cAnd we have to reverse this $6 billion spend, and to play catch-up, we will not be doing $20 billion a year. We will be doing something closer to $30 billion a year over the next 10 years to play catch-up.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m situating the current decline in production to the date that the big spenders in the industry almost all decided that we are going to leave and because we are planning to leave, we will no longer spend.\n\n\u201cAnd when they (IOCs) don\u2019t spend, that\u2019s what you see. So that\u2019s when it all started and that\u2019s why we are talking about these divestments.\n\n\u201cSo, what really should have happened if the big operators were leaving and therefore stopping the spend that kept the industry going? There arose a critical transition in our industry that should have been managed properly by a forward-looking regulator that will ask itself: while this people are leaving, who is coming in? What is the process?\u201d\n\nTo manage the current transition from the IOCs to the independent companies, which he described as a critical industry transition, Avuru stressed the need to strengthen the regulatory arm in order to reestablish industry efficiency.\n\nHe said at this critical time in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, there was need for a competent and capable regulator that will not be cowered by any force, pointing out that such regulator should have the kind of power and authority as obtained in the nation\u2019s banking and communications sectors.\n\nHe decried a situation where the number of indigenous producers has grown from 10 to 40 and yet producing half of what the 10 producers were producing, stating there was the need to sieve the grains from the chaff.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe larger the number, the smaller the production.\n\n\u201cThis is how we have managed the transition. More players, less activities, less production, no business continuity thinking. It\u2019s like asking, what would have happened to our banking industry if central bank did not step in.\n\n\u201cIf you go back to NCC, when Ernest Ndukwe was the Executive Vice Chairman and late Ahmed Joda was the Chairman, that was when this GSM revolution came. They could not even be challenged in what they were doing by the Minister of Communications. So that\u2019s how powerful the regulator was. That\u2019s the regulator we are looking for today.\u201d\n\nHe added that Nigeria has to reestablish transparency and international confidence in the industry in managing the transition and divestments, pointing out that divestments was a global thing.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Isa Modibbo, said divestments by the IOCs was creating opportunities and possibilities for Nigeria\u2019s educated youth.\n\nNoting that he was happy about the ongoing divestments, Modibbo said no country in the world keeps its national patrimony in the hands of a third party.\n\nAdmitting that oil remains a very important tool for national development, in diplomacy and power, he said the world had reached a stage where oil was no longer what it used to be and that technology was becoming the next big thing.\n\nThe NUPRC board chair also warned those, who have no other reason to be in the oil industry except to trade with papers obtained from the organisation to stay away from the industry as no such act would be condoned.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has clarified a statement made by its Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, at Tuesday\u2019s post-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting media briefing.\n\nIt stressed that Emefiele had during the media briefing warned bank customers against converting the naira to dollars for electioneering purposes.\n\nCBN Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi stated this following what he described as attempts by persons to deliberately misrepresent Emefiele\u2019s caution on electioneering spending by the political class.\n\nAt the MPC briefing, Emefiele in response to a question on the impact of election spending had said: \u201cFor election spending as far as we are concerned what we do is to monitor liquidity in the system and once we see that there is excess liquidity we will continue to use our discretionary powers to mop up liquidity in the vaults of the banks so that they will not get involved in speculative activities with those who want to speculate with the currency.\n\n\u201cAs for those who want to be taking naira from their account to buy dollar because of elections, I want to warn, not advise that it is illegal to do so. Whereas it sounds more convenient that you should carry dollars because you can carry a little dollar with a lot of value in your pocket, but if the security agencies hold you know the implication of that we will continue from our own side.\n\n\u201cWe have our own apparatus through which we monitor movement of funds between customer or between banks and customers or from one bank to another. Any bank that we find in those kind of transactions that we consider to be unauthorised or that we consider to be illegal you can be guaranteed that your account will be placed on Post No Debit (PND).\n\n\u201cWhen your account is placed on PND it means you will never be able to conduct banking transactions in any bank in Nigeria. It is a very injurious tool that the CBN uses. CBN has turned itself into a monster that uses an injurious tool to stop you from conducting illegal flows, whether domestic or foreign currency. So I will advise you not to get involved in unauthorised and illegal movement of money from your bank to your account or from your account to another account or in currency conversion. When you do that and you are caught in that practice your account will be placed on PND.\u201d\n\nAccording to Nwanisobi, the warning by the CBN Governor was to those who sought to convert the naira from their accounts into foreign currencies for election campaign and not those who seek to exchange the currency for legitimate purposes such as payment for tuition and other personal expenses.\n\nReiterating the bank\u2019s position, the CBN spokesman also frowned at the conduct of unauthorised movement of funds within and outside the country, saying it would use tools at its disposal to check the movement of illicit funds.\n\nWhile maintaining that the bank, in line with its mandate, had discretionary power to prevent persons from conducting unauthorised transactions, Nwanisobi said the CBN was within its statutory limits to mop up the excess liquidity in the vaults of the institutions its regulates, so they do not get involved in speculative activities.\n\nHe, therefore, urged bank customers not to get involved in unauthorised movement of funds for currency conversion in order not to fall foul of the extant laws of the land. Nwanisobi also admonished Nigerians to be more patriotic as it relates to the naira, noting that it was the duty of every citizen to support the CBN in preserving the value of the naira.\n\nNume Ekeghe",
