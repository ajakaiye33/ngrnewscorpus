It will also handle their restitution for certain losses and rehabilitation to allow restoration of peace and justice as well as the promotion of development in the state, and the region/Nigeria.\n\nIt added that given the cross-border nature of the conflict, the focus goes beyond Anambra, and possibly covers the entire South-East.\n\nThe members include: Prof Chidi Odinkalu, Chairman; Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu, Member/Secretary; and Dr. Joe Nwaorgu, member.\n\nOther are Dr. Udenta Udenta, Dr. Uju Agomoh, Rev.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Arrests 23 suspected smugglers\n\nBy Godfrey Bivbere\n\nThe Federal Operations Unit, Zone A of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS said that it has impounded smuggled goods with Duty Paid Value, DPV, amounting to N767 million last month.\n\nThe Unit also disclosed that 23 persons were arrested at various points in connection with smuggling activities during the period under review.\n\nActing Controller of the Unit, Hussein Kehinde Ejibunu who disclosed this during a press briefing where he displayed the seizures and suspects to newsmen, said the Unit collected N89.3 million as revenue within the period.\n\nThe Controller said operatives of the Unit will always be unrelenting in our 24-hour patrols to intercept any means of conveyance of smuggled items, seized them and arrests suspects involved in the act.\n\nHe added that the fight against smuggling will be sustained to protect the nation\u2019s economic and prevention of dangerous goods from entering the country through any entry point in the South West.\n\nHe condemned the killing of Inspector of Customs A. Onwegbuzie by suspected smugglers in Ogun State while discharging his official duties, adding that the long arms of the law will catch up with such murderers who dumped the murdered officer\u2019s body in a pit\n\nEjibunu said \u201cThe fight against smuggling is becoming more and more intense and fierce due to increased level of crime. \u201cSmugglers are more determined than ever before to confront officers on patrol even unprovoked.\n\n\u201cThis new wave of daring attitude of smugglers has claimed the lives of many officers; the latest being the hacking to death with machete of Inspector of Customs Onwegbuzie A. along Senator Road, Ilaro axis of Ogun State after making a seizure on Wednesday 2nd March, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe officer was not only gruesomely murdered but his body was dumped in a deep pit. Interestingly, newspapers were not awash with the report of the incident. Were it the other way round, there would have been noise everywhere.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, with the timely arrival of other patrol teams, three arrest were made in connection with the murder, 78 bags of smuggled parboiled rice at 50kg each and six motorcycles were equally seized.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday 9th March, 2022, a patrol team uncovered several rice barns in a thick bush behind Dangote Cement Factory in Ogun State. The discovery which was made in the night, triggered gunshots from smugglers directed at officers. Officers never bulged and in the morning, evacuated 845 bags of foreign parboiled rice to the station.\n\n\u201cAnother attack took place on Wednesday 16th March, 2022, along Oyan-Oni-Chain, Idere at Ibarapa area of Oyo State after making seizure of 105 bags of foreign parboiled rice at 50kg each. During that attack which was repelled, a fleeing smuggler dropped his locally made pump action rifle with four cartridges which the team brought to the Station.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, a team that intercepted two Toyota Camry vehicles laden with 86 bags of smuggled parboiled rice at 50kg each along Owode/Idiroko road of Ogun State was again attacked by smugglers.\n\n\u201cThe team not only secured the seizure but it also repelled the attackers during which one was shot in the leg and arrested alongside his dane gun and one cutlass. The suspect is currently receiving treatment, but under guard. You can now see the number of attacks just for the month of March, 2022, alone.\n\n\u201cThe situation we have on our hands requires all hands to be on deck. It therefore behoves on all of us to fight this common and dangerous enemy called smuggling\u201d the Acting Controller said.\n\nHe also called on members of the public to share credible information with the service that could forestall smuggling activities and lead to arrest of more smugglers.\n\nFive of the arrested suspects were granted administrative bail while 18 others are at various stages of investigation ahead of likely prosecution.",

We have never had it this bad. The free fall of Naira, the ravaging insecurity in almost all parts of the country, mutual distrust as a people, and an economy in near-comatose.

It will be our common bond as we do away with all colonial relics of division, mistrust and hatred.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo longer will we engage based on Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba or North and South but on the basis of Nigeria, our only fatherland. We will resist all those who make religion and tribe their mantra. It will no longer be business as usual. We will zone out all proponents of zoning and usher in a Nigeria that promotes merit, character and knowhow above primordial sentiments.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery component part of Nigeria is blessed with those who have the talents and abilities to pilot the affairs of Nigeria and we must create the enabling environment for these people to emerge in government and governance. Nigeria will no longer be associated with mediocrity as we will invest in our citizens, our greatest asset. The toga of lazy youths won\u2019t stand as we build the greatest workforce on earth. We must build a workforce that knows today and understands the demands and dictates of tomorrow. We can no longer be in conflict with what we don\u2019t know as we make policy somersaults over modern age financial instruments like bitcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot be seen to be banning and unbanning platforms like twitter that define the expression of the modern man. No longer will our citizenry be driven to the dark web and unconventional means of communications as they seek to hide from a repressive Government.\n\nGovernment is and should be a big brother and not a big bully. Millions of our citizenry still live without light and potable water in the year 2022. This is unconscionable.\n\n\n\nOn power generation and distribution, Kachikwu said: \u201cThere is no rocket science to generating power, neither is there magic in distributing power. Our debilitating challenges are man-made and we must use an iron fist in crushing those whose decades of evil practice in our public service space have led us to the brink. We will treat those who sabotage our nation and way of life as saboteurs.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also promised to stop public servants from foreign medical treatment and their wards from schooling abroad, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t have different rules for different criminals. If you do the crime, you do the time. If given the privilege to lead you my first executive interface with the National Assembly will include a bill, I have dubbed the Nigerian Patriot Act. It is a bill of equality and fairness. It is a bill that says we are all in this together. It is a bill that would ensure that public servants cannot use the privileges they cannot provide for the common man.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you desire to be in the public service, you must use the same services the masses use. No private or foreign schools for our families, no private or foreign hospitals for us or our families, no generators or boreholes in our homes. If we desire efficient and effective education, healthcare, utilities, etc we must make it available to all so that we may all equally benefit from it, \u201c Kachikwu said.\n\nRELATED NEWS",

          "title": "2023: PDP has commited suicide \u2013Ohanaeze",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nApex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, described the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as a betrayer saying it committed political suicide by throwing its 2023 presidential ticket open to all aspirants, irrespective of geopolitical zone.\n\nA 37-member zoning committee of the PDP, chaired by Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom in its report to the National Working Committee of the party failed to zone the slot.\n\nBut President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor wondered why the PDP decided to jettison zoning when it was the turn of the South, and particularly the South East.\n\nHe described the decision as \u201cunconscionable political blunder and betrayal\u201d of the Igbo given the price they have paid supporting the party over the years.\n\nObiozor stated this in a statement signed by the group\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia condemning \u201cin its entirety the political suicide that has been committed by the PDP by its position on zoning.\u201d\n\nFor purpose of clarity, he stated that rotation and zoning principle was engrained into the PDP\u2019s Constitution in 2009.\n\nAccording to him, article 7 (2) (c) of the PDP Constitution states: \u2018In pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness, the party shall adhere to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices, and it shall be enforced by the appropriate executive committee at all levels.\u2019\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe said that such unscrupulous violation of the zoning principle that has been well entrenched in the PDP constitution simply changed the rules of the game in order to deprive Ndigbo the opportunity to produce a president for Nigeria.\n\nObiozor said history was never kind to betrayers and the treacherous, stressing that the machinations and conspiracies to deny the Igbo their due place in Nigeria was an ingratitude that daily cried to God.\n\nHe urged all the Igbo presidential aspirants to remain focused and undaunted because of the PDP shenanigans, pointing out that history will always vindicate the just.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide reiterates the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark that any party that does not zone it presidential ticket to the south should not expect the support of the Middle Belt and the entire South. It is therefore curious that the PDP should commit political hara-kiri at a time it is struggling for a fresh air. It is unfortunate that the PDP glomourises inordinate ambitions; any political ambition that undermines nation building should be checkmated.\n\n\u201cLet it be known that it runs contrary to the indomitable Igbo spirit to swallow any form of indignity, disdain or condescension from anybody or group. It is therefore highly inconceivable that the Igbo will validate a party or group that runs roughshod over its sensibilities.\u201d\n\n\u2026We\u2019ll not support northern candidate \u2013Afenifere, MBF\n\n\u2022PDP\u2019s action amounts to justice, equity, fairness \u2013AYCF\n\nBy Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere and Middle Belt Forum (MBF) have reiterated their earlier position that they would not support any presidential candidate from the north in 2023, insisting that after President Muhammadu Buhai\u2019s eight years in power as a northerner, power should naturally shift to the south.\n\nReacting to Ohaneze Ndigbo\u2019s assertion that the PDP has committed political suicide by throwing its presidential ticket open to all zones, , Afenifere said it would not be drawn into the partisan affairs of what the party did or did not do.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nBut, the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Jare Ajayi, however, reiterated the position adopted by the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), under the leadership of Chief Edwin Clerk and the Southern Governors Forum led by Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu that power should shift to the south in 2023.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, agreed with Ohanze\u2019s position that what the PDP had done amounted to a political suicide.\n\n\u201cWe said we would campaign against any political party that chose a northern candidate and if through this open process, a northern candidate emerges, it would amount to a political suicide because the Pan Niger Delta Elders Forum (PANDEF), Ohaneze, Afenifere and Middle Belt Forum will all campaign against the candidate, and that, by implication, means that PDP is gone. So, throwing the contest open actually amounts to a political suicide unless if they succeed in electing a southern candidate during the primary,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, President of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima disagreed with Ohaneze\u2019s assertion of PDP committing political suicide saying there was nothing like political suicide in what the PDP has done.\n\nHe said on the contrary, the party\u2019s action amounts to justice, equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe party knew that it was morally wrong to zone the presidency to the south; it also has no moral right to zone it to the north. The last president came from the south and in the 16 years of PDP in power, the north has only three years. And if you combine Buhari\u2019s administration as a northerner, though from the APC, together with that of late Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua of the PDP, and you zone the presidency to the south, some of us will still feel that the right thing was not done and justice was done to the north. The south cannot have 14 and half years in power while the north has 10 and half years and they say justice has been done to the north; there is nothing justice about that.\u201d\n\nHe questioned the imperatives of zoning saying, \u201cIn what way has the zoning favoured anybody since we started it Nigeria? Look at what we are going through in Nigeria today. I has never favoured anybody and that is why we are saying that enough is enough. Let us begin to look at competence, no matter where the person comes from, rather than zoning.\u201d\n\n\u2026Final decision rests with NEC \u2013Ortom\n\nBy Sunday Ani\n\nContrary to what has been widely reported in the media that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has jettisoned its zoning arrangement and thrown open the contest for its presidential ticket for the 2023 poll to all geopolitical zones, Chairman of the party\u2019s 37-man zoning committee and Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has debunked the report.\n\nOrtom said the committee only submitted its recommendations to the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC), which has the final decision on whether the presidential ticket should be zoned to the south or north or thrown open to aspirants from all geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nHe stated this on a Channels Television programme, yesterday.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that the committee\u2019s work at our own level has been concluded; it is now left for the NEC to decide on what they think is the best for the party and Nigerians. We have just made a recommendation to the NEC, but it will now take a final decision. I think that NEC will soon invite us to a meeting because in any case most members of the committee are also members of NEC. So, at NEC, there will be robust discussions on what will help Nigerians and what will help the party to win in 2023,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nOn whether the party had not taken the wrong step by contemplating whether to jettison zoning or abide by it as has been the tradition of the party, Ortom said: \u201cWe have not shot ourselves in the foot and we will not do that. We listen to the people; we are grassroots-oriented and we want to make sure that whatever we do reflects the interests of our people in the PDP and the interests of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlthough he agreed that there could be some dissenting voices if zoning is finally jettisoned based on where such persons come from and their collective interests within their constituency, Ortom said at the end of the day, they would still come together and look at the larger picture of winning the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about having a candidate, but it is about going ahead to campaign and winning the election so that we can rescue Nigeria and rebuild it. This is our paramount interest for now, but as I said, this is not the final decision. Whatever we have decided, which in our wisdom we have chosen not to make public, we are submitting it to NEC and NEC will deliberate on it, consult and take a final decision. Every average PDP member is concerned about winning the election. We will do whatever we can to give us favour before the people and make things work for us to win the election\u2026There was money in 2015 but did PDP win? Today, we are focusing on ensuring that we get the hearts of the people and in doing so, we must ensure justice, fairness and equity and truthfulness in all that we do. We have emphasised that we will get it right this time by doing the right thing.\u201d",

It is a war of attrition, but our military is living to the billing, working day and night to ensure that the terrorists are neutralised. We will continue to give information on the progress we are making in our fight against terrorism, but we can assure you we are on top of this matter.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, it is the story of second guessing that is going on, and we will continue to give relevant information on the progress we\u2019re making in our fight against terrorism. But we can assure you we\u2019re on top of this matter and in any country in the world, while we are fighting terrorists, the oxygen they need is what is being provided daily, which is, they want to occupy the front page of every newspaper, they want to carry out spectacular attacks even when they are down\u2026 But clearly, the last three, four, five days, the military recorded massive victories against terrorists and bandits, either in the North East or in Kaduna, Niger axis.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Federal Government was listening to Kaduna governor\u2019s comment that the terrorists can be tracked as they listen to their conversations, he said: \u201cI know that on Monday, there was a very successful area interjection, where scores of hundreds of bandits/terrorists were eliminated.\n\n\u201cEven when we\u2019re able to identify where the bandits are, sometimes out of fear of collateral damage to the innocent civilians, you choose the time you want to strike. But I just want to assure you that the administration is not unmindful of your anxieties and your concerns. But probably because we are in charge, we can assure you there\u2019s really, really no cause to feel that the government is overwhelmed, not at all.\n\n\u201cWe are not overwhelmed and the last few days, I think has confirmed that. But unfortunately, when we inflict these victories on the bandits, for many reasons, we do not come out and say we have killed so many. Because, it\u2019s continuous. But very soon, Nigerians would feel the impact of these victories.\u201d\n\nHe said the armed forces was given all the financial and moral support by the government to win the war.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved N36.130 billion for the construction of the Keffi-Nasarawa-Toto Road in Nasarawa State.\n\nMinister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who revealed this while briefing State House Correspondents on decisions reached, said: \u201cThe Ministry of Works and Housing presented a memorandum to council for a contract for the rehabilitation of 118.9km Keffi-Nasarawa-Toto road in Nasarawa State and the memo was approved for the award of the contract for N36.130 billion.\u201d",

          "text": "* Says it\u2019s highly inconceivable that Igbo \u2018ll validate a party that runs roughshod over its sensibilities\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo World Wide, Prof George Obiozor, has said the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) has committed political suicide by jettisoning zoning.\n\nObiozor was reacting to the decision of the Governor Ortom-led PDP committee on zoning of its presidential ticket to throw the party\u2019s ticket open.\n\nThe Ortom committee was reported to have thrown the presidential ticket of the party open to all aspirants from all parts of the country, in violation of the party\u2019s tradition of rotating power between North and South.\n\nSpecifically, Article 7 (2) (c) of the PDP Constitution states: \u2018In pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness, the party shall adhere to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices, and it shall be enforced by the appropriate executive committee at all levels.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Obiozor wondered why the PDP decided to jettison zoning when it was the turn of the South and particularly the South East to produce the President.\n\nDeploring what he called the unconscionable shifting of the goal post at the middle of the game, Obiozor said such unscrupulous violation of the zoning principle that had been well entrenched in the PDP constitution simply changes the rules of the game in order to deprive Ndigbo the opportunity to produce a president for Nigeria.\n\nObiozor described the party\u2019s action as \u201ca political blunder and betrayal given what Ndigbo have suffered in our own country and most recently for supporting the PDP.\u201d\n\nNoting that history has never been kind to betrayers and the treacherous, the Ohaneze leader said the machinations and conspiracies to deny Ndigbo their due place in Nigeria was an ingratitude that cries to God daily.\n\nObiozor said: \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide reiterates the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark that any party that does not zone it presidential ticket to the South should not expect the support of the Middle Belt and the entire South. It is therefore curious that the PDP should commit political hara-kiri at a time it is struggling for a fresh air.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the PDP glomourises inordinate ambitions; any political ambition that undermines nation building should be checkmated. One of the roles of a political party in a democracy is nation building and for the PDP to shirk its responsibilities is an unfortunate path to Golgotha.\n\nLet it be known that it runs contrary to the indomitable Igbo spirit to swallow any form of indignity, disdain or condescension from anybody or group. It is therefore highly inconceivable that the Igbo will validate a party or group that runs roughshod over its sensibilities.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, there is hardly any society that can develop amidst crises. Development is a product, an effect that arises from peace, unity and national coherence. On the other hand, the basics of peace, unity and sustainable national development is justice, equity and human dignity. In order words, to expect sustainable economic development rooted in injustice is mere shadow chasing. This is an irrepressible scientific, philosophical, historical and moral assertion that may be ignored at one\u2019s peril.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide urges all the Igbo presidential aspirants to remain focused and undaunted because of the PDP shenanigans. This is because history will always vindicate the just.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nExpectations were on Wednesday heightened following the decision of a Federal High Court to defer judgment in the suit seeking the removal of Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, and his deputy, Ivara Esu, from office over their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo had earlier fixed April 6, to deliver his judgment in the suit filed by the PDP against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC, Ayade and Esu.\n\nThe PDP had approached the court to challenge the continued stay in office of Ayade and his deputy, having defected from the party which brought them into office as governor and deputy governor.\n\nAfter taking submissions from all lawyers representing parties in the suit, Justice Taiwo then adjourned to March 25 for judgment.\n\nAlthough Justice Taiwo had delivered judgment in a similar suit filed by the PDP against Cross River State federal and state legislators a few days back, however, the court did not sit on the adjourned date of March 25.\n\nThe matter was later rescheduled for April 6 for judgment.\n\nHowever, when the court resumed Wednesday, rather than delivering judgment, Justice Taiwo asked parties to address him on the propriety of his delivery of the judgment taking into consideration the Court of Appeal judgment in the case of Ebonyi State Governor, Mr Dave Umahi, and his deputy, which held that they cannot be removed from office on account of defection.\n\nResponding, the lawyer to the PDP, Chief Emmanuel Ukala (SAN), urged the court to go ahead and deliver its judgment because the issues canvassed in the suit determined by the Enugu Division of the Court of Appeal were quite different from the ones being canvassed by his client, adding that what his client is asking the court to interpret, was not what was presented at the Ebonyi High Court which was the case that the appellate court took a decision on.\n\nHowever, Ayade and his deputy through their lawyer urged the court to decline the delivery of his judgment and submit to the judgment of the appellate court because the issues that the plaintiff brought before it for determination are exactly the same as those already decided by the Court of Appeal.\n\nAfter listening to the arguments of all parties, Justice Taiwo announced that judgment in the matter would be delivered on Thursday, April 7, 2022.\n\nThe appellate court had, in a unanimous judgment delivered on April 1, held that Governor Umahi and his deputy had the right to move to any political party they so wished, adding that there was nowhere in the constitution that barred a sitting governor from defecting to any political party.\n\nJustice A. O. Belgore, who delivered the judgment, said that the governor and his deputy did not offend any provision of the Constitution or the Electoral Act, as there was no consequence under the law against the defection of the holder of the office of the president, vice-president, governor or deputy governor to another political party from the party that sponsored the election that brought him or her to office\n\nThe Court of Appeal further held that the defection of a political office holder may appear immoral, but it was not the duty of the court to embark on an investigation or probe into the provisions of the laws, warning that judicial activism must not be turned into judicial rascality.\n\nThe appellate court further held that there was no provision in sections 180, 188 or 189 of the 1999 Constitution as amended, that empowered the court to remove either a sitting governor or the deputy.\n\nAccording to the learned Justices, \u201cDefection of an office holder is not novel to Nigeria\u2019s judicial jurisprudence.\u201d\n\nAyade alongside his deputy was elected on the platform of the PDP in 2015 and 2019, but defected to the APC on May 20, 2021, leading to the current suit.\n\nPDP is asking the court to declare that \u201cin view of the provisions of section 221 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the democratic system of governance operated in Nigeria, votes at the election and elections are won by political parties and not their candidate or the candidates sponsored at the election by the political parties\u201d.\n\nThe party is also seeking an order directing INEC \u201cto immediately receive from the plaintiff (PDP), the name of its candidates to replace the 3rd and 4th defendants (Ayade and Esu) for the purpose of utilising the lawful votes cast in favour of the plaintiff or in the alternative directing the 1st defendant to hold a gubernatorial election for Cross River State in accordance with Section 177 of the Constitution (excluding the 3rd and 4th defendants who are disqualified from participating in the election by virtue of Section 192 (1) (b) of the Constitution) arising from the abandonment of the majority lawful votes and the offices occasioned by the action of the 3rd and 4th defendants by reason of their becoming members of the 2nd defendant who did not win majority of the lawful votes cast at the election\u201d.\n\nJustice Taiwo had, in a similar suit filed by the PDP, ordered the removal of two Cross River State House of Representatives members and 18 House of Assembly members for defecting from the PDP to the APC.\n\nJustice Taiwo, in the judgment, held that their continued stay in office having defected to the APC was illegal, unconstitutional and unlawful.\n\nOn Monday, Taiwo Taiwo, a judge, sacked 20 lawmakers from Cross River state who defected alongside the governor to the APC.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Incidentally, the plea did not.\n\nGeorge Mbuagbaw, HAN\u2019s Interim President, said, \"The judge did not seem to consider that he had been illegally locked up for two years, or what effect it must have had on him or the apparent conflict between his position and that of the lawyer.\n\n\u201cHe appeared overly willing to accept the guilty plea, and to impose two 24 years sentences, only relenting by allowing them to be served consecutively.\u201d\n\nAccording to the humanists, Bala is being targeted because he renounced Islam, and for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of conscience or belief.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Nigerian authorities to ensure that the sentence is overturned and that blasphemy laws are repealed,\u201d the statement added.",

I have never attended to him. I work as a full-time nurse at Dowen College but I am a day nurse,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI work from 8.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m. from Monday to Friday.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago. The 3 banks, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA) were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nStandard Bank Group Ltd was fined \u20a6200 million (~$481,000) for 2 accounts alleged to have been used for crypto transactions. Access Bank was fined \u20a6500 million (~$1.2 million) for failure to close customers\u2019 crypto accounts, according to a filing with the Nigerian Exchange Ltd; and United Bank for Africa (UBA) was fined \u20a6100 million (~$240,000) for digital currency transactions by a customer.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto restriction\n\nIn February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all commercial banks and financial institutions to close all customer accounts that operate in or trade cryptocurrency. The apex bank referred to a 2017 circular that ordered commercial banks \u201cnot to use, hold, trade and/or transact in cryptocurrencies \u201c.\n\nLike most countries like China that have restricted crypto trading, CBN cited financial safety as the reason for the ban. In its circular clarifying its position, Osita Nwanisobi AG Director, Corporate Communications of CBN stated that most crypto users value anonymity, obscurement and concealment. \u201cIt is on the basis of this opacity that cryptocurrencies have become well-suited for conducting many illegal activities including money laundering, terrorism financing, purchase of small arms and light weapons, and tax evasion,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the CBN didn\u2019t ban cryptocurrencies in Nigeria as it\u2019d have to outlaw crypto exchanges and shut down the internet to achieve that. It did, however, cut the link between crypto exchanges and their users. So Nigerians can still buy and trade crypto, just not through any Nigerian bank or fintech.\n\nIn response to the restriction Nigerian crypto exchange platforms have responded with new ways to circumvent the restriction including introducing peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges for their cryptocurrency transactions, as well as trading stablecoins.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

L-R. Caroline van der Merwe and Simon Ellis\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech sector has attracted the most funding in the last three years, receiving $2.3 billion in 2021 alone. Some sectors get less than $50 million, cementing fintech\u2019s dominance.\n\nThis year seems to have seen increased attention on startups focused on digitising human resources and payroll functions for African businesses. Companies like Khazna, which provides salary-on-demand for employees, Earnipay, and SeamlessHR have all received investments this year.\n\nYesterday, another startup, SmartWage, announced its $2 million seed funding. The company received investment from Idris Bello, founding partner of LoftyInc Capital, Creator Collective Capital, Penrose Capital, and angel investors from Naspers, Dimension Data, Investec, and Standard Bank.\n\nWhat does SmartWage do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup enables employers to manage HR functions for employees who do not have an email via WhatsApp. This includes communication, leave requests, accessing payslips, and other products the company offers.\n\nIts solution is primarily focused on frontline employees like security personnel, restaurant staff, and cashiers who often do not have an email. Since it was founded in 2020, SmartWage has added clients like Debonairs, Seattle Coffee, Truda, Twizza, KFC, and Edgars.\n\nIn a statement on the investment, Bello shared his optimism that the startup could drive digital inclusion in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe team at SmartWage are innovators \u2013 they\u2019re building more than just an earned wage access product, and have recognised that in order to make a tangible impact on employers, they need to build a powerful way for employers to engage with their workforce.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Simon, Caroline and the powerful team they\u2019ve assembled to support SmartWage\u2019s mission to drive digital inclusion across Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nZirooPay\u2019s Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional PoS Terminal\n\nThe popularity of PoS merchants in Nigeria has grown in the last five years as more individuals choose them over long ATM and bank queues. Before this, a customer who intended to withdraw or make deposits had to wait for some time before completing transactions.\n\nThe financial institutions powering these merchants (banks and fintechs) have also seen tremendous growth. One of these fintech startups \u2013 ZirooPay \u2013 has announced the completion of its $11.4 million Series A round.\n\nThe round had a combination of institutional and individual investors, such as Zrosk Investment Management, Inventure, Fedha Capital, Exotix Advisory, Petri Kivinen, Abiodun Ajai, Kurt Bjorklund, Stephane Kurgan, and Jonas Dromberg.\n\nThe startup plans to use these new funds to expand its payment infrastructure, accelerate growth, and grow its team.\n\nThe company\u2019s value proposition is to improve the transaction success rate of merchants on its platform. It does this using an application that can work in areas with little or no Internet coverage.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nWhile PoS services target areas with low bank penetration, the PoS machines are powered by the Internet. Consequently, they often experience downtimes as a result of poor Internet connections. However, with ZirooPay\u2019s solution, the company claims it can ensure transaction success rates of 95% compared to 50% from competing services.\n\nDevCareer\u2019s $100k grant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nDevCareer has received a $100,000 grant for the third cohort of its Laptops4Developers program. The non-profit revealed that it plans to train 100 people in this cohort which will run in five African countries \u2013 Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Zambia, and Rwanda.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem grows, the demand for African tech talents has grown simultaneously. This demand has been partly driven by remote work and some African countries having English as an official language.\n\nSeveral businesses have sprung up to fill this demand for talent with the likes of Gebeya, Andela, and TalentQL (where DevCareer\u2019s founder, Sultan Akintunde is a co-founder). However, DevCareer is different from the others as it is a non-profit organization.\n\nAkintunde started DevCareer with another software engineer, Chidi Okoye, in 2019. Before that, he had tried to raise funds for people looking to get into tech. A conversation with a sponsor led to the start of DevCareer to provide a pathway to help upcoming African developers.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nCan Nigeria tax its remote workers?\n\nHow I Grew to 1M YouTube Subscribers in Medical School \u2013 Kharma Medic\n\nRide-Hailing: Is It Sustainable?\n\nOpportunities\n\nBitmama has several roles open.

          "text": "Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue State has dismissed media reports that the PDP zoning committee has jettisoned zoning and thrown open the race for its presidential ticket.\n\nThe governor in who heads the PDP committee, according to a statement issued Wednesday in Makurdi by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, wondered why those who were not part of the meeting of the committee would want to \u201cforce words into the committee\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo I want to clear the insinuation that the zoning committee has thrown open the presidential ticket. I did inform the media yesterday that the committee had adopted a unanimous position to be presented to the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\n\u201cWhere did I say that the committee has thrown open the presidential ticket? The committee will present the report to NEC. It is NEC that has the final authority on the zoning of positions.\n\n\u201cAs far as the committee was concerned, there were arguments that the presidential ticket should go to the South. Some said it should go to the Northern part of the country. There were others who were of the opinion that it should be thrown open to allow the best candidate who will be able to deliver good governance and make Nigerians feel like human beings again, contest.\n\n\u201cAs the chairman of the committee, I did not say it has been thrown up. So it is very wrong for anyone to insinuate that we have thrown the presidential ticket open. I am still repeating that, whatever we did, we have submitted our report to NEC. So it is wrong for the media to come out with a position despite the fact that they were not members of the committee.\n\n\u201cSo it is wrong completely. I did not say that. And like I said, NEC is the final authority on deciding where the position will be zoned to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the party leadership is consciously working towards ensuring that the party gets it right this time. I believe that at the end, the right thing will be done. Preempting the committee\u2019s work and NEC decision is not correct. I want to appeal that NEC will soon invite us to a meeting and then we can move on from there.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the most important thing to the PDP is what the party can do to bring the economy and security situation back to normalcy, because If something drastic is not done about the present situation in the country, a time will come when even the Presidential Villa and other government houses will be taken over by the terrorists. They are already closing in on us and we seem to be helpless. Everyone must team up to fight for justice, equity and fairness,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue State has dismissed media reports that the PDP zoning committee has jettisoned zoning and thrown open the race for its presidential ticket.\nI did inform the media yesterday that the committee had adopted a unanimous position to be presented to the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\u201cWhere did I say that the committee has thrown open the presidential ticket?\n\u201cAs far as the committee was concerned, there were arguments that the presidential ticket should go to the South.\nSo it is very wrong for anyone to insinuate that we have thrown the presidential ticket open.",

          "text": "To enhanced safe practices around Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) among students in North-East schools, Jose Foundation UK, an independent child-centred not-for-profit organisation has commenced sensitisation campaign targeting secondary schools in Borno and Yobe States.\n\nJose Foundation UK in a statement on Wednesday signed by its president, Dr Martins Abhulimhen, said the foundation was committed to eradicating extreme poverty, advancing children\u2019s rights, and ensuring girl child equality across the globe.\n\nThe statement noted that the foundation is currently implementing a global sensitisation aimed at creating awareness and ensuring safe\n\npractices around Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in a bid to address the global pandemic arising from COVID-19.\n\nIn Borno State, the organisation held the sensitisation programme at Muhammadu Buhari Academy, a mega boarding school in Maiduguri\n\nMetropolitan Council (MMC) where students were sensitised on the symptoms of COVID-19 and the prevention measures to observe within and outside their learning environment.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe first phase of the global sensitisation campaign targets public schools to ensure children are aware of, and\n\nequipped with the basic knowledge to protect themselves from the coronavirus and also carry-out the basic WASH practices to stay safe.\n\n\u201cThe organisation observed that during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, government enforced closure of schools in an attempt to reduce the spread of the disease.\n\n\u201cSchools in fragile contexts remain at particular risk of not re-opening, or re-opening with inadequate sanitation facilities and psychosocial support for students. Studies have also shown that girls are less likely to return to school after a period of absence, especially girls in conflict affected regions.\n\n\u201cEven though the wave of the pandemic has reduced, and government have relaxed the restrictions, an assessment conducted by Jose Foundation\n\nUK programme team in the Northeast shows poor or non-adherence to basic COVID-19 prevention measures especially within public schools.\n\n\u201cIt is on this premise that the Foundation has not relented in its efforts to ensure that children, especially girls in Northeast Nigeria are supported with the necessary COVID-19 awareness and prevention and basic Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sensitization to ensure that they stay safe and protected within their learning environment.\u201d\n\nThe foundation further stated that the sensitisation campaign seeks to address the poor prevention practices observed across some Government\n\nschools in conflict affected North-eastern States of Borno and Yobe as regards to COVID-19 prevention and general Water, Sanitation and Hygiene practices.\n\nRecall that the organisation had earlier conducted the COVID-19 sensitisation in Government Girls Secondary School, Damaturu, Yobe\n\nState.\n\nThe students were sensitised on the symptoms of COVID-19 and the prevention measures to observe within and outside their learning\n\nenvironment. The facilitator also trained the school girls on handwashing and safe use of latrines in their schools to prevent transmission of infections.\n\nJose Foundation UK team led by Ms Joy Otuonye donated facemasks, washing soaps, disinfectants and other PPEs to the school girls as\n\nwell as to the school management.\n\nThe foundation hoped that through this sensitisation and distribution of these items to students and the school, the students and their\n\nteachers will be able to improve on their personal protection and hygiene.\n\nIn appreciation of the support to the school, headmistress, Muhammadu Buhari Academy, Maiduguri, Hajia Amina Mustapha Haruna, appreciated\n\nthe leadership of Jose Foundation UK for selecting the school for the campaign.\n\nShe noted that the sensitisation was lifesaving and critical for the safety of the children and also noted that the items will also be used\n\nto strengthen the WASH practices in the school.\n\nJose Foundation UK said it will continue to prioritise the campaign as well as support school systems especially in conflict affected\n\nNortheast with WASH facilities to further improve access to safe and hygienic facilities.",

Only individuals and groups who believe in his competence have been putting pressure on him to run.\n\n\u201cWe, members of the CSOs Coordinating Centre, also expressed our confidence in Dr Emefiele\u2019s leadership of the apex bank and positive achievements being recorded under his watch.\n\n\u201cThe general public, especially those concerned, should note that we are aware that some CSOs have been heavily mobilised to the tune of $1m to embark on smear camapign funded by the desperate politicians against Emefiele.\n\n\u201cMore specifically, we note the likes of the Convener, Adopt A Goal Initiative, Dare Ariyo-Atoye; Coordinator, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, Emmanuel Onwubiko; the National Coordinator, Advocate for People\u2019s Rights and Justice, Giwa Victor, and others who have been granting interviews against the CBN gov.\n\n\u201cWe hereby declare them hatchet men paid to smear Emefiele and expel them from activities of the CSOs Coordinating Center which is a apex platform for all CSOs involved in public advocacy and ban them from attending any event that the CCC is part of for one year until they apologise for the smear attacks.\n\n\u201cWe hope they will retrace their steps and allow commonsense to prevail.\u201d",

          "text": "Eleven months after, the federal government Wednesday lifted the nationwide midnight curfew earlier imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, restrictions on parties, concerts, other large gatherings and related activities were also lifted.\n\nPresidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 announced this in a statement in Abuja.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cImplementation Guidelines for Easing COVID-19 Restrictions.\u201d\n\nThe nationwide ban on social gathering and imposition of curfew were announced May 10, 2022.\n\nUnder the arrangement, a nationwide curfew was, among other measures, imposed from 12.00am- 4.00am to arrest further spread of the virus.\n\nDecisions revised\n\nAnnouncing the lifting of the ban, the PSC said the social restriction recommendations were revised in line with the three established thematic areas of movement, industry and labour, as well as community activities.\n\nThe PSC also said the decision followed the reduced risk of importation of new variants, availability of vaccines and the increasing number of people vaccinated in Nigeria and globally.\n\nA Tuesday update provided by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), showed 3,142 persons had so far been killed by the virus, while 255, 516 infections were recorded.\n\nThe new order\n\nIn the new guidelines, the government urged everyone to comply with existing safety protocols such as the use of face masks, regular hand washing and social distancing to limit spread of the virus.\n\nThe PSC said: \u201cPatients with underlying ailments are advised to uphold the use of universal precaution which includes the use of face masks, avoid crowds, and frequent use of hand sanitizers.\u201d\n\nThe government also said the safety protocols provided a baseline from which state governments could further build to strengthen their responses based on their local circumstances.\n\nIn the new guidelines, the states were advised to \u201ccontinue to consider them as the minimum guidelines required to ensure an acceptable level of epidemic control nationwide.\u201d\n\nThe fresh guidelines also allowed unlimited air travels \u2013 both domestic and international flights.\n\nThe government urged both international and domestic travellers to abide by all existing protocols, including the use of face masks while onboard and taking personal precaution measures; and all arriving international passengers must register on the Nigeria International Travel Portal.\n\nIt said: \u201cNo limitations on inter or intra-state travel; all vendors and service providers must abide by stated stipulations from the Federal Ministry of Transportation; all passengers and commuters must wear face masks once on board, as well as continue to observe personal precautionary measures.\u201d\n\nRising infectious diseases\n\nMeanwhile, following the emergence and rapid spread of coronavirus, yellow fever, Ebola, and Lassa fever among other infectious diseases, medical experts have advocated improved adult vaccination campaigns in Nigeria.\n\nThis is as they scored childhood vaccination efforts fair, calling on relevant authorities to invest more in vaccinations as tested means of mitigating what they described as the dangerous impacts of infectious diseases globally.\n\nThese experts, including a professor and consultant physician at the Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM) Ikeja, Olufunke Adeyeye, and the chief consultant and head of geriatrics unit at the National Hospital, Abuja, Ogugua Osi-Ogbu, among others, gave the advice at an adult vaccination media roundtable which was recently organised by an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation and vaccine makers, Pfizer Incorporation.\n\nThey said substantial improvements in adult vaccination are needed to reduce the health consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nImportance of vaccines\n\nRelevant statistics have shown that childhood vaccines save an estimated between two and three million lives worldwide every year. However, some 20 million children are estimated to miss out on life-saving vaccines annually, and that these children are mostly found in Africa.\n\nTherefore, child inoculation is perceived to be a top priority as vaccines are found to be the most cost-effective approach for reducing childhood disease burden.\n\nBut while adults have less chance of getting infection, the emergence and rapid spread of such infectious diseases such as Lassa fever, COVID-19, among others, have shown that the adult population now has increased risks of getting communicable diseases owing to urbanisation, globalisation, and increasing international travel.\n\nThe experts, who emphasised the importance of adult vaccination as well as the challenges and gaps identified in it, noted that adults have a decreased immunological response when they are exposed to infections.\n\nExperts speak\n\nSpeaking at the virtual media roundtable, Mrs Adeyeye said: \u201cA systematic review of infections in individuals older than 65 years found that coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were all associated with a significantly higher risk of acquiring pneumococcal infections.\u201d\n\nShe added that immunisation in Nigeria, so far, has been primarily directed towards infants and children, but that \u201cvaccination is as important for adults as it is for children\u201d.\n\nOn her part, Mrs Osi-Ogbu, said: \u201cPneumococcal disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Many high-income countries recommend pneumococcal vaccination in older adults but, even where policies are in place, coverage is often low. Very few low and/or mid-income countries currently provide pneumococcal vaccination to older adults as a part of a routine programme.\u201d\n\nThe experts described vaccine preventable diseases as infectious diseases caused by viruses or bacteria that can be prevented with vaccines.\n\n\u201cVaccines are not just for kids; adults need vaccines too. Even if fully vaccinated as a child, adults may be at risk for other diseases due to age, job, lifestyle, travel, or a health condition.\n\n\u201cVaccines don\u2019t just protect you; they protect those around you, too. Vaccines protect individuals against specific diseases, but they also help those who have not had the vaccine by creating \u201cherd immunity\u201d. This protects people vulnerable to the disease, such as babies too young to be vaccinated, people undergoing chemotherapy, the elderly, and people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons,\u201d added the chief consultant.\n\nImmunisation access key \u2013 Pfizer Director\n\nIn a related development, the medical director for sub-Saharan Africa of Pfizer Incorporation, Kodjo Soroh, has said the company has a long history in vaccine research and development.\n\nHe said through the development of innovative delivery systems and technologies, Pfizer had created scalable solutions that address prevention of deadly bacterial infections.\n\n\u201cThe key to maintaining and building on these advances is constant vigilance and continued access to immunisations is essential to preserving the progress we\u2019ve made against vaccine-preventable conditions and strengthening our ability to address emerging health threats,\u201d Soroh said.\n\nHe added that the company applies science and her global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.\n\n\u201cWe strive to set the standard for quality, safety, and value in the discovery, development, and manufacture of health care products, including innovative medicines and vaccines. Every day, Pfizer colleagues work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments, and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time,\u201d he added.

I commend this National Policy for the consideration of the State and Local Governments and indeed the Private Sector.\n\nMaintenance of Assets is more than a culture, it is an economy from which many can prosper and we must nurture and water that economy by policy and actions that create opportunities and inclusion for our people.\n\nWhile it is true that our economy has been diversified and the non-oil sector is leading in terms of contribution to the Gross Domestic Product, the maintenance and facility management component of the services sector is an opportunity that is waiting to be maximized.\n\nIt is my hope that this Order will open the door to this treasure of opportunities for young Technicians, for Artisans, for Vendors and Suppliers and for Small Businesses and Cottage Industries.\n\nThank you and God Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "The United States on Wednesday announced it would impose a new slate of sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, and that for the first time, sanctions would target the two adult daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nKaterina Tikhonova and Mariya Putina, who are in their 30s, are rarely seen in public and almost never mentioned by their father. The Kremlin has only ever identified them by their first names.\n\n\u201cWe believe that many of Putin\u2019s assets are hidden with family members, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re targeting them,\u201d said a senior administration official who spoke on background to preview the new measures.\n\nIn 2015, Putin acknowledged that his daughters lived in Russia and were fluent in multiple languages, but said, \u201cTo talk about where exactly my daughters work and what they do\u2014I have never done this and am not going to do it now, for many reasons, including security issues.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Putin\u2019s daughters, the U.S. will sanction Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov\u2019s wife and daughter, as well as Former President and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the White House announced.\n\nU.S. officials said this latest round of sanctions was in direct response to shocking new evidence of what are likely to be war crimes committed by Russian troops in the Ukrainian town of Bucha.\n\nThere, civilians were found shot to death with their hands tied behind their backs following Russia\u2019s weekslong occupation of the village.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing less happening than major war crimes,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a speech Wednesday in Washington.\n\n\u201cResponsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with our allies and our partners, we\u2019re gonna keep raising the economic cost and ratchet up the pain for Putin.\u201d\n\nBeyond individual designations, Biden said he will sign a new executive order prohibiting any new investment in Russia by Americans, which will apply to both U.S. residents and those living abroad.\n\nTwo of Russia\u2019s largest banks, Sberbank and Alfa Bank, will be subjected to full blocking sanctions for the first time, albeit with carveouts for energy purchases.\n\nSeveral major Russian state enterprises are also being placed under full blocking sanctions, the White House said, with specific entities to be announced later this week by the Treasury Department.\n\nThe new sanctions are being coordinated with members of the G-7 group of developed economies and the European Union, part of an effort to maximize their impact and minimize opportunities for the Kremlin to evade them.\n\nOne of the most highly visible examples of this coordination has been the seizure of several mega yachts belonging to sanctioned Russian billionaires at luxurious vacation ports across Europe.\n\nThe most recent high-profile collaboration took place Monday in the Spanish resort town of Palma de Mallorca, when law enforcement officials from the U.S. and Spain jointly seized a $90 million mega yacht belonging to sanctioned Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg.\n\nBiden highlighted the international yacht seizure program in his speech Wednesday to leaders of several building trade unions.\n\n\u201cDid you see these yachts that are being picked up?\u201d he asked the crowd, incredulous. \u201cThink about the incredible amounts of money these oligarchs have stolen.\u201d\n\nKremlin connected oligarchs will \u201cnot be allowed to keep these yachts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, these luxury vacation homes while children in Ukraine are being killed,\u201d said Biden.",

          "title": "Russia-Ukraine War: Poland Accommodates Over Two Million Refugees, Including 2,000 Nigerians",
          "text": "The government of Poland has said over two million refugees from Ukraine including over two thousand Nigerians fleeing the Russia-Ukraine War have been allowed passage into Poland.\n\nA statement on Wednesday by the Embassy of Poland in Nigeria titled: \u201cPoland stands with Ukraine \u2013 the spirit of Polish solidarity reborn,\u201d read: \u201cThis February Europe witnessed an unprecedented and unprovoked military attack by the Russian Federation on Ukraine. In the wake of the unjustified invasion, Poland, who is Ukraine\u2019s next door neighbor, immediately extended a helping hand to a friendly nation in need.\n\n\u201cSince February 24, Poland opened its borders to over two million people fleeing Ukraine from the Russian aggression. Although most refugees are obviously Ukrainian, there are also thousands of third country nationals who found shelter in Poland. Polish authorities let in everyone irrespective of nationality, race or creed. Many of those who crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border were African nationals, including more than two thousand Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that: \u201cThe government of Poland went to great lengths and undertook every effort to ensure all refugees received meaningful, effective and comprehensive assistance. Meals were distributed at border crossings, transport was provided to receptive points where further assistance and help were provided by local government authorities. Moreover, country legislation was amended to cater for the needs of refugees and facilitate the provision of assistance.\n\n\u201cAll refugees are guaranteed free of charge medical care. Poland accepts and helps terminally ill refugees, the physically challenged and orphans. Ukrainian children are given the opportunity to resume learning in Polish primary and secondary schools. All Ukrainian citizens can apply for a Polish national identity number which entitles the holder to benefit from social welfare and medical care and many other privileges on a par with Polish citizens.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cPoles open their hearts and homes to refugees.\n\nInterestingly enough, it is not only the Polish government that has provided immense assistance, but also ordinary Polish citizens contributed in a tremendous bottom-up response. Individuals, families, neighborhoods and local communities started helping on their own. They brought food, provided transport from the border to every corner of the country, set up information platforms linking up those in need with potential providers of accommodation, clothes, medicine, food etc.\n\n\u201cAccommodation places were created by the government and local governments, but a large number of refugees is hosted in Poles\u2019 private houses. As more and more people arrive the numbers of those willing to help are not decreasing. On the contrary, the assistance given by regular Polish citizens is becoming more effective and structured, sensitive to the changing needs of the refugees. It is worth mentioning that Polish citizens created special assistance platforms dedicated exclusively to assisting African nationals, a large percentage of whom are Nigerians. The support offered includes, for instance, finding accommodation, translation services and free of charge legal assistance for those wishing to remain in Poland.\u201d\n\nThe statement further revealed that the Polish government has launched a robust and comprehensive system for provision of humanitarian assistance not only in Poland but also in Ukraine, noting that: \u201cHumanitarian convoys leave Poland for Ukraine on a daily basis transporting medicine, food, clothing and other necessities financed by the Polish government, NGOs and individuals.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that: \u201cPoland has contributed 500 000 CHF for humanitarian actions conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross. All assistance sent to Ukraine is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland and the Office of the Prime Minister.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said: \u201cThe Polish government remains in contact with Ukrainian partners in order to provide the most effective and needed assistance.\n\nIn solidarity with other nations.\u201d\n\nIn a bilateral level, the statement said Poland has maintained friendly diplomatic relations with Nigeria for the past 60 years, with hundreds of Nigerians choosing to study in Poland each year on a commercial basis, as well as on scholarships sponsored by the Polish government.",
