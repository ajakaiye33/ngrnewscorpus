          "text": "One person was feared killed at Itaji Ekiti in the Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State on Saturday following the clash between supporters of the governing All Progressives Congress and the opposition Social Democratic Party in the state.\n\nWhile the APC blamed the SDP for attacking its members passing through the community, the opposition party claimed they were attacked by supporters of the ruling party.\n\nAlthough sources could not confirm whether there was death or not, they said hell was let loose in the community while the incident lasted.\n\nThe Director of Media, Biodun Oyebanji Campaign Organisation of the APC, Taiwo Olatunbsun, condemned the alleged violent attack on APC members in Itaji-Ekiti on Saturday, which he said \u201cresulted in the killing of one APC member and many others sustaining severe injuries\u201d.\n\nOlatubosun said, \u201cSome APC members are at present hospitalised where medical personnel are battling to save their lives following life-threatening injuries they received in the attack carried out by SDP thugs.\n\n\u201cThe Oyebanji Campaign warns Oni and his supporters against further attacks on APC members. The warning to SDP and its candidate became imperative against the background of similar murderous conduct in the past when Oni allegedly deployed thugs to attack opposition members in his alleged desperate bid to win governorship rerun poll in 2009.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe APC campaign procession in Ekiti North Senatorial District was peaceful earlier in the day until it was disrupted by SDP thugs. It was also reported that the attack on the deceased was carried out by violent thugs who arrived in one Toyota Hilux and Tacoma vehicles.\u201d\n\nBut the Director of Media, Segun Oni Campaign Organisation, Jackson Adebayo, who said APC supporters launched an unprovoked attack on SDP members, said, \u201cWe (the SDP) were at the palace at Itaji Ekiti where Segun Oni was meeting with obas in the local government area.\u201d\n\nAdebayo said, \u201cSome people were outside the palace; suddenly, we saw about five buses loaded with transporters being used as political thugs by the APC. They started shooting sporadically. We initially thought they were shooting to scare us, people were running helter-skelter.\n\n\u201cThey were also trying to force their way to where Segun Oni was, maybe in an attempt to assassinate him. That was when they were repelled by security agencies, who coincidentally were passing by. They escaped; unfortunately, one of the thugs missed their vehicle because he fell down. We interrogated him and he said they were agents of the APC.\n\n\u201cThey were the ones that attacked us; nobody beat the one that missed their vehicle. He was already injured from the fall. It was later that people said one of them died,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Sunday Abutu, said, \u201cThere was a clash earlier around Itaji Ekiti between members of two parties and investigation to unravel what transpired and the number of casualties, as well as the possible arrest of culprits, has commenced.\n\nAbutu, who said normalcy had since been restored to the area, promised to give an update as soon as further information was available.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Adebayo had in a \u201cpress statement\u201d, decried alleged incessant attacks on SDP members in different parts of the state by hoodlums believed to be APC supporters.\n\nThe SOCO spokesperson, who said members of the party were being attacked at will and the attendant destruction of property, said even the convoy of the party\u2019s governorship candidate, Chief Oni, and the vehicle of his running mate, Ladi Owolabi, were not spared.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Democracy Day: ActionAid makes case for Nigerian women, youths, PWDs",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nAs Nigeria mark 23 years of uninterrupted democracy, a human rights non-governmental organization, ActionAid Nigeria, AAN, has said that for Nigeria to uphold the pillars and ethos of it consolidating democracy, all groups such as women, youths and Persons With Disabilities, PWDs must be actively involved in the democratic and governance processes in the country.\n\nActionAid Nigeria\u2019s Programmes Director, Suwaiba Muhammad Dankabo, made this known during a rally organized by the group in collaboration with Centre for Communication and Social Impact (CCSI) and Centre for Information, Technology and Development (CITAD) to commemorate Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day in Kano.\n\nDankabo further said that over the years, Nigeria\u2019s democracy has been largely characterised by the exclusion of women, young people and PWDs, in the processes hence the need to change the trend.\n\nShe went ahead to say that the cycle of persons were yet to attain the level of inclusion in politics due to poor internal democracy and absence of strategic political agenda on the part of the political parties in the country.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cOver the years, Nigeria\u2019s democracy has been largely characterised by the exclusion of women, young people and PWDs, in the democratic and governance processes due to barriers and inequalities militating against their participation, which has inadvertently led to the shrinkage of the political space for them to engage in the politics and governance.\n\n\u201cIn the same line, it is imperative to note that Nigerian youths and women are yet to achieve the level of inclusion required to gain representation in politics due to leadership deficits, poor internal democracy among the older parties, and the absence of strategic political agenda which poses barriers, that inhibit them from playing a role in national development.\n\n\u201cThe participation of Women continue to dwindle in each electoral cycle, despite the fact that women constitute the highest numbers at polling units.\n\n\u201cHowever, women constitute only 5.4% in National Assembly, 4.6% in State House of Assembly, and 16% in Federal Executive Council . This episode is clearly evidenced in the Kano States house of assembly which has no female representation in all the 40 seats in the assembly.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the youths who make up over 50% of the Nigerian population have also been side-lined from the political process, they are rather used as agents to perpetuate violence during elections, as patronage-based politics and the weaponization of poverty and illiteracy prevails in our dear nation.\n\n\u201cAt this critical juncture it is imperative for us to highlight, that\u2019 which makes our democratic life and expectation significant, because it Is impossible to celebrate a day which marks our democracy without the presence of free and fair elections, which reflects the aspirations of Nigerians, who are eligible to participate in elections by virtue of voting and being voted for, regardless of their age, gender, tribe, and religion. To attain a truly representative democracy in Nigeria, all groups within the population must be actively involved in the governance process in order to uphold the pillars and ethos of our consolidating democracy.\n\n\u201cActionAid Nigeria is implementing the Campaign for Inclusion of Women and Young People in Political and Governance Processes also referred to as the We-You Project with funding from the Foreign Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO). This campaign seeks to strengthen the relationship between citizens, government, and politicians in Nigeria, with an overarching goal to engender an inclusive and responsive democratic process and outcomes through citizens-led actions in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cOn this occasion to mark the 2022 Democracy Day, we urge all patriotic Nigerians including women and young people to join us, in breaking the barriers limiting women and young people from participating in governance and politics in Nigeria. We enjoin all Nigerians to make use of this opportunity provided by INEC, through the Continuous Voter Registration to register, and make their participation count in the forthcoming election, especially as all eyes are on INEC due to the passage of the electoral amendment bill into law and the use of Bi-modal voters accreditation system (BVAS) which is aimed at limiting electoral violence and malpractices.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we urge all political parties to create spaces for women and youths to play active roles within the party to ensure the implementation of the 35% affirmative action.\n\n\u201cOn this day, let history have it that Nigerian women and youths have refused to stay quiet in the face of exclusion and rights denial. Let it be known that we salute the courage of women and youth groups present here today who have swung into action to demand for their rights to vote and be voted for, and we call on those yet to join us to add their voices. We hereby encourage the women and youths to work and walk in solidarity, to keep the flag flying. We are strengthened by the knowledge that this struggle for inclusion is for posterity and for children yet unborn,\u201d the Programme Director, Dankabo however stated.",

          "title": "Professionals in government: Issues in navigating policy space in Nigeria",
          "text": "All across the world, the policy space has always been a critical and contested one. It is critical to the extent that it is within this space that government consolidate the social contract with the citizens through sound programmes that inform the development of the state and the well-being of the citizens. It is contested because it is a space where government no longer has the sole prerogative of determining what should constitute the specifics of governance dynamics. The policy space is traditionally reserved for bureaucrats and bureaucratic expertise. It is the public servants whose original task it is to assist the government in policy design and implementation. By the turn of the twentieth century, especially when the second World War happened, with all its attendant administrative, political and social consequences, this reality started to change.\n\nWith the emergence of the United Nations after the war, the foreign policy relationships and dynamics amongst nations became all the more significant. The UN became a structural standpoint to prevent further war. And thus, this led to the need for multilateral cum bilateral agreements and global partnerships that will facilitate the cordial relationship and collaborations between NGOs and development partners with states across the world. This brings these global partners into the policy management architecture of the states. It is however the United States\u2019 policy management experience during and after the war that signalled the widening of the policy space beyond the remit of traditional policy imperatives. America facilitated the inclusion of scholars and intellectuals, as well as the introduction of think tanks, into the policy space. This is further accentuated by the US spoils system. This practice within the context of the US presidential system is a double-edged sword. It has the potentials to both muddle the policy management space as well as strengthen it. It began as a means of allocating juicy appointments and positions to loyal party members when a president gets to power. And it eventually led to gross inefficiency until the Pendleton Federal Civil Service Act of 1883 put a stop to it. However, it still provides a solid administrative frame for injecting fresh technocratic and expert presence into the policy space.\n\nEven though it is customary, all through public administration history, to enlist scarce skills and core expertise to bridge knowledge, information and competency gaps at different stages of the policy process, there has always been a charged relationship between the bureaucrats as the gatekeepers of the space and the technocrats and experts that are meant to complement their policy efforts. The relationship between the public servants and bureaucrats on the one hand, and the technocratic team (technical advisers, policy experts, consultants and subject specialists) on the other has been governed by the tension between two fundamental issues. On one hand, there is the need to keep all policy processes and actions within the purview of technical rationalism. This is what activates the totality of administrative governing framework, from the famous General Order (GO) to the public service rules, circulars and other legal and administrative procedures, guidelines and instruments by which the policy management processes are streamlined. However, there is also the pervasive pressure to subject bureaucrats to a general accountability control in accordance with the imperatives and demands of democratic principles and governance.\n\nBut the bureaucracy is just what it is\u2014a turf that is guided with all sense of propriety and aggression. It is a space where the task of policy management is jealously guided from intrusion by perceived outsiders. This raises a genuine dilemma: the policy space can no longer be policed solely by the bureaucrats whose policy actions must be complemented by non-bureaucrats. And yet the bureaucratic policy space is professionally unique and cannot be arrogantly transgressed by those who think they have better expertise. This makes the policy space a very charged one. Like the larger governance space, the task of governance can no longer be left to the expertise of the bureaucrats and government officials alone. The demands of democratic governance insist that nonstate and non-governmental actors be drawn in to contribute their own perception, thoughts and expertise to the task of governing the citizenry better than the government alone is ever going to manage.\n\nWhen managerialism made its appearance from the 1960s, the pressure to modernize policy and make it more efficient redoubled the urgent need for reforming the policy space and forcing the bureaucrats to comply. The managerial revolution was motivated by the need to transform the operational dynamics of the traditional administrative framework in line with modern technologies and administrative machineries, especially as determined by the private sector and its efficiency, capacities and competences. Managerialism asks for effectiveness, flexibility, leanness, efficiency, performance and productivity. And it compelled a lot of attention on the insularity of the public service in relation with the imperatives of the larger governance and policy space. With managerialism, the policy management space can no longer be the same. Thus, as dominant paradigm in public administration, and with its emphases on upending action and policy research, entrepreneurial culture, it contributed to the need for expanding the policy and governance space and deepening the relevance of technocratic experts and professionals from outside of the bureaucracy.\n\nWithin the Nigerian policy space, it is the managerial imperative of enlarging the space, coupled with the fundamental development predicament of the Nigerian state after colonialism, that facilitated the entry into policy management of such experts, scholars and technocrats like Pius Okigbo, Wolfgang Stolper, Ojetunji Aboyade, Taslim Elias, Adamu Baike, Ben Nwabueze, Jibril Aminu, Claude Ake, Kalu Idika Kalu, and many others who brought skills and competences into the policy processes. And yet, the governance and policy space in Nigeria demonstrates most tragically the charged nature of the relationship between the bureaucrats and the technocrats. Indeed, the diagnostic literature in Nigeria\u2019s administrative history regards the civil service as a significant part of the development challenge Nigeria is facing. Apart from its institutional reform issue and the need to inject critical meritocratic competence, the civil service has a reputation for being too closed up. Technocrats, professionals and experts over the years have lamented the challenge of working closely with bureaucrats on policy issues.\n\nOne critical nature of the Nigerian state and its governance dynamics has to do with the ease with which the system reward mediocrity. Even as the bureaucracy harbours significant high-end talents, often times, mediocre, rather than the brightest and the best, find themselves at the top of the administrative and technocratic ladders where they are served by the best the Nigerian nation can afford, from the university scholars and intellectuals to top-notch professionals. Unfortunately, this technocratic best that could serve the nation are forced to look up to their mediocre bosses, especially with regard to issues and policies that shape the direction and performance metrics of the structures and institutions they oversee. And who would want to blame those who had to keep their distance from the policy space when they cannot continue to bear the brunt of mediocrity in a nation with a huge demographics of core professionals and experts of global standing? How does a nation like Nigeria that wants to be a global economic player in twenty-first century account for countless first-class graduates languishing in the unemployment market? And the agony doubles because the university teachers who are tasked with the responsibility of forming the human capital Nigeria requires to become a developmental state have been effectively pauperized!\n\nOne of the greatest challenges that the experiment of democratic governance in Nigeria faces is that of managing cross-over professionals (COPs); a term I first picked up at Patrick Okigbo\u2019s Nextier seminar. COPs being those who, through a significant dose of patriotism and motivation, transition from private practices, diaspora, academia and civil society organisations to public service. This is even more fundamental a challenge because governments across the globe are caught in the managerial search for administrative and institutional reforms that will yield efficiency, flexibility and productivity. And the private sector provides a model for rethinking traditional bureaucracy a la managerialism. And this is all the more urgent within the context of the erosion of meritocracy and the breakdown of competency-based human resource management the Nigerian public service has witnessed. There is however a constant clash of perspective between the vision of independent expertise that stands at the heart of a depoliticized model of policymaking, and the imperative of bureaucratic control and democratic accountability that locates the Weberian policy context and its public service general order (or PSR).\n\nBut then, COPs transitioning into the public service in Nigeria are usually not prepared for the dynamics of what I have called bureau-pathology\u2014the sets of structural and institutional deficiencies\u2014that ambush their good intention of injecting new and scarce competencies into the public service. Thus, when bureaucrats protect their turfs, it is the administrative outsiders and their critical skills that are often on the receiving end of the bad deal, and the government pays the price in terms of productivity. Ultimately, the idea of COPs introduces the need to reflect on a model of bureaucrats-COP relationship that will facilitate the transformation of the public service for effective and efficient performance. And for my concern in this piece, such a model gives due credit to patriotic technocrats who are eager to cast their competences and skills into the task of nation-building and national development.\n\nThe other side of the equation is equally valid. Public administration is a profession with its own code of practice, attitudinal framework and value-system. The point there is that for any outsiders to make significant impact on the task of working together with the public servants in the policy and governance space, they must demonstrate some levels of understanding and empathy with the public service code of practice with full recognition that public administration is a profession in its own right. That learning curve becomes all the more rewarding if they demonstrate professional humility that enlists skilled bureaucrats in their technical team rather than creating private enclaves populated by outsiders as is the common practice. Coming into the public service is all by itself a daunting experience for any technocrat, without bringing along any professional arrogance that on its own has to engage with the turf war that the bureaucrats also have ready.\n\nQuite unfortunately, and despite the best reform intentions and efforts of successive Nigerian government and bureaucratic leadership, the Nigeria\u2019s administrative system still operates a one-size-fits-all codes of administrative operations usually activated by circulars and a whole range of governance codes which civil servants are experts in. This is so because many of the key reforms since 1974 have not gained ground or are far-between. Many of these standard operating systems are sadly not embedded by new and efficient management innovation, procedures and technologies at the rapidly growing frontiers of policy and project management techniques. They therefore tend to be annoyingly rigid, unimaginative and even stifling of any innovative possibilities. This procedural matter is further compounded by the civil service structure of authority, which embeds positions and persons in manners that could be dysfunctional especially where occupants of posts do not have the skills, knowledge and competence that performance and productivity require. This dynamic is aggravated by the weight that the civil service put on seniority and hierarchy at the expense of knowledge, competence, administrative discretion and team work. It is therefore no surprise that the entire system, outside of the best objectives of managerialism, is heavily oriented towards input and process at the expense of output and results.\n\nThus, within this context of dysfunctionality and professional/technocratic arrogance and ignorance, the stage is set for collaborative conflict founded on an adversarial model that preclude any form of agreement between the bureaucrats and the technocrats on the resolution of the problems of policy management. It is this conflict-ridden model, rather than the collaborative one that facilitate consensus and mutual respect, that had led to the humiliation of many well-meaning and patriotic cross-over professionals and technocrats who had made the bold move to serve the Nigerian state and make better and functional the policy and governance space for the betterment of Nigerians.\n\nI particularly cannot forget the sad experience of a full-bodied and world class scholar, Prof. Adenike Grange, the former minister of health, and her tragic story within the policy space. Like many significant others, she was embroiled, in the course of her national service, in issues that led to an unwarranted and most annoying persecution and resignation in ways that could have tarnished the reputation she has spent a significant part of her life accumulating. For daring to stick her neck out, she paid a huge price simply for offering herself selflessly to render patriotic service to her country. But this is what I suspect\u2014if these technocrats are invited again to national service, they just might overlook the wrongs done them. Patriotism seems to cover a multitude of sin.\n\nIf we are agreed that the enlarged space of policy management is required to transform democratic governance in Nigeria, then we need to explore the reform possibilities that will enable the bureaucrats and technocrats to work together and bring the full weight of their skills and competences to bear on the challenges of modernizing the space into a flexible, performing and productive enterprise. There is for instance a policy gap in the public service, MDAs without strategic plans; poor policy analysis due to non-professionalization of departments of planning, research and statistics; lack of action/policy research work that harnesses policy-research and global knowledge networks to strengthen strategic policy intelligence and for problem-solving as part of contingency planning; poor data culture; poor monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as well as project management capabilities.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need to modernize the policy architecture in ways that allow policymaking to facilitate the transformation of the lives of Nigerians. The changes involved in modernising the policy making process would include: (i) designing policies around outcomes; (ii) making sure policies are inclusive, fair and evidence-based; (iii) avoiding unnecessary burdens on businesses; (iv) involving others in policy-making; (v) becoming more forward and outward-looking; and (vi) learning from experience. And this transformation of the policy management space will require the joint effort of both the Nigerian government, the bureaucrats and bureaucratic leadership and the team of technocrats, policy advisers and professional experts that could be taken as significant stakeholders to the policy process.\n\nThe essence of the collaborative partnership is to be able to transform the policy space into a significant recipient of productivity, which emanate from an administrative reform of the civil service. What is required to make the civil service a world class source of fundamental policymaking effort that orient good governance are not far-fetched: instituting competency-based HR practices; installing performance management accountability culture; injection of deep policy implementation techniques and project management praxis; changes in wage and incentive structure that attracts and retains high-end scarce skills and core competences; enabling a talent management system that enables only the very best to get to administrative leadership positions to cure subsisting menace of inbreeding; and establishing the best practices in the SES to beef up services\u2019 IQ of the top administrative leadership cadre as the lead motivator of performance in the civil service system.",
          "summary": "It is however the United States\u2019 policy management experience during and after the war that signalled the widening of the policy space beyond the remit of traditional policy imperatives.\nAmerica facilitated the inclusion of scholars and intellectuals, as well as the introduction of think tanks, into the policy space.\nIt has the potentials to both muddle the policy management space as well as strengthen it.\nAnd yet the bureaucratic policy space is professionally unique and cannot be arrogantly transgressed by those who think they have better expertise.\nWith managerialism, the policy management space can no longer be the same.",

          "text": "The aphrosim \u2018the die is cast\u2019 is usually employed to describe the situation when an event has happened, or a decision taken, that cannot be changed except in very unusual circumstances as happened when a victorious governorship candidate died shortly before he was officially announced as such by the appropriate government agency.\n\nINEC time table for the conduct of the presidential primaries for the 2023 Presidential election has Thursday, 9 June, 2022 as deadline. Going forward, the parties now have to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates and upload them to the INEC Candidates\u2019 Nomination Portal from Friday 10 June to June 17, 2022. Although INEC has a September date for the publication of the final list of nominated candidates, this article will assume that no such changes shall be made and, if made, they wont substantially affect the pivot of the article.\n\nThe Presidential election, scheduled for 25 February, 2023 has, as the late Chief K. O Mbadiwe of blessed memory would have put it, real men of \u2018timber and calibre\u2019, as candidates. However, because the time for a third force in Nigerian politics is yet to come, I shall limit the candidates to be considered here to those of only 3 political parties even though Governor Peter Obi is guaranteed to make waves especially in the Southeast, if he ends up being the candidate of the Labour party in place of newcomer, Jude Nwafor.\n\nThe candidates are, therefore, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the PDP, Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the APC and, of course, only tangentially, NNPP\u2019s Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso who, like President Muhammadu Buhari of old, would do well only in the North. The first part of the 2- part article will examine these candidates looking particularly at what we remember about them when they were in public office.\n\nAlhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nAlhaji Atiku Abubakar was, between 1999 \u2013 2007, the Vice \u2013 President to the rambunctious President Olusegun Obasanjo but their honey moon practically ended when the Obasanjo government ordered him disqualified to contest the 2007 presidential election as the candidate of the Action Congress (AC); a decision which the courts declared \u201cunconstitutional, illegal, null and void, and of no effect, whatsoever\u201d.\n\nAlhaji Atiku Abubakar was a very vivacious and effective Vice President the way he handled the Economy which was under his portfolio. Unfortunately, this was where, by common consent, he was adjudged to have hurt the country the most.\n\nThat being such a weighty charge, I shall proceed to prove it.\n\nAtiku\u2019s handling of the Privatisation programme of the Obasanjo administration has been severally described as nothing short of \u201cThe criminal auctioning of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn an article by IS\u2019HAQ MODIBBO KAWU, captioned as above, and from which I shall be quoting in extensio, Kawu wrote, inter alia:\n\n\u201cWHATEVER might be the reasons for its decision, we must thank the Nigerian Senate for the investigation conducted last week, into the privatisation and commercialisation programme of the (Obasanjo) government\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet me state that as early as the 1980s, when the imperialist powers began to ram down the throats of the ruling classes of neo-colonial countries like Nigeria, the mantra of privatising national assets as the cure-all remedy for economic problems, I have been stoutly opposed to the programme. In 1986, I wrote a piece titled, \u201cImperialism\u2019s Privatisation Panacea\u201d, for THE HERALD newspaper in Ilorin, warning of the dire consequences for the development of national productive forces and the danger to national sovereignty, of the much-touted advantages of off-loading national assets to the international bourgeoisie and their local appendages\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs it turned out, from the Babangida/Falae Structural Adjustment Policies, SAP, of the mid-eighties, but especially in the freewheeling, neo-liberal banditry of the Obasanjo period, between 1999 and 2007, privatisation was literally turned to the holy grail of government policy in Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur ruling class is actually a group of glorified thieves, and privatisation became effusively embraced, because it allowed them to pretend that they were doing something more noble than theft, by privatising national assets, while spewing the ideological garbage that \u2018government has no business with business\u2019; \u2018only the private-sector can profitably run enterprises\u2019, and such utter tosh!\u201d. \u201cIn truth, what was being done was to uproot Nigeria as we knew it, especially from the 1970s, when import-substitution industrialisation at least created jobs, around Nigeria. The process of privatization which the Obasanjo years foisted on Nigeria, has led to the cheap sales of many strategic national assets; stripping of valuables from these assets; de-industrialisation and the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs; and the entrenchment in the economic and political space of Nigeria, of the worst specimens of humans without patriotism, but an obscene gluttony and greed for theft and more theft!\u201d.This has been my summary of the criminal process of privatization of Nigerian assets by the political regimes of SAP and neo-liberalism\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe revelations from last week\u2019s Senate hearings were truly scandalous. It was revealed that the Aluminium Smelting Company of Nigeria, ALSCON, which was set up with $3.2 billion, was sold to a Russian firm, Russal, for a paltry $130million. Similarly, Delta Steel which was set up in 2005, at a cost of $1.5billion, was sold to Global Infrastructure for just $30million. ALSCON had been given $120million for the dredging of the Imo River, but it was never carried out\u201d.\n\nWhat is worse is that as late as during his 2019 presidential election, Atiku was still promising to sell even NNPC, whenever it is, he assumes office as President.\n\nHear him: \u201cI shall privatise the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), if elected President on Saturday. The NNPC will be sold to Nigerians with money to buy it\u201d.\n\nSimply put, woe beside that Nigerian who is not rich.\n\nStill talking privatisation under Vice President Atiku Abubakar, however, the least said about NITEL/MTEL the better, and for purposes of space constraint, I shall suggest that the reader Googles the article by Kunle Bello, who had to voluntarily retire as MD/CEO of Nigeria Mobile Telecoms Limited (Mtel) after 27 years, over what he described as \u201cthe gargantuan and immeasurable destruction Messrs\u2019 Pentascope unleashed on NITEL/MTEL and former staffers\u201d.\n\nPart 2 of the article will have more to say on the veracity, or otherwise, of the charge that Atiku, as VP, hurt Nigeria more than he helped her and, may need to be doubly scrutinised for his suitability for the presidency of Nigeria.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu\n\n\u201cLagos State had begun the twenty-first century as a boomtown crippled by crime, traffic, blight, and corruption. A regional economic hub and burgeoning state of 13.4 million people, the megalopolis had a global reputation for government dysfunction. Two successively elected governors, Bola Tinubu and Babatunde Fashola, worked in tandem to set the state on a new course. Beginning in 1999, their administrations overhauled city governance, raised new revenues, improved security and sanitation, reduced traffic, expanded infrastructure and transportation, and attracted global investment. By following through on their promises to constituents and forging a new civic contract between Lagos and its taxpayers, Tinubu and Fashola laid the foundation of a functional, livable, and sustainable metropolis\u201d \u2013 Gabriel Kuris, in \u2018Remaking a Neglected Megacity: A Civic Transformation in Lagos State, 1999-2012\u2019.\n\nCoincidentally, as at the time all the nation pilfering were going on in Abuja and companies as far apart as Warri and Calabar were being signed off in sweet heart deals, Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was confronted with a post military Lagos where the least problem was the mountain high waste products dotting every part of the metropolis. He had no alternative to setting up a high powered transition committee of some brilliant individuals, with experience in diverse disciplines, as well as hands -on experience, to come and assist him in clearing the Augean stable that Lagos had become.\n\nHe then went ahead to reform the civil service, reduce corruption and improved state infrastructure. He reformed the waste management system and put an end to the financial mismanagement within the system. He improved incentives for civil servants, and the judiciary, and improved the quality and hygiene of the working environment. His payroll-system reforms removed thousands of ghost workers. He also brought in expatriates to improve the hospitals and transportation system. Here I just must tell a story he told Professor Bayo William\u2019s and I about how he got the funding to turn Lagos into the 5th biggest economy in Africa.\n\nIt goes thus: fearing Northern reaction after 13 per cent derivation was approved for oil producing states, President Obasanjo did not authorise payment of the funds. Sensing this, he said he approached Governor Segun Osoba to intercede with Northern governors many of who were his personal friends, and it worked like magic as Obasanjo then released the funds.\n\nThis was where the highly perspicacious Tinubu was going. According to him, he knew that his Southsouth colleagues could not immediately use those funds and that since banks would not like to sit on idle funds, if Lagos state, where they all had their headquarters, had bankable projects, they would not refuse to fund such projects.\n\nThat exactly was how states began to take bonds to fund their important projects.\n\nRabiu Musa Kwankwaso.\n\nA man very much after my heart except for his seeming political harlotry, running round political parties chasing presidential candidacy.\n\nBefore Alhaji Buba Galadima, the one time ally, and friend, of President Buhari became his enthusiastic spokesperson \u2013 he says he is not a member of NNPP \u2013 my dear aburo from our Ekiti roots \u2013 and political analyst extra-ordinaire, Tokunbo Omolase, has endeared the Kwankwasiyya leader to me for his extra- ordinary philanthropy, especially in education.\n\nI have, however, tried in vain, to understand why he failed to pay WAEC fees on behalf of the two Northern states which failed to enrol students for WAEC in 2022. He should need not be told that this is the greatest assistance anybody can render the North especially at the levels of children who otherwise become Almajeris.\n\nWithout a doubt the Presidential candidate of the NNPP will do very well in Kano where he might even defeat the PDP candidate.",

          "text": "\u201cWhat we are doing as a party is that we have changed the face of campaigning in the state, and you will discover that we have not done so much open campaigning in Ekiti State, this is deliberate. We have been embarking on stakeholders\u2019 meetings with every critical stakeholder in Ekiti State. We want to take feedback from them; we want to know their expectations, and we want to have one-on-one contact with them. This was done in all the units in Ekiti State and I believe that this has been helpful.\u201d \u2013 Oyebanji\n\nWhile growing up, in this columnist\u2019s days of yore, there was this famous advertisement tagline of a non-alcoholic drink that despite living then in apparently analogue age, went viral! It had the tagline: \u201cThe Difference is Clear!\u201d Several billboards were literally screaming with the advert; airwaves of radio were rent with it; the newsprint media was awash with it; the nascent television era caught the bug as well. Ubiquitous and unique in this depiction and display was the branding of some taxis in such a way that they were fitted with mounted mobile billboards of: \u201cThe Difference is Clear!\u201d The heavy advertisement investment paid up for the firm producing the drink \u2013 7Up! The sales shut up thus increasing the product\u2019s market share and temporarily outsmarted other competitors in the food and beverage industry of the time. Of course, the bottom lines of the manufacturing firm greatly improved to the excitement of the business owners, distributors, retailers and shareholders. There is something about the slogan: \u201cThe Difference is Clear!\u201d This is what in strategic studies is referred to as the Unique Value Proposition (UVP). According to Harvard Business School, Institute of Strategy and Competitiveness, \u201ca value proposition defines the kind of value a company will create for its customers. Finding a unique value proposition usually involves a new way of segmenting (differentiating) the market (sic).\u201d What were uniquely attractive to customers in 7Up that other notable competitors of that era did not possess? Simply and squarely stated: the size, shape, content and price of the drink! The bottle design was unique; the size was bigger and of course, the content was evidently magnanimous to consumers than other competitors in the market. Added to these was the unique and uncommon lower price penetration in the market with incentives to distributors to demand for more quantities.\n\nOne-on-one with Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO)\n\nThe race to Oke Ayoba, as Ekiti Government House is referred to in Ekiti common parlance, is nearing the finishing line with less than a week by the time this publication penetrates the public domain \u2013 exactly 6 days! Having been keenly following political developments and events in Ekiti for some years, this essayist, sought one-on-one interactive session with the candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (popularly called: BAO), in the June 18 Gubernatorial election in Ekiti. Despite his heavy campaign schedule, he was magnanimous and gracious in acceding to the request. Three salient questions were asked as they were three strong contenders, BAO of APC inclusive, in the race to Oke Ayoba. The others are: Engr. Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Chief Bisi Kolawole of the People Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nIt is good to hear from APC flag bearer himself:\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nIn less than a week, to the gubernatorial election coming up in Ekiti State, precisely on 18th June 2022, how confident are you that you would emerge as the winner of that election?\n\nBAO:\n\nI am confident of victory because I am not new to Ekiti people, we have come a long way; we have done a lot of things together. I have been with Ekiti people at every defining moment in their history as a state. I was part and parcel of the team that fought for the creation of Ekiti State. I was even the Secretary of that Committee and I put together the blueprint for the development of Ekiti State. This is at the communal level. At the governmental level, I have served Ekiti in various capacities for eleven years. Of all the people aspiring to that office, I am the most experienced in terms of understanding the nuances of governance in Ekiti State. Also, I have been selling my manifesto to every critical stakeholder in Ekiti State, and I believe that this has been helpful.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nThere are actually three main contenders in the election coming up on the 18th of June, Engr. Segun Oni, representing the Social Democratic Party (SDP); Chief Bisi Kolawole of the People Democratic Party (PDP) and you, BAO, flying the flag of the All Progressives Congress (APC), how do you think you can outsmart these other two contenders and emerge victorious?\n\nBAO:\n\nWhat we are doing as a party is that we have changed the face of campaigning in the state, and you will discover that we have not done so much open campaigning in Ekiti State, this is deliberate. We have been embarking on stakeholders\u2019 meetings with every critical stakeholder in Ekiti State. We want to take feedback from them; we want to know their expectations, and we want to have one-on-one contact with them. This was done in all the units in Ekiti State and I believe that this has been helpful because it has actually given us the opportunity to actually connect with the voters and to know their expectations which would help us by the time we get into government. Now that we have completed this one-on-one campaign, the house-to-house campaign is still on-going, as I speak, we now embark on an open campaign to garner support from our people (sic). The beauty of the house-to-house campaign is, it afforded us the opportunity to sell our manifesto to them and to hear from them one-by-one their expectations from the government. So, by the time we get to office, we would not be shooting from the dark, and I think this has been helpful and this one thing that we are doing differently from other parties. We have also massively engaged the youths on social media to get to the population on the social media and to take feedback from them. This is a game changer in the history of campaigns in Ekiti State and it has been extremely helpful.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nIf you can see yourself as the incoming Governor of Ekiti State come October 18, this year, what would you say, in your career both in the public service and private sector, is your Unique Value Proposition (UVP) or Unique Selling Proposition (USP) to Ekiti people in this regard?\n\nBAO:\n\nOn my Unique Value Proposition (UVP), I have been a major player in both the private and public sectors; and my eleven years\u2019 experience in governance has exposed me to the nuances of governance and also being a private sector person, it has also exposed me to the pains and issues in the private sector. One thing we are going to do, we are going to run a very smart government; we are going to rely heavily on the use of data because our margin of error must be reduced. We do not want to play with the future and aspirations of our people. So that our government would run smartly. We would do more with less. We are conscious of the precarious situation of our country; we are conscious of the dwindling federal allocation to states. We also know that expectations of the people keep increasing on a daily basis, so we must be able to navigate all these curves and deliver on the promises we have made to our people. And we can only deliver this by doing more with less, by prioritizing issues that will give happiness to the greatest number of our people; and by reducing wastes in governance; and by also ensuring that we rely more on the use of technology; and reduce our error margin to the barest minimum.\n\nWill Oyebanji Outsmart His Opponents?\n\nIn the introductory part of this article, there was the mention of the once famous 7Up advertisement. Analogous to the 7Up advertisement tagline, are there some Unique Value or Selling Proposition of the candidacy of Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO), of the All Progressive Congress (APC) that would be readily perceived by Ekitikete as they head for the polls this Saturday, 18th June 2022? This columnist, as a researcher and analyst, called on some people residing and/or working in Ekiti to decipher their understanding of the grassroot feelings, yearnings and longings of the Ekitikete regarding the possible outcome of the gubernatorial election. Virtually, the verdict is that BAO is on ground in all towns and villages in Ekiti and is going to carry the day if election is held as stipulated and devoid of violence, acrimony or irregularities. The 6 Point Actionable Strategic Agenda that encapsulates: 1. Youth Development and Job Creation; 2. Human Capital Development, 3. Agriculture and Rural Development, 4. Infrastructure and Industrialization, 5. Arts, Tourism and Culture; and 6. Governance, speak glowingly of the incoming government of BAO if voted into office by the good people of Ekiti State. Presently, a team of experts is working on the key performance indicators (kpis) that would be tailored and targeted whilst being tracked to ensure measurable performance from day one!\n\nConcluding remarks:\n\nIn concluding this piece, Ekitikete should follow a man with a veritable manifesto among the top contenders as BAO is seemingly the only one with such a document that is already being further worked upon by monitoring, evaluation and learning experts that will dovetail into tangible inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts in aligning with the Result Based Management (RBM) approach. Key performance indicators (kpis) are being established already with some having low hanging target dates for fruition \u2013 30 day; 60 day; 100 day, etc. Enough is enough of stomach infrastructure aspirants (politicians) offering fish without teaching Ekitikete how to catch fish! Imagine aspirants promising regular payment of salaries, pension and gratuity as a programme!! Any responsible employer should meet up with his obligation to his or her employees, be it in the private or public sector. Doing so is exhibiting responsibility rather than achieving a feat. Ekitikete should ask these other contenders what to expect from them at the end of one, two, three or four years!\n\nIn raising the level of awareness and participation in the electoral process, strategically, the BAO team engaged in some unique road shows \u2013 first of its kind in Ekiti. In these epoch-making shows, his avowed and vociferous supporters rent the air with shouts of \u201cBAO! BAO!! BAO!!!\u201d synonymous with the support of the people of such towns and villages for the party, APC, and the candidacy of Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO). It is BAO all the way crisscrossing all towns and villages of Ekiti.

          "title": "Boris Johnson has only delayed the inevitable",
          "text": "Boris Johnson lives to fight another day. Britain, meanwhile, lives to endure another day in his shadow, a bit part in the soap opera of his life, watching on as the drama is set on an endless doom loop from comic farce to tragedy.\n\nAfter months of turmoil over Johnson\u2019s behavior in office, in which he became the first sitting British prime minister ever to be fined for breaking the law, enough of his fellow Conservative members of Parliament finally plucked up the courage to trigger a formal vote of confidence in his leadership of the party. Had he lost, even by a single vote, the process to replace him as party leader\u2014and prime minister\u2014would have begun immediately, culminating in a new appointment within weeks\u2014the sixth British leader in the space of just 15 years, an astonishing period of political instability and failure. Yet, once again, this master of evasion somehow managed to escape, winning 211 votes to 148 to stay in post.\n\nThis \u201cvictory,\u201d however, marks just the beginning of Johnson\u2019s fight for survival. Each of his Tory predecessors who were challenged to a vote of confidence lost power soon after, many spectacularly. Even though each prevailed, for Margaret Thatcher, John Major, and Theresa May, the very fact of being challenged marked the beginning of the end.\n\nThe fundamental problem for Johnson is that he is now a populist who is no longer popular. This is no repeat of the Donald Trump impeachment drama, where the president might have been unpopular nationally but was protected by a wall of support from his base. In Britain, Johnson is opposed both in the country at large and among what should be the Tory grassroots. Appalled by revelations of drunken parties in 10 Downing Street during the COVID lockdowns, the country seems to have concluded that it will not vote for him again. And so long as the country feels this way, he is toast\u2014or, if he isn\u2019t, then the Conservative Party most certainly is.\n\nFor any prime minister, this is a deadly bind. It is especially so for Johnson, who was elevated to power not because Conservative parliamentarians ever particularly liked or respected him, let alone backed his political philosophy\u2014if such a thing exists\u2014but because they concluded that he was their only hope of saving the party from electoral oblivion. Johnson was the instrument necessary to \u201cget Brexit done,\u201d a phrase he repeated ad nauseam during the 2019 election campaign. Then, his character faults were less important than his political potential. Britain had voted to leave the European Union, but its political class had proved unable to fulfill this instruction, and so Johnson was given the power to enact the revolution the public demanded, overhauling the Conservative Party and the country in the process, and winning the biggest Tory majority in 30 years. At a stroke Johnson became the most radical and consequential prime minister since Thatcher and, it seemed, was destined to remain in office for as long. In 10 Downing Street soon after his election victory was confirmed, one of his aides told me that Johnson\u2019s was a 10-year project\u2014at least.\n\nThat was less than three years ago, but regardless of today\u2019s survival, he seems perilously close to having thrown it all away. He now faces a monumental challenge to turn this around, his authority, popularity, and political purpose lying in tatters with few obvious ways to put it all back together. And for what? A few parties in 10 Downing Street that broke the lockdown rules that he himself introduced, albeit so reluctantly that his delay cost the lives of more Brits than it ever should, but for which he never paid a political price. The entire episode is so pathetic. The entire episode is so fitting.\n\nThe irony is that we now seem to be watching the tragic chronicle of Johnson\u2019s political death foretold\u2014not just by his fiercest critics, who long ago warned it would end this way, but by the prime minister himself.\n\nAlone among the politicians I have covered, Johnson has seemed to so openly flash his own flaws at the public, almost daring them to join him on his journey of self-destruction. In his novel, Seventy Two Virgins, Johnson\u2019s main character\u2014essentially a caricature of himself\u2014even speculates about politicians wanting to watch their demise. \u201cThere was something prurient about the way he wanted to read about his own destruction,\u201d the protagonist says. \u201cJust as there was something weird about the way he had been impelled down the course he had followed.\u201d Why did Johnson write this, if not to tell us something about himself?\n\nJohnson\u2019s political life once appeared to be a sweeping epic, an unending rise to power that would ultimately reshape Britain and secure his place as one of the country\u2019s most important postwar leaders. Instead, this episode\u2014even though he has survived\u2014makes clear that his time in office now risks being more of a tragic novella, unless he can find even more dramatic ways to escape the bind he has put himself in.\n\nThe past few days have encapsulated both Johnson and Britain, highlighting inner truths about both, illustrating their deepest flaws, ones that will not go away whatever Johnson\u2019s fate.\n\nConfirmation that Johnson would face a vote of confidence came as Britons returned to work with something of a groggy head after four days of celebrating Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s Platinum Jubilee. Some Conservative members of Parliament, it now appears, submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson before the festivities had drawn to a close, but postdated them to ensure that nothing sullied the royal occasion.\n\nThis little detail neatly sums up a moment in 21st-century Britain that was both bonkers and brilliant, joyful and ludicrous, unifying and absurd\u2014an event that revealed something of the country\u2019s spirit while providing a vent for it. This was a festival in which a giant drone display above Buckingham Palace beamed images of corgis and handbags to a cheering crowd of thousands while Diana Ross warbled away onstage, and where street parties up and down the country created a rare and uplifting sense of national unity\u2014but one of the defining images of the weekend was the prime minister being booed as he walked up the steps to St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral to attend a thanksgiving service in honor of the Queen.\n\nHere was the extraordinary spectacle of a Conservative prime minister being jeered by a crowd of flag-waving monarchists. For some, the image was terminal for Johnson, proof he had lost the crowd. This fact remains, the elemental source of all of his problems that is not going away. Johnson has become a tribune of the people, without a people.\n\nIt is worth pausing to reflect that Johnson is far from unique in being loathed. In fact, he is just the latest British prime minister to be hated by the public with a vehemence that does not seem particularly healthy. Tony Blair remains a virtual pariah to this day, David Cameron a figure of open disdain, and Thatcher a source of such continuing hostility that a statue honoring her is egged by protesters. It is a strange quirk that Britain\u2019s worst prime ministers are now its most popular: Major, May, and Gordon Brown. Yet, each was driven from office in a wave of public hatred, horribly warped and disfigured in the process.\n\nWhere Johnson somewhat differs from his predecessors is that he has always seemed so open and sanguine about his fate and, in a sense, his own smallness. \u201cPolitics is a constant repetition,\u201d he once wrote. \u201cHow we make kings for our societies, and how after a while we kill them to achieve a kind of rebirth.\u201d Politics is not about grand plans and ideologies in Johnson\u2019s mind; it\u2019s a cynical ritual used by societies to keep on some kind of even keel, a ceremony of hypocrisy in which everyone is able to feel better about themselves by raising and then slaying the avatars of their hopes and fears. Politics, like life, drifts in and out of cycles\u2014not in a forward sweep. Problems remain; histories consume; leaders rise and fall.\n\nThe irony for Johnson is that this is now the fate he is battling to delay, while being fully aware that it will consume him in the end. Today, a sense of national unease and unhappiness, disunity and trouble hangs in the air alongside the very opposite feelings that were on display during the jubilee.\n\nThe conservative party is now trapped between those who have concluded that it needs to kill the king to achieve the requisite rebirth and those who think that it has not come to that yet. The risk for the party is that it achieves the worst of all worlds, leaving Britain to drift on in the doldrums, without a fair wind to propel it or a captain with the power to sail it.\n\nThe strange reality is that there is no real policy problem for Tory MPs at the core of this crisis. The ritual bloodletting we are going through once again is not being pursued in order to change anything other than the guy at the top. The music has stopped and Johnson is battling to stay perched on the throne, but little more than that.\n\nOf course the personality here is important, particularly so with Johnson. As the prime minister\u2019s fiercest critics have long warned, his character flaws are baked into who he is. What made him the popular choice for his party and the public in 2019 are the same flaws that make him so unpopular today: He is a mocking, disdainful observer of the serious and their codes of honor, someone who believes in the fleeting, cosmically tragic, and darkly comic reality of life\u2014and the power of Boris to rise above the rest, to poke his nose out of the celestial cloud even for a millisecond in the grand sweep of time. This makes him formidable and careless, historically-minded and shortsighted, endlessly jovial but melancholy, useful for smashing through old orders, but less good at imposing new ones.\n\nStill, should Johnson lose this battle to survive over the coming weeks or months, the fundamental problems that Britain faces will remain. It is true that character matters. The simple fact of Johnson remaining in power makes some diplomatic relationships in Europe harder to fix. Perhaps the country will be able to move on from Brexit only once all those associated with the campaign are gone too. Still, the candidates to replace him will almost certainly promise to maintain all of the major planks of his agenda. Indeed, some already have. Each will pledge to remain outside the EU and its economic zone; to stay hawkish in their support for Ukraine; and to revisit the Northern Ireland protocol that is the rot underlying Britain\u2019s troubled relationship with Europe. Each will promise to pursue new trade deals with countries around the world rather than prioritize one with the EU, to make the economy more competitive. Each will insist that they rebalance the economy to make northern England wealthier and to protect the \u201cred wall\u201d seats that Johnson won off Labour in 2019. The reality is that if Johnson goes, Johnsonism will survive in large part until the Labour Party manages to win an election. And even then, if Labour wins power under Keir Starmer, Brexit itself will not be reversed.\n\nBut just as much as Johnsonism will remain independent of Johnson, so too will all the problems that Johnsonism either was elected to address\u2014and has failed to\u2014or has actively exacerbated, and in some senses even created. Britain\u2019s long-term competitive decline continues, as does the shame of its internal border between Britain and Northern Ireland, and the appallingly uneven frontier now operating with France. The forces of nationalism pulling the country apart are not going away, a reality no party seems able to address in any serious fashion, while the endemic north-south divide that Johnson promised to resolve looks set only to get worse. And of course, there is still Brexit.\n\nBritain today is a country where religion has been replaced with a kind of state Shintoism in which the monarch is raised in exaltation while her chief ministers are ritually sacrificed to cleanse the nation of its sins. And all the while, nothing ever really changes. Deep-seated problems go unaddressed, left to fester, passed from one prime minister to the next, none of whom seems capable of even seeing the scale of the challenges they face, let alone addressing them. Johnson is just the latest prime minister to fail spectacularly at the job, though in his case, in uniquely grubby circumstances. He won\u2019t be the last.",

The gunmen were arresting only male young men. They ignored girls and women as well as elderly men.\n\n\u201cLater, they stormed the palace of our traditional ruler, Eze Nicholas Ibekwe, commanded all to lie down and fired about 20 gunshots into the air. They didn\u2019t kill anybody but we are hearing that some might have sustained gunshot injuries,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe traditional ruler of the community, Eze Nicholas Ibekwe, confirmed the incident. He disclosed that four of the gunmen stormed his palace and ordered everybody in his palace to lie face down.\n\nThe monarch narrated that before storming his palace, he had already got wind that gunmen were in custody of 15 of his subjects who were excavating sand at Njaba River.\n\nIbekwe disclosed that one of the youths alerted the community after his release. He said he was released because of his visual impairment.\n\nThe traditional ruler revealed that four of the gunmen did not cover their face but wore camouflage.\n\nEze Ibekwe further explained that one of the gunmen spoke Hausa language when he ordered those in his palace to lie down. He said one of the gunmen even accused him of harbouring criminals in the community.\n\nWhen contacted, the police spokesperson for the command, Michael Abattam, advised the community to lodge a formal report to the police division in the area.\n\nIn a related development, some heavily armed gunmen were said to have invaded the Boss FM radio station in Owerri at about 11:30 am on the same day, and abducted Prof Jachimike Adiele, a co-host of the Forum, a public affairs programme.\n\nA source at the radio station said the victim soon after he finished discussing the topic \u201cIgbo Presidency,\u201d was immediately taken away to an unknown destination by the gunmen who lay siege on the station.\n\nHowever, Abbattam said that Prof Adiele was actually not abducted but was arrested.\n\nHe said Adiele was arrested by the police for an offence which they did not specify.\n\nCo-host of the programme, Miss Ijeoma Harriet, who posted the incident on her Facebook page, recalled that: \u201cSome unidentified armed men stormed the premises of Boss Radio, Owerri and abducted the co-host (guest) of the forum, Prof Jachimike Adiele to an undisclosed location.\n\n\u201cWe cannot confirm his whereabouts, or his present state.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nNational Vice Chairman (North West) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Salihu Moh Lukman has warned that regardless of the religious and ethnic choice the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, makes in regard to his running mate, he will face a very keenly contested poll.\n\nIn a statement he issued in Abuja on Saturday, titled: \u201cIssues for APC 2023 presidential campaign\u2019, he wrote that if Nigeria is to move forward, 2023 presidential campaigns must not be reduced to sentimental considerations of ethnicity and religion.\n\n\u201cWith Asiwaju\u2019s victory, the debate has now shifted to the choice of running mate. As usual, conservative and reactionary ethno-religious consideration are colouring the debate. Question of Muslim-Muslim ticket, implying that another Muslim from the North will most likely be Asiwaju\u2019s running mate. Leading party members are already becoming strong advocates for or against a so-called Muslim \u2013 Muslim ticket. This debate is reproducing the old pre-convention reactionary and conservative campaign.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\n\u201cIf choices of leaders are dictated by ethno-religious factors, Nigerian politics will continue to be disadvantageous to many sections of the country. For instance, only Christian Southerners and Muslim Northerners will continue to have advantages. Most of those trying to use religious arguments to influence the choice of running mate for Asiwaju Tinubu are impliedly arguing that a Christian Northerner can only win presidential election if his/her running mate is a Muslim from Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the same way, this will be politically disadvantageous, if not impossible for any Christian from the North or Muslim from the South to win presidential election. Such a backward national mindset must be changed.\n\n\u201cThe challenge facing Nigerian politics is about opening the democratic space. It is not going to be easy, but Nigerians must be challenged to make hard choices. Important as ethnic and religious identities are, addressing challenges facing the country, require that political leaders are not allowed to ride on cheap sentiments of religion and ethnicity to opportunistically win elections.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria is to move forward, 2023 Presidential campaigns must not reduce important debates of moving Nigeria forward to sentimental considerations of ethnicity and religion. If the truth is to be told, both Islam and Christianity, as well as all our ethnic factors have been used in equal measure to hold Nigeria at a standstill.\n\n\u201cMany so-called religious and ethnic leaders have used and are still using religion and ethnicity to pollute the minds of Nigerians against one another. If Nigerian politics is to overcome the adversities of these so-called religious and ethnic leaders, religious and ethnic backgrounds of leaders must be subordinated to experiential attributes of persons being considered for leadership.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it is important to stress the point that whatever is the final choice of Asiwaju Tinubu and APC leaders with respect to who emerges as the running mate, the 2023 presidential election will be keenly contested, irrespective of religious and ethnic identity of both Asiwaju Tinubu and whoever the running mate may be. APC leaders must acknowledge the fact that the 2023 elections present another golden opportunity for the APC to re-invent itself,\u201d he warned.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*\u2018It\u2019s a threat to fragile peace, unity of Nigeria\u2019\n\n*Babachir: Nigerians conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics\n\n*El-rufai: Competence vital for running mate, not religion\n\n*Osinbajo promises to support Tinubu\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Northern Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) yesterday expressed opposition to alleged moves by the presidential candidates of Nigeria\u2019s two leading political party to present Muslim running mates for the 2023 presidential election, cautioning that Christians will reject any political party that fails to heed its warning.\n\n\n\nFormer vice president Atiku Abubakar, a Muslim holds the presidential flag of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) while Bola Tinubu, also a Muslim picked that of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) last Wednesday. The two are now searching for running mates.\n\n\n\nCAN and NOSCEF\u2019s caveats are coming on the heels of a similar one by the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, to the APC against a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, saying Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nBut Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State stressed yesterday that competence should determine his party\u2019s choice of presidential running mate instead of religion.\n\nOn the same day, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared his readiness to give total support to Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nCAN, in the statement signed by its National Secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola warned the two leading political parties to bury the thought of Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe want to unequivocally state that it is a threat to the fragile peace and unity of Nigeria,\u201d said CAN.\n\nIt urged all political parties to ensure that the balance of both religious practitioners is considered in the choice of running mates for the presidential candidates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do not subscribe to Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. Politicians can talk politics but we have stated our view long before now. Any party that tries same religion ticket will fail.\n\n\u201cThis is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christian ticket, the church still goes through hell. Only God knows the number of Christians that have been killed in the last seven years with no one apprehended or prosecuted.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power? The extant Nigerian Constitution promotes religious balance. So, if any political party wants to try Muslim/Muslim ticket, it\u2019s at its own peril. CAN is only forewarning, but will make a categorical statement in the event our warning is not heeded.\n\n\n\nCAN said, \u201cthe Presidential running mate of APC presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu should be a Christian from the North, Atiku\u2019s running mate should be a Christian from the South while Obi should choose his own among the Muslims from the North\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnything contrary to the above means that the leadership of these political parties do not bother about the unity of this entity called Nigeria. Those who are planning Muslim/Muslim ticket should also find out what was the outcome of MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket in 1993. If they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time around, the outcome will be worse because our fault lines are very visible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no party that has no great, good and patriotic Christians who can preside over the affairs of this nation not to talk of being the Vice President as some mischievous people are trying to say. If merit and competence are used as yardsticks, we have many qualified Christians in all the 774 Local Government Areas of this country,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nCAN said its leadership had tried in vain to get President Muhammadu Buhari to break the monopoly or dominance of the security architecture with people of same faith.\n\n\u201cWe are all seeing the outcome now. It is obvious that the Nigeria of today is different from that of 1993. Our politicians should stop flouting the Constitution by respecting the North and South dichotomy and religious factor. To those arguing that people do not care about the religions of their leaders once they are competent and credible, we dare APC to pick its Presidential running mate from the South and PDP pick its own from the North and see what follows.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the late sage, Papa Obafemi Awolowo picked Chief Mrs Oyibo Odinamadu, a fellow Christian and Southerner, as his runningmate in 1979, we all know the consequences of his performance in the North. Our politicians should be doing what will unite us instead of what will further polarise the country,\u201d it said.\n\nNorthern Christian Elders Oppose Muslim VP\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders Forum also sounded a note of warning that the country\u2019s diversity should be taken into consideration by Tinubu and Atiku while choosing their running mates.\n\nNOSCEF in its Democracy Day message to the nation, signed by its President, Ejoga Inalegwu, cautioned that Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets would be insensitive.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to all patriotic presidential candidates to avoid manipulative but dangerous and insensitive tickets that will further polarize the nation along religious lines when Nigerians are looking forward, with great expectations for a new dawn, come 2023; a new era and government devoid of politics of exclusion, discrimination and injustice.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the parties therefore, make efforts to meet the deadline for the submission of their presidential and vice-presidential candidates, NOSCEF wants to again appeal to political parties to be sensitive to the mood of the nation, the religious diversity of our people and show patriotism by avoiding any action that will throw up our lines of divide, merely to win elections rather than steps that will unite our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to believe that anyone with the credentials to rule this nation from 2023, should be sensitive enough and not be a candidate that would take us back to our religious divides, through the instrument of Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. We do not expect any patriot to, by so doing, again open the wounds for our past bitter religious divides.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need, as a nation, a united front to forge a new Nigeria, that will bring people together across religious divides because we do not lack quality across the religious and regional divides,\u201d it insisted.\n\nThe frontline group said that politicians should make deliberate efforts at avoiding playing the religious cards through such tickets and not turn around to accuse those who condemn their unpatriotic action as the culprits.\n\nBabachir: Muslim-Muslim Ticket Dead on Arrival\n\nA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has warned the APC against allowing a Muslim as running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, who is also a Muslim.\n\nLawal, who spoke on a television programme on Thursday pointed out that Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Tinubu would have been running mate to the President Muhammadu Buhari, when the latter became the candidate of the APC in 2014 but for the discouragement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThere are concerns that Tinubu, a Muslim, might be forced to pick a Muslim running mate from the North for political prpose.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if it was time for northern Christians allegedly marginalised to be placated with the nomination of one of them as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, Lawal said, \u201cI will answer this question in a roundabout way. A political party is in the business of winning elections and to win elections you need to get the votes to beat your opponents. The way I see it is that in choosing your vice-president; that must be paramount in your mind. You can have the best ticket but if you don\u2019t win elections, it is a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, whatever candidate we are going to choose, we will bear in mind that that vice-president will contribute to winning that election. How does he (or she) continue? It is either he (or she) is popular and can bring in the votes or he (or she) can bring the money that will help our logistics in getting out the votes, so we can win the elections.\n\n\u201cBut then, there is also the requirement that you want to run a united country; you want to run a country where you don\u2019t he friction in the society \u2013 peaceful, settled and everybody goes about their business.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, you must factor in Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities in politics. That is why, for example, in recognition of these peculiarities, the northern governors and the majority of us in the North felt that the presidency ought to shift to the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a requirement in the Constitution that it has to shift. There is no zoning. But it is so we can have a country that is united; that everybody can go about their business in a peaceful environment.\n\n\u201cIt could have been possible for a northern (presidential) candidate to emerge. But then, you would know that running the country in that manner would have the southern part of Nigeria (to be) hostile to that government. So, we allowed it to shift.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, extending that consideration to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have lived among the Christians and I know that among the Christians, the question of a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-go area. It is dead on arrival. Buhari himself, even at that time, had to drop this present presidential candidate (Tinubu) because of the tension of a Muslim-Muslim ticket. And we have not seen anything in the country that has changed significantly to allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it has worsened. The religious divide has increased. Tribal divisions have increased. Regional divisions have increased. So, it would be a good thing if APC would settle for a Muslim-Christian ticket because we know (that the) PDP, that is what they would do.\u201d\n\nEl-rufai: Competence Vital, Not Religion\n\nEl-rufai, who was asked to react to the clamour for Christians as running mates of the leading presidential candidates for 2023, declared that competence should be vital in the selection, not religion.\n\nThe Kaduna governor, who spoke on a television programme declared: \u201cYou are asking the wrong person because I don\u2019t look at people from the lens of Muslim Muslim or Christian Christian. Most of my friends are Christians.\n\nIt was Tunde Bakare, a Pentecostal pastor that invited me to CPC, not President Buhari. I don\u2019t think the business of governance has to do with religion, I think we should look for the best person for the job, let\u2019s look for competence, capacity. I am the wrong person to ask because in my state I looked and chose my deputy as a Christian woman. This fixation of Nigerians with religion is worrying.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo: I Will Support Tinubu to Win in 2023\n\nOsinbajo yesterday declared his readiness to give total support Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe also emphasized that he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nThe Vice President, who spoke in Abuja at the campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidential race, pledged his personal support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President, who came a distant third in the party\u2019s presidential primary on Wednesday, recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu Thursday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Vice President described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\u201d\n\n\n\nOshiomhole: Tinubu\u2019s Victory a Reaffirmation of His Capacity\n\nA former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole has described the victory of Tinubu as a reaffirmation of his much-acclaimed unique capacity.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole in a statement issued yesterday said the Presidential candidate of APC represents a movement.\n\nHe noted that he had no doubt that Nigerians, no matter their political persuasions, would readily recognize his unique abilities and accept him as the right person needed at this momentous time, to lead this nation and transcend all extant challenges.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole said: \u201cThis victory is a reaffirmation of your much-acclaimed unique capacity to headhunt, mobilize, motivate and empower the best minds, irrespective of their tribe or religion, and use their combined creative efforts to translate your vision into reality.\n\n\u201cThis is a key asset of leadership that you possess, which over the years has differentiated you from others and positioned you well above your contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou represent a movement, a force, full of energy and radiating hope of a brighter future to come, when Nigerians hand over to you the baton of leadership, which you are well prepared for and ready to accept with all its attendant responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSouth-West APC Congratulates Tinubu, Promises 90% of Region\u2019s Votes\n\nThe APC in the South-West under the chairmanship of Isaac Kekemeke has congratulated Tinubu on his election as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nThe South-West APC in a statement yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Ayo Afolabi, said Tinubu\u2019s victory was a proof of his popularity and acceptability all over the country.\n\nThe party said it believed Tinubu\u2019s emergence would translate to victory at the poll and it would bring about the massive turnaround needed by the country.\n\nThe party also assured Tinubu of its resolve to deliver 90 per cent of the region\u2019s votes during the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cWithout doubt, your election demonstrated an overwhelming support from Nigerians across the geo-political zones which was a clear indication that Nigerians want you as their next president.\n\n\u201cThe APC in the South-West stands by you in every step you take in the journey to the Presidency, and we like to assure you that we will deliver the votes of the South-West in not less than 90 per cent of total registered voters in the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are one with our governors, National Assembly members, State Assembly members, local governments and indeed all leaders and members of our great party within the South-West region at this movement.\n\n\u201cWe send you our hearty congratulations, and we pray that this will be the beginning of a turnaround for Nigeria in terms of security, economic development, infrastructural upgrading, agric development and housing for the entire population of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all Nigerians to stand up and be counted in this noble movement to build on the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari which will put Nigeria in its proper place in the comity of great nations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Aims to make APC guber candidate unelectable\n\n*In retaliation, APC nudges PDP\u2019s flagbearer with EFCC\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State yesterday ordered the prosecution of the immediate past governor of the state, Rotimi Amaechi and the 2023 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Tonye Cole, over their alleged involvement \u201cin the illegal sale of a number of state government\u2019s assets and disappearance of $50 million from the state\u2019s account without proof of where it was deployed.\u201d\n\n\n\nWike gave the order after swearing-in three new commissioners at the Government House, Port Harcourt.\n\nThe Rivers State Governor had in 2015 set up a Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the Amaechi administration and the panel thereafter indicted Amaechi, Cole and some others for corruption.\n\n\n\nWike directed the state\u2019s new Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zaccheus Adangor, to commence prosecution of the two men and the others immediately.\n\nHowever, analysts are of the view that the drive to prosecute Amaechi and Cole is aimed at making the APC governorship candidate unelectable.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce Cole is put on trial, and obviously will be convicted, his drive to become Rivers State governor ends,\u201d said the analysts.\n\n\n\nYesterday, Wike told his new Attorney General: \u201cYou\u2019re at a critical period where people want to know what the state is going to do with the Judiciary Panel of Inquiry after the Supreme Court judgement on it. Luckily, you came at the right time when we had preferred criminal charges against the former governor (Amaechi), Sahara Energy\u2019s Tonye Cole and the rest of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you are coming at the right time to take over the matter and to make sure it is prosecuted diligently. I don\u2019t want to hear excuses. Let the people see what happened to our money. The world will see how $50 million from our account was moved to a company without nothing to show whether there was a business.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor had last month stated that he may file charges against the former Minister of Transportation, following the Supreme Court judgment that dismissed Amaechi\u2019s appeal to frustrate investigation into activities of his administration.\n\n\n\nWike, who spoke during a media parley in Abuja, said the judgement had vindicated the Rivers State Government.\n\nBack then, he promised to meet with leaders of Rivers State to decide on whether to commence criminal prosecution of Amaechi and Cole, over the alleged sales of some valued state assets and diversion of state funds.\n\nThe governor said those whose fate would also be decided included the state\u2019s former Commissioner for Transport, George Tolofari.\n\n\n\nHe explained that on his assumption of office in 2015, the state government set up Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the Amaechi\u2019s administration.\n\n\n\nWike said: \u201cThe judicial panel was mandated to investigate the sale of the 150 Mega Watts gas turbine in Omoku, Afam 360 MW Gas Turbine, Trans-Amadi 136 MW Gas Turbine and the 75 MW Gas turbine in Eleme; Monorail Project; the sale of Olympia hotel; and non-execution of the contract for the construction of Justice Karibi-Whyte hospital after the Amaechi administration paid $39.2m to the contractor.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Wike yesterday stated that the attempt by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to arrest the state\u2019s PDP governorship candidate, Siminalaye\n\nFubara, would not be accepted, saying that the state government would not hesitate to charge the anti-craft agency for contempt.\n\nWike also directed Adangor to write a strong worded protest letter to the EFCC over the alleged harassment of Fubara.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the protest letter is predicated on the recent attempted arrest by officers of EFCC on Fubara, who he noted before his emergence as the PDP governorship candidate, had served as the Accountant General of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nWike said the era of impunity and flagrant disobedience to the rule of law is gone and his administration will not accept such action by EFCC.\n\n\n\nHe explained that before now, the Rivers State government had gotten a subsisting court judgment against the EFCC that it cannot investigate the state finances or its officers.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, there is also another judgment against EFCC by the PDP governorship candidate to enforce his fundamental rights, which has not been set aside.\n\n\n\nAnalysts are also of the view that the opposition APC in Rivers State are in retaliation, going after Fubara with EFCC, to also make him unelectable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Buhari stated this in a letter to the returning officer of the APC presidential primary convention and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, commending the success of the exercise.\n\n\n\nThe president, who later hosted Tinubu, said the APC presidential primary was one of the most competitive and peaceful in the history of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nBuhari\u2019s comments as came the APC national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, and members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (APC) visited Tinubu and pledged to work together to deliver him in the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nAPC governors from the northern geopolitical zones also paid a congratulatory visit to Tinubu, in an apparent signal of the start of intense search for a running mate that would help the party win next year\u2019s election.\n\n\n\nThe forum of former Deputy Governors of Nigeria, who were members of APC, said they trusted the leadership of the party and Tinubu to decide on the best running mate that would serve the interest of Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former President Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, joined other prominent personalities from around the world to congratulate Tinubu on his victory at the just concluded presidential primary of APC.\n\n\n\nBuhari, in the letter he personally signed and addressed to Bagudu, who is also the chairman of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), commended the role the Kebbi State governor played in the success of the primary election that produced Tinubu.\n\nHe asked members of the party to close ranks and work conscientiously for the success of the APC presidential candidate in the February 2023 poll, saying he looks forward to working closely with all the 22 APC governors to ensure Tinubu\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nThe president stated that the party\u2019s standard-bearer had the capacity, commitment, and particularly enviable track record of leading APC to electoral victory. He said the APC project was far from over \u201cand we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\u201d\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI was pleased to see how you were very professional and efficient in handling the sensitive political position of Chairman Progressives Governors Forum.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour commitment in pursuit of equity and fairness speaks volumes in the cooperation displayed by APC governors. This, indeed, demonstrates the camaraderie that brought us together over eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThe party primaries were peacefully conducted and the delegates have selected the candidate to carry the APC flag in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as a patriotic APC member and stakeholder, I trust that you will come together to work with our candidate to win the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn the past seven years in government, we have achieved a lot. However, we have a lot more to do. The APC project is far from over and we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur candidate, His Excellency, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is no stranger to you. He is our friend and brother. We know his commitment, his track record, and his capacity to lead our party to success. So, now is the time for all of us to come together and march forward, as we did in 2015, to a convincing APC victory.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working closely with APC governors to support Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all our APC candidates to success in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I wish our great party success in the 2023 elections, please, accept the assurances of my consideration and personal regards.\u201d\n\nBuhari played host to Tinubu, Thursday night, at the State House, Abuja. He received the presidential candidate at his official residence about 8.30pm.\n\n\n\nThe former Lagos State governor, who emerged victorious at the APC presidential primary in Abuja on Wednesday, was accompanied on the appreciative visit to Buhari by the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Oando Oil Plc, Wale Tinubu.\n\nTinubu was at the villa to thank the president for his support and successful hosting of the APC presidential primary. He vowed to sustain Buhari\u2019s legacies if elected president.\n\n\n\nCommending Buhari for helping to ensure a level playing field for contestants at the primary election, Tinubu said, \u201cHe promised the whole country and the world that he will build a legacy of transparency and consistency. Legacy of a level playing ground for all the aspirants. He will be committed to democratic principles and values. And he did so.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t endorse anybody, he didn\u2019t impose anybody, he did not, at any time, attempt to tinker with the process of this election to favour one tribe or the other. He was steadfast, he was trustworthy, he was dependable, he was a leader.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his selling point ahead of the 2023 election, Tinubu said he was clear-minded on his mission and possessed a wealth of experience from both the private and public sectors. He said he was \u201cready to hit the ground running same day and not mess up the legacy of progress and honesty that is left behind for me and handed over to me by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAdamu, NWC Members Pledge to Work Hard to Deliver Tinubu\n\nThe National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), led by the national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, visited the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, to congratulate him and give assurances that the party leadership would work diligently to deliver him as president.\n\nAdamu said during the visit, \u201cWe are here visiting you to join you in thanking God for giving you to us and to all Nigerians, by making you the presidential flag bearer of our party for the 2023 election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have come a long way; you have seen it all. I can tell you that we have a commitment beyond description, a commitment to deliver you as president. Our party has spoken loud and clear, and delivering the will of the people, our delegates have given you the mandate to lead.\n\n\u201cWe are all now your soldiers. We will follow you to the nooks and crannies of this country. We will not rest on your oars until we have delivered you as president.\u201d\n\n\n\nThanking the chairman and members of the NWC, Tinubu said, \u201cI am honoured by this visit. We are all members of the same party, and as such, belong to the same progressive family. I appreciate your visit, I truly feel as if I am with family members.\n\n\u201cI want to thank everyone of you individually and collectively. You have formed a very dynamic team in a short period of time. You have sent jitters to other parties that our party remains united, and you must continue to live up to expectations.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as I have done throughout my campaign, I assure you that I am ready to reciprocate and vindicate our efforts in making the ultimate sacrifice: relentless public service to our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cWe have begun a new story of greatness, prosperity in the history of our nation. You helped me to complete the introduction; we must now work together to etch the substance of the book itself. Our book will not be complete until you have delivered me as president.\u201d\n\n\n\nTinubu described the APC national chairman as a straightforward, focused, and courageous man, whom he had worked together with as a fellow-governor in 1999.\n\nThe former governor stated, \u201cI thank you and I reiterate my commitment to the greatness of our party. We must work together, we must not let our enemies, who want to divide us, succeed. We must not allow it. Almighty Allah will crown our work with success as we embark on the journey to a greater Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmong the NWC members who joined the chairman on the visit were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari; Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu; National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore; National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Felix Morka; National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Sulaimon Argungu; National Woman Leader, Dr. Betta Edu; and National Youth Leader, Mr. Dayo Abdullah Isreal.\n\nOthers were National Vice Chairman (South-west), Dr Isaac Kekemeke; National Vice Chairman (South-south), Chief Hon. Victor Giadom; and National Vice Chairman (North-east), Comrade Mustapha Salihu.\n\nNorthern APC Governors Visit Tinubu, as Search for Running Mate Begins\n\nSome members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Northern States Governors Forum, yesterday, paid a visit to the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nThe northern governors, who visited Tinubu, included governor of Kebbi State and Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya; Plateau State Governor, Simon Lanlong; and Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello.\n\n\n\nAlthough the purpose of the visit was not made public, sources said it might not be unconnected with the search for a running mate for Tinubu.\n\nAlready, there were speculations that the ruling party might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting, which was held behind closed-doors, was centred on a possible running mate to Tinubu in the 2023 election.\n\n\u2018Tinubu, APC Leadership to Choose Acceptable Running Mate\u2019\n\nFormer deputy governors, who were members of APC, assured that the leadership of the ruling party, as well as the presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, would choose the vice presidential candidate that would best serve the interest of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nChairman of the Forum of former Deputy Governors of Nigeria and former Deputy Governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, wondered why people were already speculating whether the ruling party would settle for a Musilm-Muslim ticket.\n\n\n\nImasuen said, \u201cWhy are we crying foul, when there is no smoke? I will tell you without any hesitation that the man we have chosen is a leader. When you choose a leader, you choose him to represent the people.\n\n\u201cHimself (Tinubu) and the party leadership, you can rest assured that they will bring the best vice presidential candidate that will best serve the interest of Nigeria. So, just be patient. I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going, because I\u2019m not the candidate and I\u2019m not the national chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe forum stated that the emergence of Tinubu as the standard-bearer of the party had sent jitters to the camp of the opposition party, which had realised the irreversible error they committed by choosing a presidential candidate against the mood of the nation.\n\nOsinbajo: Tinubu\u2019s Sterling Contributions to Democracy Stand Him Out\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo congratulated Bola Tinubu on his emergence as presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that his contributions to Nigeria\u2019s democracy and its progress stand him out.\n\n\n\nIn a congratulatory message dated June 9, 2022 and personally signed by him, the vice president, who came a distant third in the presidential primaries, enjoined all APC members to close ranks and work towards the success of Tinubu in the February 2023 presidential poll.\n\n\n\nThe vice president stated in the letter, \u201cI congratulate Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory at our party primaries and his emergence as the presidential candidate and flag bearer of our great party, the APC, for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election. I also congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and all leaders of the APC for a successful Special Convention and Presidential Primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor many decades, our flag bearer has shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation building. His sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand him out. His wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party\u2019s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo all members of our great party, regardless of who you voted for at the primaries, we must now unite behind our presidential candidate and flag bearer to ensure victory for our party in the 2023 elections. As true progressives, we must remain strong and united in pursuing our collective vision as a party towards building a country that can provide a decent life and livelihoods for all our people.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan Congratulates Atiku, Tinubu, Obi, Other Parties\u2019 Presidential Candidates\n\nFormer President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, congratulated the presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, that of APC, Bola Tinubu, and their counterpart in the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, as well as those of the other parties on their emergence as their parties\u2019 standard-bearers.\n\nJonathan also appealed to the political parties participating in the 2023 general election to base their campaigns on issues and shun violence during the electioneering.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president urged the candidates to run campaigns devoid of rancour and divisiveness, and utilise the opportunity to promote peace and unity.\n\nJonathan commended the candidates for their interest in leading the country, which he described as a demonstration of their commitment and belief in the progress of the nation.\n\n\n\nNoting that Nigeria was at a critical junction in its march to nationhood, as it grapples with security and economic challenges, Jonathan said the 2023 elections presented an opportunity to renew the dreams of the founding fathers and revitalise the economy.\n\n\n\nHe charged the candidates to, in their campaigns, eschew violence and acts that could encourage any form of bloodletting or exacerbate the national fault lines. He said it was the responsibility of all political leaders to strive to de-escalate the tension in the country.\n\n\n\nJonathan also reminded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies of their responsibilities, stressing that the significance of the 2023 election, imposes on them a historic burden to continue the process of deepening the reforms of our electoral system.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Afenifere urges Buhari to fish out perpetrators\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, gave an update on last Sunday\u2019s killing of 40 worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, saying the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) masterminded the dastardly attack.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, gunmen, again struck in Sabo area of Ondo town, in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state and have killed six men.\n\nBut a Pan-Yoruba Socio-Cultural Group, Afenifere, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to fish out perpetrators of last Sunday\u2019s terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nBriefing newsmen on Thursday at the end of the National Security Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, said security agencies had been directed to go after the perpetrators of the act and bring them to justice.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the motive of the terror group was believed to be pitting Nigerians against each other and making it appear as ethno-religious war.\n\n\n\nWhile noting that the ISWAP\u2019s imprints had been determined in the attack, he said arrests were yet to be made, and that, there was no ethnic agenda, urging Nigerians to unite and defeat the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cThe National Security Council, has just risen from its meeting today, which reviewed, very critically, all aspects of security situation in the country and came up with conclusions, commending the efforts of the military and other security agencies in mitigating the insurgency, particularly, in the Northeast, where the fundamentalists there have been weakened, degraded and equally in the Northwest, where the bandits are equally weakened, and the Northcentral, where we\u2019re engaged with pockets of bandits.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe council is quite concerned about the violent attack in Owo, Ondo State, and has been able to locate the perpetrators of that horrendous attack. From all indications, we are zeroing in on ISWAP, the Islamic State for West Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not an ethnoreligious thing, the animals in ISWAP wanting attention, recognition, are suspected to have launched that attack. We have directed all the agencies concerned to go after them and bring them to justice\u201d.\n\nAregbesola said the Council was also concerned about killings in the name of blasphemy and has directed the security agencies to go after perpetrators of two incidents that occurred in Sokoto State and Abuja recently.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are equally concerned about the spate of attacks in the name of blasphemy. The police have been directed to mobilise, identify and preempt all those involved in the blasphemy attacks in two areas of the country, namely Sokoto and Abuja, of recent. The assurance is that we are committed to maintaining law and order and providing adequate security for Nigerian citizens.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY has learnt that the attack on the Sabo area of Ondo town, in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state, happened in the wee hours of Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that the victims had been buried since Wednesday while one of the victims, who survived the attack was still receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in the state.\n\nEyewitness said the gunmen stormed the area on motorbikes around 12:30am and opened fire on innocent roadside petty traders.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThey came to our area (Sabo) on motorbikes and each was carrying three gunmen. All of a sudden, they started shooting people, who were mostly Suya and tea vendors. A J5 bus driver, who was on transit and stopped to eat was the first victim. They killed a guardsman and another shopkeeper, who was trying to lock up his shop and run away from the assailants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey again gunned down two young men, who were eating noodles at a Mai Shayi store. That makes five victims in Sabo alone. Again, they struck another area called Iba, where they also shot dead another man,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the development but said it was an armed robbery case, not a reprisal attack, stressing that the victims involved in the failed robbery were from Yoruba, Igbo and Northern extraction.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to state clearly that there was no reprisal attack on the Hausa Community at Sabo area in Ondo town or any part of the state as purported by war mongers.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, 7th of June, 2022, there was an attempted robbery on a J5 vehicle with plate no MKA \u2013 469 YJ carrying Onions and Potatoes coming from Zaria enroute Ore, had a stop over at Ondo town and was attacked by men of the underworld around 0110hrs .\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the cause of this attempt, the robbers shot the driver, while the motorboy escaped with bullet injury, a motorcyclist alongside the pillion and a passerby were also hit by stray bullets,\u201d noting that investigation had since commenced and effort was ongoing to arrest the assailants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Ondo State Command, Oyeyemi Oyediran, urged the people of the state to remain calm and disregard the fake news, as the rumour mongers are out to stir unnecessary chaos and disrupt the peace of the state. This is also to warn the peddlers of this fake news to desist as the Command will not fold its arms and let them shatter the peace being enjoyed in the state,\u201d the PPRO added.\n\n\n\nIt was against these developments that Afenifere, yesterday, paid a condolence visit to Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), in Akure, the state capital.\n\n\n\nLed by its national leader, Ayo Adebanjo, in company with other members, Adebanjo commiserated with the governor, the Olowo of Owo, the Catholic church and the poeple of the state over the ugly incident, even as he referred to the governor as a true son of Yoruba race, saying his courage in establishing Amotekun corps was typical of a true Yoruba man.\n\n\n\nThe Afenifere leader, particularly, commended Akeredolu for doing his best to secure not only the state but the South-West region, adding that the security situation in the Southwest could have been worse, but for the establishment of the Amotekun corps.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe elections we are going into will be an exercise in futility if we don\u2019t change the constitution. We want state police and restructuring before the elections. So, change the constitution before moving further,\u201d Adebanjo insisted.\n\n\n\nHe saluted the courage and stance of the governor on issues of national importance, saying Akeredolu has always demonstrated that he was a politician with a second address.\n\nThe Afenifere leader insisted on the change of the constitution to give the country a people\u2019s constitution and equal opportunity to all.\n\n\n\nHe said Nigerians were currently suffering under what he called \u201cmilitary imposed fraudulent constitution\u201d.\n\nThe group, however, donated N1.5m to the church and victims of the attack.\n\nSpeaking, Akeredolu appreciated them for visiting and, noted that his administration would not back down on its Anti-open Grazing Law.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we have suffered is not just gruesome, for me it is like an annihilation, because these animals in human\u2019s skin did not come to kidnap, because they picked nobody. They did not come to steal, because they took no Kobo. But they came to maim and kill. So, that is why we have never minced words to say they are terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been reading the news, and I think this incident is the most internationalised incident in Nigeria ever. Today, the Pope is talking and tomorrow the House of Common is debating, everybody is talking. I have got calls from many people, I have gotten letter from the US Embassy and others. Everybody is worried, I\u2019m worried myself.\n\n\u201cIf we were at war, it was not possible for us to lose 40 people in a day, because we would all be armed and face each other. If you visit the hospitals, one will feel even worse. I have been to all the hospitals over and over, there is no way the visit will not bring tears to your eyes,\u201d the governor added.\n\n\n\nOther Afenifere leaders with Adebanjo included the deputy national leader, Oba Oladapo Olaitan; former Governor of Ogun State, Chief Gbenga Daniel; former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Olu Falae; Tunji Alapinni, Sola Ebiseni, and Korede Duyile, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Community Residents In South-East Nigeria, Others Desert Homes Over Rise In Ritual Killings",
          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house.

          "text": "Some residents of Isiala-Ngwa and Ihiala in Abia and Anambra states have fled their homes over the rising cases of ritual killing in those places.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters reliably gathered from fleeing residents that people were being hacked to death and their bodies mutilated by unknown persons, who go away with vital organs.\n\nA resident of Isiala-Ngwa named Ifeanyi Okoli, disclosed that persons had been disappearing from the area mysteriously with their mutilated bodies later discovered in the bush or roadside.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, at least four persons have been killed in this manner in recent times with the dismembered body later found.\n\n\n\nAs a result of this, some residents afraid for their safety have been moving out of the place to other areas they consider safe enough.\n\n\n\n\"I moved away from the community more than one week ago over the rise in mysterious deaths and mutilated bodies.\n\n\n\n\"Ritual killings subsided here a bit some time ago but it appears the evil has returned.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is living in fear around this place because they don't want to be a victim of ritual killing,\" Okoli said.\n\n\n\nA community leader in the area, Ezekiel Mba, told SaharaReporters that they were worried about the situation, adding that ritual killers were wreaking havoc around Isiala-Ngwa.\n\n\n\n\"The police and other law enforcement agencies should come to our aid before it is too late.\n\n\n\n\"We don't have peace of mind again, ritual killers are causing serious problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\nMore residents are contemplating moving out of the area as a result of the situation, SaharaReporters gathered.\n\n\n\nIn Anambra, a student of Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, under Ihiala Local Government Area of the state, Kelechi Anyoku, told SaharaReporters that some of her colleagues in the area had moved out of their apartments following rising ritual killings and diabolical attacks in the region.\n\n\n\nShe said at least three mutilated bodies had been discovered along a major highway linking the town and other parts of Anambra in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"Both the student population and residents of the local government area, everybody is afraid and seriously concerned about the ongoing development.\n\n\n\n\"At least three bodies with several parts removed have been discovered in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\"This is in addition to rituals like Okeite that young men do around this region. This is common among Internet fraudsters known as \u2018Yahoo Boys\u2019, who release semen inside a lady and after sometime it decays inside her with the guy getting rich in the process.\n\n\n\n\"Many young ladies have been affected by this ritual, so a lot of us are afraid, we are careful of the places we go to these days,\" she said.\n\n\n\nUli and Ihiala communities share proximity with Okija \u2013 a sleepy town that shot to prominence in 2004 after decomposing human bodies were found at a shrine inside one of its forests during a police invasion.\n\n\n\nCurrent Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, was in 2003 forced to take an oath of loyalty at the shrine by his then political godfather, Chris Uba, before he contested the state's governorship election and won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party that year.\n\n\n\nThe Court of Appeal on March 15, 2006, nullified Ngige's victory, paving the way for Peter Obi of the All Progressive Grand Alliance to assume leadership of Anambra.\n\n\n\nDisturbed by the latest development, a resident of Uwabakwem, a village close to Okija, Obinna Anokuru, told SaharaReporters that the activities of ritual killers were forcing people to move to safer places over fear for their lives.\n\n\n\n\"Everybody is afraid. The things happening these days are causing panic.\n\n\n\n\"Those of us who live here now ensure that we don't move far away from our houses late in the night or go anywhere without letting our family members know about our movement.\n\n\n\n\"It is the height of wickedness for somebody to kill a fellow human for ritual purposes. Something urgent has to be done about this evil in our land,\" he said.\n\n\n\nApart from the South-East, ritual killers especially individuals craving quick wealth have also been running riot in other parts of Nigeria, hacking both young and old to death in cruel ways.\n\n\n\nA recent security alert by the police identified Ota, Lambe and Mowe in Ogun State, Ikorodu in Lagos, Ilorin in Kwara, Osogbo in Osun, and Oyo State as the major hubs of ritual killings in the South-West.\n\n\n\nIn an incident that shook Nigeria to its roots, a 20-year-old girl, Sofiat Kehinde, was on February 4, 2022 hacked to death in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by four boys for money ritual purposes.\n\n\n\nThe victim's boyfriend, Majekodunmi (19); his friend, Mustaqeem Balogun (her 18-year-old ex-boyfriend); and two accomplices killed Kehinde and were burning her head in preparation for a ritual when they were discovered and arrested.\n\nEarlier on January 6 this year, residents of Otuja Harmony Estate in the Ikorodu area of Lagos raised the alarm over the constant invasion of a cemetery in the community by suspected ritualists scavenging for human parts.\n\n\n\nFive days later, the police in Ikorodu apprehended a mother and her son for being in possession of fresh human parts.\n\n\n\nThe son named Afeez Olalere disclosed that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger sibling for a money ritual.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mother took me to an herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the Yahoo business (internet fraud), I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me,\" he said.\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, two siblings, Monsuru Tajudeen and Lawal Tajudeen, were arrested by the police in the Iwo area of Osun State after a ritual den was discovered.\n\n\n\nIn other parts of the South-West, ritual murders were equally rife in the outgone year with law enforcement agencies unable to nip the menace in the bud.\n\n\n\nAccording to General Secretary, Traditional Religion Worshipers\u2019 Association in Oyo State, Femi Fakayode, the lack of appropriate sanctions for persons found to be involved in ritual killings in Nigeria is responsible for the rise in the disturbing trend.\n\n\n\nFakayode told SaharaReporters that no genuine traditional priest will perform money rituals involving the killing of a human because such is forbidden in their line of work and comes with severe repercussions.\n\n\n\nHe said those carrying out such rituals for young people seeking quick wealth will suffer the consequences no matter how powerful they may think they are.\n\n\n\n\"Check all the reported cases and those arrested for carrying out money rituals for members of the public, you will realise that none are traditional priests. Most of them are alfas.\n\n\n\n\"No real traditional priest will do such because the punishment is instant.\n\n\n\n\"These killings thrive because our laws are weak and punishment is almost non-existent for serious crimes especially when the offender has money to bribe officials.\n\n\n\n\"In our traditional system, the punishment for such heinous act is instant. You can't escape it.\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, we must go back to the traditional system, the way we operated before alien religion came in.\n\n\n\n\"If we go back to that system, even our leaders who are looting our treasury and destroying the country will buckle down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nRenowned traditional priest, Chief Yemi Elebuibon, told SaharaReporters that those killing fellow humans thinking that it would make them rich are wasting their time as there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to them.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, only honest and genuine labour could bring money and wealth in the long haul.\n\n\n\n\"There is really nothing like money rituals, there is no spirit anywhere that will bring money to you in your house. That idea is erroneous and unfortunately many young people in Nigeria today are falling for it.\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways out of this problem is for government to create jobs for youths across the country to get them productively engaged. A lot of them are idle and that is why the desire to make quick money is rampant among them.\n\n\n\n\"It is very sad how we have come to this point where people just kill another human because they want to be rich. It is sad,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSpokespersons for the police in Abia and Anambra states, Geoffrey Ogbonna and Ikenga Tochukwu, when contacted by SaharaReporters on Thursday, said that the cases will be looked into and appropriate measures would be taken to tackle the menace.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the House of Representatives called for the declaration of a national emergency of the rising cases of ritual killings across Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMinority Leader of the House, Mr Toby Okechukwu, moved the motion during plenary at the lower chamber of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHe and his colleagues urged the National Orientation Agency and other stakeholders in the society to embark on vigorous campaigns to open the eyes of members of the public especially youths to the evils of ritual killings for money.\n\n\n\nBut according to a Lagos-based sociologist, Nike Adetutu, tackling this dangerous trend in Nigeria will also require the return to core morals and values in society.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, training and monitoring at the family level has broken down and that is why there are young people with misplaced priorities and poor orientation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\"We must go back to the family system, where everything starts, we have failed in that area as a society.\n\n\n\n\"Parents are no longer giving the right training and monitoring to their children and that is why many of them have gone astray.\n\n\n\n\"The return to core morals and values will save us from all these problems.

          "title": "Tinubu and Atiku: Birds of a feather",
          "text": "Disappointment was powdered on the faces of many of the young people around me when Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo did not win the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). To them, Osinbajo was one candidate they could connect with: articulate, urbane, agile and modern. One who is connected to the ordinary Nigerian \u2014 he is there for them when there is a blast, when there is a gruesome murder, when there is an accident or when there is a terror attack. I argued with quite a number of them that party politics is about structure and alliances, that it would be easier for Osinbajo to win a general election than the APC presidential ticket. It sounded like Greek to them.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu, on the other hand, comfortably won the race for the APC ticket, sweetened by the amazing depth of support from northern governors and a spate of withdrawals by his rivals. The joke of the day was that while other contestants were busy buying delegates, Tinubu was buying the aspirants. However, restricting Tinubu\u2019s victory to the single narrative of his financial power will not tell the whole story. For decades, Tinubu had been building a national and battle-tested political structure to actualise his life ambition of becoming president of Nigeria. What happened at the Eagle Square was more than what we saw at the Eagle Square.\n\nAll efforts had been made to stop Tinubu in the last couple of years. The ouster of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the APC national chairman, the prolonged stay of Mai Mala Buni as the caretaker chairman, the last-minute truncation of the election of Senator Tanko Al-Makura as APC chairman, the adoption of Senator Abdullahi Adamu as party chairman, the battle over whether or not there should be direct or indirect primaries, and the last-minute introduction of Senate President Ahmad Lawan into the race, among other things, were all contrived to stop Tinubu. Even the removal of Mallam Ibrahim Magu as EFCC chairman was allegedly because of his closeness to Tinubu.\n\nAfter the election of the new national working committee (NWC) in March 2022 in which Tinubu could get only one of his nominees on board, obituary writers were already preparing a draft article on the end of his political career. I do not have all the inside details, but the week leading to the June 6-8 presidential convention apparently proved to be probably the most important in Tinubu\u2019s career: he got the northern governors to insist on power shift to the south, thereby stalling a real attempt to foist Lawan on others as the \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d. Any politician in an underdeveloped democracy who triumphed in spite of these high-level plots and schemes deserves respect, no matter how tiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the convention, President Muhammadu Buhari had asked the governors to let him choose his successor to reciprocate his relationship with them. Unlike President Olusegun Obasanjo, Buhari never removed any governor. He did not impose a successor on any. When he asked them to reciprocate his gesture, the impression we got was that he was about to pick someone, present him to them and that would be a done deal. But the rumour that Lawan, another northerner, was the one about to be anointed raised the temperature in the room. Adamu even confidently informed the APC NWC that Lawan was the chosen one. The response was hostile. The idea was brought in dead.\n\nBuhari finally backed down, basically saying he was no longer going to choose his successor. There is a lot to say about the way Buhari handled his succession, but we can forgive him because there is also a lot to say about how he has handled almost every important matter since he came to office in 2015. But it appears his strategists, assuming they can be so called, were only interested in stopping Tinubu. They became stuck when Tinubu refused to budge. It was complicated by the Electoral Act which clearly stipulates how a consensus candidate can be picked: every aspirant must agree to withdraw \u2014 and in writing. Tinubu was never going to agree. Never. He always wanted a contest.\n\nThe stage is now getting set for a grand battle between Tinubu and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential flagbearer of the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). This is not an attempt to rule out other candidates \u2014 I still believe the gap between the primaries and the elections proper is so long a lot can still happen along the way. But if we use current data for our workings, APC and PDP are the top political parties by a million miles. Both of them control over 95 per cent of elective offices across Nigeria. Any party that wants to upset this has to build a nationwide support base between now and the 2023 general election. That is the home truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there is virtually nothing to choose between Tinubu and Atiku. They are birds of a feather. Both are products of the botched transition programme of President Ibrahim Babangida that was to birth the Third Republic in 1993. A friend calls them \u201cClass of \u201993\u201d. They both belonged to the Peoples Front of Nigeria (PFN), the baby of Maj-Gen Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua (rtd). Other notable members were Babagana Kingibe, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (Shehu\u2019s younger sibling who would be elected president in 2007). The association was not registered as a party and was forced to dissolve into the government-created Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1989.\n\nTinubu, meanwhile, was elected as a senator in 1992 while Atiku sought to be governor of the newly created Adamawa state. He won the governorship primary election but was disqualified by the military government which was in the habit of cancelling elections. But Atiku would later enter the presidential race when the older Yar\u2019Adua, his mentor, was disqualified after winning the SDP presidential primary in 1992. The primaries of the two parties \u2014 the other being the National Republican Convention (NRC) \u2014 had been cancelled and \u201cold breed politicians\u201d banned, so Yar\u2019Adua entered Atiku as his horse in the new race in 1993. Atiku lost. Bashorun MKO Abiola got the ticket.\n\nTinubu and Atiku remained friends but while the former vice-president participated in the transition programme of Gen Sani Abacha in 1997/98, Tinubu was in exile funding pro-democracy agitations in Nigeria. When Abacha died and a new transition programme was rolled out, Tinubu and Atiku found themselves in different camps \u2014 Atiku pitched his tent with the PDP and Tinubu opted for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) which was made up of the forces that opposed Abacha and the annulment of Abiola\u2019s victory. Despite being in different parties, they remained close and Atiku is reputed as helping Tinubu escape the PDP tsunami that swept through the south-west in 2003.\n\nWhen Atiku fell out with Obasanjo ahead of the 2007 elections, his political career looked over. Obasanjo made sure Atiku would not have any pathway in the PDP to run for president. Tinubu, it was, who offered Atiku a way out \u2014 by giving him the ticket of the Action Congress, the party he formed after pulling out of AD in 2006 because of some internal crisis. But Obasanjo was so determined to stop Atiku that he set up an administrative panel to indict him and Prof Maurice Iwu, then-chairman of INEC, quickly dropped Atiku\u2019s name from the ballot. Atiku headed for the courts. Iwu warned us that even if the courts ruled otherwise, it would come too late to reinstate Atiku.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it later happened, Atiku won his case at the Supreme Court. In fact, Obasanjo declared an emergency public holiday to make sure the court would not be able to sit to deliver judgment, but it all failed. In the end, Iwu organised a sham of a presidential election in 2007, announcing final results while votes were still being counted. In the history of Nigeria, it is only the 2007 presidential election that does not have a state-by-state breakdown. Iwu simply sat down in Abuja and reeled out incredible figures as the final result, even saying only the PDP had a national structure to win a presidential election. He lambasted opposition parties for questioning the conduct and outcome.\n\nAtiku would abandon AC (later renamed Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN) and return to PDP in 2010 to continue his presidential pursuit. It appeared it was at this juncture that Tinubu and Atiku finally parted ways. He felt Atiku should have stayed back to build a strong opposition but was being opportunistic by returning to the PDP because of Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s ill-health and eventual death. But they came back together again in 2013 when the major opposition parties formed the APC. This time, Tinubu was with Buhari and served as a counterforce to Atiku to whittle down his war chest at the presidential primary in 2014. Atiku returned to the PDP years later, after failing to get APC\u2019s ticket.\n\nAtiku and Tinubu are alike on the economic front: they are private sector players who believe in a free market economy, so either would be expected to carry out reforms with significant impact on the economy, including deregulation of the downstream sector and exchange rate. Some will argue that both are of the same age bracket and should have retired from politics for fresher brains and more agile bodies. It is a debate that will not die down any time soon as their supporters market them aggressively. I expect plenty friendly fire in the electioneering. What\u2019s more, both men are perceived to be corrupt, although there have been no convictions since they left office 15 years ago.\n\nFinally, both are Muslims \u2014 but Atiku enjoys the luxury of picking a Christian from the south as his running mate. Tinubu is facing what Abiola had to confront in 1993: choosing between a paperweight northern Christian and a heavyweight northern Muslim. Nigerian presidential politics has been pre-programmed thus: if it is a northerner, it must be a Muslim; if it is a southerner, it must be a Christian. Will this be reversed so that it can be a southern Muslim and a northern Christian? Or will religion take the back seat? Tinubu has more thinking and tinkering to do in the coming days. Any direction he faces has implications. But that apart, Tinubu and Atiku are two peas in a pod.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\nA high court in Akure, Ondo state, on Friday sentenced three persons to death for the murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Reuben Fasoranti, the former leader of Afenifere. The 58-year-old woman was killed by attackers, referred to as \u201cherdsmen\u201d, in 2019 as she made to escape what looked like a robbery-cum-kidnapping operation. The sentencing will not lessen the pain but there is a feeling of justice being served. In 2017, seven people were sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping Chief Olu Falae. I commend the Ondo state government for bringing these criminals to justice \u2014 as it should be \u2014 instead of lamenting and crying conspiracy all the time. Progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNO WOMAN NO FLAG\n\nOf all the presidential flagbearers that have been elected so far, none is a woman. I am assuming I have seen the full list. This is a collective embarrassment at a time the world is promoting gender equity. Unfortunately, there are nil chances that the major parties will pick women as running mates, so we are not even talking of a mitigation here. It is only in Adamawa state that a major party will field a female governorship candidate but that is better than zero. I am not too enthusiastic about the possibility of a preponderance of women as deputy governorship candidates.

          "text": "Disappointment was powdered on the faces of many of the young people around me when Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo did not win the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). To them, Osinbajo was one candidate they could connect with: articulate, urbane, agile and modern. One who is connected to the ordinary Nigerian \u2014 he is there for them when there is a blast, when there is a gruesome murder, when there is an accident or when there is a terror attack. I argued with quite a number of them that party politics is about structure and alliances, that it would be easier for Osinbajo to win a general election than the APC presidential ticket. It sounded like Greek to them.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu, on the other hand, comfortably won the race for the APC ticket, sweetened by the amazing depth of support from northern governors and a spate of withdrawals by his rivals. The joke of the day was that while other contestants were busy buying delegates, Tinubu was buying the aspirants. However, restricting Tinubu\u2019s victory to the single narrative of his financial power will not tell the whole story. For decades, Tinubu had been building a national and battle-tested political structure to actualise his life ambition of becoming president of Nigeria. What happened at the Eagle Square was more than what we saw at the Eagle Square.\n\nAll efforts had been made to stop Tinubu in the last couple of years. The ouster of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the APC national chairman, the prolonged stay of Mai Mala Buni as the caretaker chairman, the last-minute truncation of the election of Senator Tanko Al-Makura as APC chairman, the adoption of Senator Abdullahi Adamu as party chairman, the battle over whether or not there should be direct or indirect primaries, and the last-minute introduction of Senate President Ahmad Lawan into the race, among other things, were all contrived to stop Tinubu. Even the removal of Mallam Ibrahim Magu as EFCC chairman was allegedly because of his closeness to Tinubu.\n\nAfter the election of the new national working committee (NWC) in March 2022 in which Tinubu could get only one of his nominees on board, obituary writers were already preparing a draft article on the end of his political career. I do not have all the inside details, but the week leading to the June 6-8 presidential convention apparently proved to be probably the most important in Tinubu\u2019s career: he got the northern governors to insist on power shift to the south, thereby stalling a real attempt to foist Lawan on others as the \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d. Any politician in an underdeveloped democracy who triumphed in spite of these high-level plots and schemes deserves respect, no matter how tiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the convention, President Muhammadu Buhari had asked the governors to let him choose his successor to reciprocate his relationship with them. Unlike President Olusegun Obasanjo, Buhari never removed any governor. He did not impose a successor on any. When he asked them to reciprocate his gesture, the impression we got was that he was about to pick someone, present him to them and that would be a done deal. But the rumour that Lawan, another northerner, was the one about to be anointed raised the temperature in the room. Adamu even confidently informed the APC NWC that Lawan was the chosen one. The response was hostile. The idea was brought in dead.\n\nBuhari finally backed down, basically saying he was no longer going to choose his successor. There is a lot to say about the way Buhari handled his succession, but we can forgive him because there is also a lot to say about how he has handled almost every important matter since he came to office in 2015. But it appears his strategists, assuming they can be so called, were only interested in stopping Tinubu. They became stuck when Tinubu refused to budge. It was complicated by the Electoral Act which clearly stipulates how a consensus candidate can be picked: every aspirant must agree to withdraw \u2014 and in writing. Tinubu was never going to agree. Never. He always wanted a contest.\n\nThe stage is now getting set for a grand battle between Tinubu and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the presidential flagbearer of the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). This is not an attempt to rule out other candidates \u2014 I still believe the gap between the primaries and the elections proper is so long a lot can still happen along the way. But if we use current data for our workings, APC and PDP are the top political parties by a million miles. Both of them control over 95 per cent of elective offices across Nigeria. Any party that wants to upset this has to build a nationwide support base between now and the 2023 general election. That is the home truth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, there is virtually nothing to choose between Tinubu and Atiku. They are birds of a feather. Both are products of the botched transition programme of President Ibrahim Babangida that was to birth the Third Republic in 1993. A friend calls them \u201cClass of \u201993\u201d. They both belonged to the Peoples Front of Nigeria (PFN), the baby of Maj-Gen Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua (rtd). Other notable members were Babagana Kingibe, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua (Shehu\u2019s younger sibling who would be elected president in 2007). The association was not registered as a party and was forced to dissolve into the government-created Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1989.\n\nTinubu, meanwhile, was elected as a senator in 1992 while Atiku sought to be governor of the newly created Adamawa state. He won the governorship primary election but was disqualified by the military government which was in the habit of cancelling elections. But Atiku would later enter the presidential race when the older Yar\u2019Adua, his mentor, was disqualified after winning the SDP presidential primary in 1992. The primaries of the two parties \u2014 the other being the National Republican Convention (NRC) \u2014 had been cancelled and \u201cold breed politicians\u201d banned, so Yar\u2019Adua entered Atiku as his horse in the new race in 1993. Atiku lost. Bashorun MKO Abiola got the ticket.\n\nTinubu and Atiku remained friends but while the former vice-president participated in the transition programme of Gen Sani Abacha in 1997/98, Tinubu was in exile funding pro-democracy agitations in Nigeria. When Abacha died and a new transition programme was rolled out, Tinubu and Atiku found themselves in different camps \u2014 Atiku pitched his tent with the PDP and Tinubu opted for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) which was made up of the forces that opposed Abacha and the annulment of Abiola\u2019s victory. Despite being in different parties, they remained close and Atiku is reputed as helping Tinubu escape the PDP tsunami that swept through the south-west in 2003.\n\nWhen Atiku fell out with Obasanjo ahead of the 2007 elections, his political career looked over. Obasanjo made sure Atiku would not have any pathway in the PDP to run for president. Tinubu, it was, who offered Atiku a way out \u2014 by giving him the ticket of the Action Congress, the party he formed after pulling out of AD in 2006 because of some internal crisis. But Obasanjo was so determined to stop Atiku that he set up an administrative panel to indict him and Prof Maurice Iwu, then-chairman of INEC, quickly dropped Atiku\u2019s name from the ballot. Atiku headed for the courts. Iwu warned us that even if the courts ruled otherwise, it would come too late to reinstate Atiku.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it later happened, Atiku won his case at the Supreme Court. In fact, Obasanjo declared an emergency public holiday to make sure the court would not be able to sit to deliver judgment, but it all failed. In the end, Iwu organised a sham of a presidential election in 2007, announcing final results while votes were still being counted. In the history of Nigeria, it is only the 2007 presidential election that does not have a state-by-state breakdown. Iwu simply sat down in Abuja and reeled out incredible figures as the final result, even saying only the PDP had a national structure to win a presidential election. He lambasted opposition parties for questioning the conduct and outcome.\n\nAtiku would abandon AC (later renamed Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN) and return to PDP in 2010 to continue his presidential pursuit. It appeared it was at this juncture that Tinubu and Atiku finally parted ways. He felt Atiku should have stayed back to build a strong opposition but was being opportunistic by returning to the PDP because of Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s ill-health and eventual death. But they came back together again in 2013 when the major opposition parties formed the APC. This time, Tinubu was with Buhari and served as a counterforce to Atiku to whittle down his war chest at the presidential primary in 2014. Atiku returned to the PDP years later, after failing to get APC\u2019s ticket.\n\nAtiku and Tinubu are alike on the economic front: they are private sector players who believe in a free market economy, so either would be expected to carry out reforms with significant impact on the economy, including deregulation of the downstream sector and exchange rate. Some will argue that both are of the same age bracket and should have retired from politics for fresher brains and more agile bodies. It is a debate that will not die down any time soon as their supporters market them aggressively. I expect plenty friendly fire in the electioneering. What\u2019s more, both men are perceived to be corrupt, although there have been no convictions since they left office 15 years ago.\n\nFinally, both are Muslims \u2014 but Atiku enjoys the luxury of picking a Christian from the south as his running mate. Tinubu is facing what Abiola had to confront in 1993: choosing between a paperweight northern Christian and a heavyweight northern Muslim. Nigerian presidential politics has been pre-programmed thus: if it is a northerner, it must be a Muslim; if it is a southerner, it must be a Christian. Will this be reversed so that it can be a southern Muslim and a northern Christian? Or will religion take the back seat? Tinubu has more thinking and tinkering to do in the coming days. Any direction he faces has implications. But that apart, Tinubu and Atiku are two peas in a pod.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\n\nA high court in Akure, Ondo state, on Friday sentenced three persons to death for the murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Reuben Fasoranti, the former leader of Afenifere. The 58-year-old woman was killed by attackers, referred to as \u201cherdsmen\u201d, in 2019 as she made to escape what looked like a robbery-cum-kidnapping operation. The sentencing will not lessen the pain but there is a feeling of justice being served. In 2017, seven people were sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping Chief Olu Falae. I commend the Ondo state government for bringing these criminals to justice \u2014 as it should be \u2014 instead of lamenting and crying conspiracy all the time. Progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNO WOMAN NO FLAG\n\nOf all the presidential flagbearers that have been elected so far, none is a woman. I am assuming I have seen the full list. This is a collective embarrassment at a time the world is promoting gender equity. Unfortunately, there are nil chances that the major parties will pick women as running mates, so we are not even talking of a mitigation here. It is only in Adamawa state that a major party will field a female governorship candidate but that is better than zero. I am not too enthusiastic about the possibility of a preponderance of women as deputy governorship candidates. Let\u2019s just say that Nigerian political powers are yet to get the memo on gender promotion in politics. Shame.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAPC CIRCUS\n\nYou cannot but be bewildered by some happenings in the All Progressives Congress (APC).

Meanwhile, it has emerged that APC may not field a governorship candidate in Akwa Ibom following a factional crisis \u2014 a repetition of what happened in Zamfara and Rivers in 2019. Disorganised.\n\nDIRECT AND INDIRECT\n\nI have read a number of comments asking that indirect primaries should be scrapped in favour of direct primaries because of the influence of money.

Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

With Karny, a bookkeeping app it acquired last year in August, Chari has now made and announced 3 successful acquisitions in 10 months.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThe secret of a successful expansion is to build a local team that masters local market dynamics,\u201d said Chari\u2019s CEO Ismail Belkhayat who co-founded the startup with his wife Sophia Alj (COO) in 2020. \u201cThe real challenge is to convince local entrepreneurs to join forces with Chari to grow faster.\u201d\n\nLast year, in an interview, Belkhayat told TechCabal that the goal is to be the market leader across francophone Africa. Today it makes its first major foray and vouches to \u201ccontinue to surround ourselves with young and ambitious entrepreneurs from francophone Africa to build together a pan-African giant of FMCG and financial services distribution.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2021 by Ali Ouattara and Amidou Diarra, two former managers at Glovo and PepsiCo, Diago operates exclusively in Abidjan, the capital city of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and one of the biggest French-speaking cities in Africa.\n\nChari said in a statement that Ouattara and Diarra, who had initially sought funding and market and tech advisory before choosing to exit to the Moroccan, will remain CEO and COO, respectively. The duo will oversee local business growth before expanding footprint to other Sub-Saharan countries\u2014Chari\u2019s overarching goal.\n\n\u201cDiago\u2019s entire team will receive Chari\u2019s full support functions,\u201d said Chari\u2019s VP of international expansion Cyrille Jacques. \u201cChari\u2019s Casablanca back office will help the Diago team in setting up operations, IT tools, and customer service.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a new trend of African startups getting into both local and international mergers and acquisitions (M&A), especially cross-regional deals. Just last month, a Nigerian autotech startup Autochek travelled up north to acquire Moroccan KIFAL Auto. Now, Chari is acquiring a West African startup.\n\nBelkhayat said the company is currently raising a big series A. If Belkhayat\u2019s 2-year-old startup, with just about $7 million funding, has already made 3 acquisitions and is operational in 3 countries\u2014Morocco, Tunisia, and now Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2014who knows what he\u2019d do with the \u201cbig series A\u201d when it finally closes?\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Boomplay, a Chinese-owned music streaming platform for African artists and songs, has launched in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nToday, the platform opened the doors of its Ivorian offices in Abidjan to enhance music streaming, and help Ivorian artists reach a broader audience within and outside the continent.\n\nCote D\u2019Ivoire marks the 6th African country with Boomplay\u2019s presence after Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana and Cameroon.\n\nSpeaking about the launch, Boomplay C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire General Manager, Paola Audrey Ndengue, said, \u201cWe\u2019re particularly proud to establish a presence in Abidjan, a creative and cultural hub in the region. The warm welcome our team has received from artists, local partners and stakeholders is a strong indicator for us moving forward. Boomplay is committed to contributing to the dynamism of the Ivorian music industry\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no available data on the growth of the Ivory Coast\u2019s music streaming industry, several of its artists have risen to prominence in the past few years due to an increase in streaming services. For example, French singer-songwriter Kikimoteleba rose in Spotify\u2019s ranks when his hit single Tigini exceeded 15 million streams. Others have also been thrust into the spotlight on social media; the Nigerian remix of Aboutou Roots La Blessure, for instance, have been used in thousands of videos across the internet.\n\nThe role these streaming services play in democratising income for Ivorian artists cannot be understated especially as many artists depend of live performances for their income. Guy-Constant Neza, an Ivorian label manager at Believe Digital told Lemonde that 80% of Ivorian artists\u2019 income comes from live performances. Streaming platforms, according to Neza, provide \u201ca double awareness among our artists, of both the limits of the existing model and the opportunities that streaming offers.\u201d\n\nWith the launch of Boomplay, Ivorian artists now have access to 70 million active users on a platform where they\u2019ll be paid per stream/purchase.\n\nThe company has a freemium model similar to YouTube where users can play music for free but with ad intermissions, or pay for an ad-free version.\n\nAccording to Director of Artist and Media Relations, Tosin Sorinola, \u201cThis physical presence extends Boomplay\u2019s mission to promote local talent by providing them with a platform and resources within and outside of the service, which enables them to reach a wider audience of music lovers across the continent. We are delighted to provide a transparent service which ensures that artists get due revenue from their music streaming.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "ALL manners of experts have filled media spaces with their laudatory tales of how former Vice President Abubakar Atiku, and the former Governor of Lagos State Jagaban Borgu Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu won the tickets of their respective parties. Words have been thrown around to justify these victories that query the Nigerian\u2019s appreciation of the past and cast doubt about any importance we attach to the future.\n\nThey have no qualms in ascribing the victories to \u201cstrategy, sagacity, critical thinking, networking, and political savoir faire\u201d. These words have meanings.\n\nA communal meaning of these words could not have associated them with how these bazaars dubbed primaries were conducted. What is the sagacity in out-spending others? What strategy prides itself in buying delegates? Does political savoir faire negate the basic fairness and justness these contests entail?\n\nWhat are the duo promising Nigerians? How do they intend to recoup their expenses from an over-burdened economy that is under threats from insecurity, debts, corruption, and the philosophy that governments are self-serving? Should their expenditure on the primaries not be a concern?\n\nThere are other issues. Some would mention their age, health, as possible hindrances to what they intend to do to improve Nigeria. We are in such dire straits though most Nigerians believe anyone would be better than Buhari.\n\nAtiku and Tinubu deserve their victories. Nigeria does not deserve them. They know it but their life ambition of ruling Nigeria is more important than the survival of Nigeria. Nothing counts. If they don\u2019t become President they will keep running until they win.\n\nSo said Tinubu when he pledged to work with whoever won in the All Progressives Congress, APC. Atiku started running for the presidency in 1992 under the Social Democratic Party, SDP. He has been in every presidential race since 2007.\n\nTheir political sagacity got Nigeria into the nightmare administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. They have offered no apologies for the damage their support for Buhari, an extension of their ambitions, has done to Nigeria.\n\nSometimes you think they were oblivious of Buhari\u2019s Nigeria and had arrived on a rescue mission. They lured millions of Nigerians into seeing Buhari as the answer whereas his administration has addressed none of the issues on which he stood to sell his worthiness as President. Are we celebrating rewarding them for procuring the hardships of the past seven years? We still complain about how challenging Nigeria has become in those years.\n\nWhen some Nigerians talk you would think they are under a spell. How can we behave as if we are having parties for a duo who invented Nigeria\u2019s paradise? What is wrong with us as a people?\n\nTalks now centre on their competence, courage, experience, patriotism, and steadfastness. Assuming for a moment that these are values, how have they used them for Nigeria? Will they suddenly change from politics of self?\n\nAlternatives are available. We have to explore them. Nothing says that their reward for hardships that they visited on us is to award them rights to dispense more hardships. They must know that we have not forgotten.\n\nSuccesses and their fall outs impress us. We are not ready to subject the results to any meaning interrogation. It should challenge whatever is left of us as a people that Atiku and Tinubu are our best \u2013 with all they have done, all they have refused to do, and a lot more they will do for themselves.\n\nTheir priorities if elected would be to recover their investments with interests while Nigeria wallows in the accelerating consequences of their decision to gift the country to Buhari for eight years.\n\nFinally\u2026\n\nNOW that the primary is over would the government attend to the secondary matter of the universities on strike? The ASUU strike has for months beclouded the future of the leaders of tomorrow. Government has no sustained interest on whether the universities are open or closed.\n\nRead also: Atiku, Tinubu unveil economic agenda\n\nPONZI schemes are back in fuller force under more guises. People should be careful with those mouth-watering investments that offer to double your investment within an hour.\n\nIT was deliberate mischief to publish that passengers kidnapped in the Abuja-Kaduna train attack in March had been released. They are still held.\n\nDOES anyone know the reason for the attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo? Is it enough to name a group as responsible?\n\nLAW and order have so degenerated that motorcycle riders readily fight security agencies trying to implement a government policy. We have really lost a lot of control.\n\nWAS an official statement made on the attacks on some people who wanted to register in Lagos for the voter\u2019s card? They were attacked because of their origins. The attacks have more damaging meaning for our fragile unity. Government should act, and decisively too.\n\n.Isiguzo is a major commentator on minor issues",

          "text": "Despite the outcome of the results of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Primary, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has declared that he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nOsinbajo speaking when he hosted members of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed the Vice President for the presidency, said the outcome notwithstanding, he will support the winner and flagbearer of the APC for the 2023 presidential elections, Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\n\u201cWe went to the convention, and the results showed us clearly that we lost, but it is only a battle, it is not the war. There are battles ahead, but we will win the war for a new Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that we will win that war for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat is why our movement for a new Nigeria must remain strong and firm. And we will do everything to keep our movement strong and solid.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President who came third at the election, stated that he is committed and will remain committed to that dream (of a new Nigeria).\n\n\u201cA new Nigeria has only just started, and everywhere across this land, it will be clear to all that a new Nigeria has been born. Once the genie comes out of the bottle, you cannot put it back. The word has been spoken; it cannot be taken back: it is time for a New Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President pledged his support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\nOsinbajo recalled the personal letter he wrote to Asiwaju yesterday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\nRead also: Goodluck Jonathan congratulates Atiku, Tinubu, others\n\n\u201cIn that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\nHe thanked Nigerians at home and abroad, including the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 groups, for the overwhelming support for his presidential bid, adding that \u201cwhen we started this race, I never believed that we would have so many young men and women who would believe so passionately in the cause of a new Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201c Everybody said, oh, everyone has lost hope, there is no future, we are all tired, we are in despair. But when you came out in your numbers across the country \u2013 the volunteers\u2019 movement, the progressive union, the women\u2019s movement, all across the country, saying the same thing, I knew that it was time. And you made it clear to everyone that indeed it is time for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd we went everywhere to the 36 States of this country and Abuja and we spoke to the elected delegates of our great party the APC, they shared their fears with us, they told us about their dreams of the future, everyone wants a new Nigeria where young people have jobs, we all want a Nigeria that is safe and secure, a Nigeria where there is a future, where people can dream of a real future.\n\n\u201cAs I said at the convention, I went to school here, I was born here, my parents were born here. Every opportunity I have had was given to me by this country. \u201cAnd it is possible for this country to provide the same opportunity for you and all the future generations. But we must fight for it. In every fight, you lose some battles.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, some leaders of Osinbajo Support groups, Ahmed Badanga described the Osinbajo as \u201ca role model to all of us. You are the Obama of Africa. You have made us proud and we will continue to remain with you.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cyes, we are progressives and we need to move forward. I will urge all of us to remain steadfast and committed to this cause because we have a bright future ahead of us.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a leader of the Coalition of Women for Osinbajo, Rabbi Dauda, declared the the Vice President as a \u2018winner forever.\u2019\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we, the women of Nigeria, find it worthy to stand by you. Somehow, you are not the flagbearer today, but you will be the flagbearer tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI want to say to you that this is a continuous process, we will be waiting for you. We are here today to listen to you, to tell us where to go and what to do, and I tell you, we will all be waiting for you, tomorrow and always. Anytime you need us, all you need to do is to call on us and we shall be there for you.\u201d\n\nAlso, another leader of a PYO Support group, Diana Mary said, \u201cYour Excellency, you have led us to win, we are winners. We are not taking this for granted, you have led a direction that we will continue to follow and we are happy that for the sake of Nigeria you answered the call.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal that we still converge and speak about those things that we need to address so that we can pull a stronger force for Nigeria. This generation of Nigerians is looking for that force that will fight for their future. Your Excellency, whenever you are alone and you think that it is a low moment, I want you to think of the numerous and thousands of us who are behind you and believe in your audacity, drive, and tenacity. You are the star that we know.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President was accompanied on the visit to the Campaign Office by former Kano State Governor and the Senator representing Kano South in the National Assembly, Kabiru Gaya; Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Babafemi Ojudu; among other senior government officials.",

          "text": "A judge in the US has dismissed a rape lawsuit claim from a Nevada woman against Cristiano Ronaldo, football star, in Las Vegas.\n\nKathryn Mayorga was bidding for the Manchester United footballer to pay her millions of dollars more than the \u00a3305k ($375k) in a confidentiality agreement she received after she claimed that he raped her in Las Vegas in 2009 \u2013 an allegation which Ronaldo has always denied.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey dismissed the court on Friday and claimed that Mayorga\u2019s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, had shown \u201cbad-faith conduct\u201d and the use of \u201cpurloined\u201d confidential documents that the judge said tainted the case beyond redemption.\n\nDorsey gave a 42-page order which dismissed the case outright with no option to file it again is a severe sanction, while adding that Ronaldo had been harmed by Stovall\u2019s conduct, Mirror reported.\n\nThe ruling said: \u201cI find that the procurement and continued use of these documents was bad faith, and simply disqualifying Stovall will not cure the prejudice to Ronaldo because the misappropriated documents and their confidential contents have been woven into the very fabric of (plaintiff Kathryn) Mayorga\u2019s claims.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cHarsh sanctions are merited.\u201d\n\nStovall could appeal the decision to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The Associated Press report on Saturday that they have not responded to phone calls or text messages, to associate Larissa Drohobyczer, on the subject.\n\nMayorga has claimed that she was assaulted by Ronaldo at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009 but the footballer has denied the allegation against him.\n\nMayorga gave consent through Stovall and Drohobyczer for her name to be used publicly during the trial.\n\nIn 2019, US prosecutors said Ronaldo would not face any charges, nine years after Mayorga reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with the Portuguese player.\n\nMs Mayorga had sought to re-open the case in 2018 with her lawyer claiming that she had taken motivation from the #MeToo movement against sexual violence.\n\nRonaldo is alleged to have raped Mayorga, an American woman, during a holiday to Las Vegas in the summer of 2009, just weeks before his move from United to Real Madrid. An allegation he has always denied.\n\nOn June 12, 2009, Ronaldo met Mayorga at the now-closed nightclub Rain, and they were pictured by paparazzi on that evening.\n\nMayorga has alleged that she was invited back to Ronaldo\u2019s suite at the Palms Place Hotel, where it is alleged that the rape took place.\n\nA day later, on June 13, 2009, Mayorga reported the alleged rape to police but opted against revealing her name or the name of her alleged attacker, or where the incident had taken place.\n\nAfter hiring a lawyer Mayorga initiated civil proceedings against Ronaldo.\n\nThe allegation reached the public domain as a result of being reported by German newspaper Der Spiegel in 2017, as a result of their Football Leaks expos\u00e9, with documents revealing details of the case.\n\nA document from the leaks alleges Ronaldo said \u201cshe said no and stop several times\u201d during sex. He is also said to have apologised afterwards. His legal team have said the document was \u201ccompletely fabricated\u201d.\n\nIn September 2018, the player released a statement to publicly refute the allegations: \u201cI firmly deny the accusations being issued against me.\n\n\u201cRape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense.\u201d (Mirror",

Yes, things are not what they should be but you as youths, individually and collectively, must make up your mind, make contributions in order to make things the way they should be.\n\n\u201cIf you leave things to those who are messing it up for you and who are saying you are the leaders of tomorrow, you will never have that tomorrow. Today is your day.\n\n\u201cThen the third point is; yes, sometime you may get people who would help you and a times you may not even get who would help you; you must remember God has given you innate ability to be what He wants you to be and if you make up your mind on what you want to be, God will help you and He will provide those people who would help you to reach the sky which should be your limit,\u201d the former president said.\n\nObasanjo charged those in charge of the project to monitor the progress of the beneficiaries, citing the popular Biblical parable of stewards, who were given talents by their master.\n\nHe charged the youths that it is not the opportunities that was given to them that matter, but what use to put the opportunities into.\n\nIn her own remarks, the chairperson of the Centre, Dr. Bisi Kolapo, implored the youth to emulate Obasanjo\u2019s passion and commitment in an effort to build \u201cNigeria of our dreams\u201d.\n\nKolapo also warned them against corruption and greed, saying it would be difficult to fight those menaces if they are culprit.\n\nShe harped on courage, fortitude, forthrightness, respectability, knowledge, loyalty, passion and responsibility as some of the virtues expected of the youths in order to move the country forward.\n\nResponding, two of the beneficiaries, Bashir Ali Modu and Asembe Ngumimi, from Borno and Benue States respectively, commended the centre for the donation, which they said would enhance growth and development of their trades.\n\nThey also promised to make judicious use of the tricycles given them, just as they urged other wealthy Nigerians to take a cue from the gesture in order to lift young entrepreneurs across the country.",

The Governor has hardly been in office.\n\n\u201cIt was the Governor that declared the ban on motorbikes but he is not on the ground to monitor the daily crisis occasioned by the declaration, though commendable but needs careful enforcement.\n\n\u201cThe rainy season in Lagos is always a bitter experience for Lagosians in flooding, heavy traffic and other casualties, but the Governor has not been on his seat to address issues related to this. Crime has been on the increase in Lagos lately.\n\n\u201cNo doubt state resources will be involved in these campaign activities and most government officials will cash in on the absence of the Governor to also abandon their responsibilities, either to pursue their political other business interests.\n\n\u201cThere are many more grave consequences attendant upon the decision of the Governor to abdicate his constitutional responsibilities in pursuit of the political ambition of the APC presidential flag bearer.\n\n\u201cFrom all the foregoing, I do hereby appeal to Governor Sanwoolu to return to Lagos and assume his constitutional responsibilities of functional governance.

I\u2019m very disappointed, because of that one missed chance,\u201d Hofmann told RTL.\n\nThe Magyars squandered their own gilt-edged chance soon after when substitute Martin Adam, well-placed in the area, headed a Dominik Szoboszlai cross straight at Neuer.\n\nAnother home sub Daniel Gazdag then warmed Neuer\u2019s gloves with a rasping effort from the edge of the box ten minutes from the end.\n\nGermany will play their final match of the June international break at home against Italy on Tuesday before the group campaign concludes in September.\n\n\u201cWe have to see that we learn the lessons from this game,\u201d said Flick, with an eye on the World Cup in Qatar in five months\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cWe have always said that we are developing. We are in a process aimed towards the World Cup. Against Italy, we want to really get things going again,\u201d said Neuer.\n\nAlso on Tuesday Hungary, who remain in second place in Group A3 behind leaders Italy with four points, visit last-placed England in Wolverhampton.",

Boy and Danjuma Sa\u2019idu.\n\nAlthough Mamu did not give details of how the 11 victims were released, sources said, some of them were freed based on health grounds while others were freed as part of the agreement reached with the terrorists.\n\nMamu said Sheikh Gumi who worked behind the scene made the release possible.\n\nHe was quoted in the Desert Herald newspaper as saying, \u201cbehind the scene, Sheikh Gumi by Allah\u2019s will, made it possible. \u201cHe was involved from the day I started. In fact, I accepted that role (negotiator), because of his directives to that effect.\n\n\u201cEven the final arrangement of how and the safest place to get the victims was arranged and coordinated by him,\u201d the Desert Herald quoted him.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, it was initially expected that all the abducted women will be released in the first batch while negotiations for the release of the remaining victims will continue.\n\nBut terrorists were said to have cut down the number of women initially slated for release because the federal government demanded that those with life threatening injuries/illnesses should be included.\n\nWhen contacted, chairman of relations of the abducted victims, Dr. Abdulfatai Jimoh, said he just read the report and was expecting official confirmation from the government.\n\nHe however, confirmed that Mamu had been involved in the negotiations of the release of the victims.\n\n\u201cI just read the report, we have not heard any official information from the government yet\u201d, Jimoh said.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked an Abuja-Kaduna bound passenger train, killing eight people and abducting 63 others. Many others were wounded.\n\nOne of the abducted victims was released few days after a ransom of N100 million was paid.\n\nThe victims had been in captivity for 75 days.

          "text": "The United States late Friday rescinded a 17-month-old requirement that people arriving in the country by air test negative for COVID-19, a move that follows intense lobbying by airlines and the travel industry.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky issued a four-page order lifting the mandate, effective at 12:01 a.m. ET (0400 GMT) Sunday, saying it is \u201cnot currently necessary.\u201d\n\nThe requirement had been one of the last major U.S. COVID-19 travel requirements. Its end comes as the summer travel season kicks off, and airlines were already preparing for record demand. Airlines have said that many Americans have not been not traveling internationally because of concerns they will test positive and be stranded abroad.\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said the CDC decision is based on science and available data, and said the agency \u201cwill not hesitate to reinstate a pre-departure testing requirement, if needed later.\u201d\n\nThe CDC will reassess the decision in 90 days, an administration official said.\n\nThe United States has required incoming international air travelers to provide pre-departure negative tests since January 2021. In December the CDC tightened the rule to require travelers to test negative within one day before flights to the United States rather than three days.\n\nThe CDC has not required testing for land border crossings.\n\nMany countries in Europe and elsewhere have already dropped testing requirements.\n\nThe CDC is still requiring most non-U.S. citizens to be vaccinated against COVID to travel to the United States.\n\nTwo officials told Reuters the Biden administration had considered lifting the testing rule only for vaccinated travelers.\n\nJetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) Chief Executive Robin Hayes told Reuters on Friday that the testing requirement was \u201cthe last obstacle to a really full international travel recovery,\u201d saying that it \u201cserved no purpose anymore.\u201d\n\nIATA, the world\u2019s biggest airline trade group, said it was \u201cgreat news\u201d that the administration is \u201cremoving the ineffective pre-departure COVID test for travel to the US.\u201d\n\nIn April, a federal judge declared the CDC\u2019s requirements that travelers wear masks on airplanes and in transit hubs like airports unlawful and the Biden administration stopped enforcing it. The Justice Department has appealed the order, but no decision is likely before fall at the earliest.\n\nThe CDC continues to recommend travelers wear masks and get COVID-19 tests before and after international flights.\n\nRaymond James said in a research note that lifting the restrictions \u201cis an important catalyst for international travel.\u201d\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL.N) Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters last week that dropping the requirements will boost travel, noting that 44 of 50 countries Delta serves do not require testing.\n\nU.S. Travel Association CEO Roger Dow said Friday\u2019s move will \u201caccelerate the recovery of the U.S. travel industry,\u201d which was hard hit by the pandemic.\n\nReuters",

Yes, things are not what they should be but you, as youths, individually and collectively, must make up your mind, make contributions in order to make things the way they should be.\n\n\u201cIf you leave things to those who are messing it up for you and who are saying you are the leaders of tomorrow, you will never have that tomorrow. Today is your day.\n\n\u201cThen the third point is; yes, sometime you may get people who would help you and a times you may not even get who would help you; you must remember God has given you innate ability to be what He wants you to be and if you make up your mind on what you want to be, God will help you and He would provide those people who would help you to reach the sky which should be your limit.\u201d\n\nThe Chairperson of the Centre, Dr Bisi Kolapo implored the youth to emulate Obasanjo\u2019s passion and commitment in an effort to build \u201cNigeria of our dreams.\u201d\n\nKolapo also warned them against corruption and greed, saying it would be difficult to fight those menaces if you\u2019re a culprit.\n\nShe harped on courage, fortitude, forthrightness, respectability, knowledge, loyalty, passion and responsibility as some of the virtues expected of the youths in order to move the country forward.\n\nResponding, two of the beneficiaries, Bashir Alimodu and Asembe Ngumimi, respectively from Borno and Benue States, applauded the centre for the donation, which they said would enhance growth and development of their trades.\n\nThey also promised to make judicious use of the tricycles, just as they urged other wealthy Nigerians to take a clue from the gesture in order to lift young entrepreneurs across the country.",
