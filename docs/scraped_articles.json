          "text": "\u2026 Obaseki, Shaibu can\u2019t win against PDP, Wike\n\nKassim Afegbua, a former campaign spokesman for ex-Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has disclosed that the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, and his Deputy, Philip Shaibu, cannot win against the Peoples Democratic Party and Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in the ongoing verbal war occasioned by an intra-party crisis.\n\nThis is as he also alleged that Obaseki had been in the habit of manipulating Shaibu and \u201cmaking him (Shaibu) the fall-guy of a system that has been heavily compromised.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH reports that both governors had been engaging in verbal war, with Wike and Obaseki going after each other jugular.\n\nWhile Wike said he was not in the same class as his Edo counterpart when it comes to party politics, Obaseki warned Wike not to cause disruption in PDP, adding that the party is not (Wike) personal property.\n\nBut Afegbua, a former PDP member in the state, said he was in \u201cdoubt if they (Obaseki and Shaibu) will live to enjoy the spoil of their new agitation.\u201d\n\nGiving insight into the protracted party crisis in an article titled, \u2018Wike and political asylum seekers in Edo (1)\u2019, Afegbu blamed Obaseki and his deputy for the ongoing verbal war.\n\nAccording to him, Wike\u2019s position is predicated on the new arrogance of power that has become the second nature of the Edo first two citizens.\n\nThe article read in part, \u201cFor being an insider to all processes that threw up Governor Obaseki and his Deputy, Governor Wike knows exactly what he was talking about. And the solution to all these is the 9-lettered word; gratitude.\n\n\u201cJust show appreciation and gratitude\u2026 Otherwise, the present political impasse in the state will continue its macabre dance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Obaseki and his co-travellers often behave like political asylum seekers. As migrants who were helped to cross the border, they got into the asylum camp, participated in the internal politics of the camp, and got familiar with it. Having been given residency, they now want to undo the real citizens of the country.\n\n\u201cIn fact, they are telling the real citizens that though they are migrants, but that the other integrative laws apply to them. And that if the host country refuses to accord them the leadership, they are ready to tear down the walls, flag, and other insignia that the country holds dear. I doubt if they will live to enjoy the spoil of their new agitation.\u201d\n\nAfegbua, who was an aide to a former governor of Edo state and ex-National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, also accused Obaseki of manipulating his deputy.\n\n\u201cWhat Governor Obaseki cannot say, he pushes his pliant Deputy to vomit, making him the fall-guy of a system that has been heavily compromised in terms of failed promises and empty rhetorics.\n\n\u201cObaseki\u2019s Deputy, Phillip Shuaibu, often wants to be seen as fearless, outspoken, and more political than his boss.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "You lack capacity, hand over, let Osinbajo rescue Nigeria, Ortom tells Buhari",
          "text": "Governor Samuel Ortom\n\nBy Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, saying from all indications, the president lacks the capacity to rescue the country from the worsening economic and security predicaments confronting the nation.\n\nThe Governor who spoke yesterday during an interaction with newsmen in Makurdi, among others, said \u201cSince the inception of our country Nigerian even before the independence we have never witnessed this kind of nepotism that is going on in our country. We have never witnessed this level of disunity in our country. We have never seen this level of insecurity and we have never seen this kind of economic downturn the way we have it today.\n\n\u201cI am a grassroots person, so I appreciate the feelings of the people out there. I feel so sad and I also pity the President of our country because those surrounding him are deceiving him and he is not aware of the plight of our people. The basic responsibility of any government we were told is the provision of security for lives and property. The level of insecurity in the country today is worrisome.\n\n\u201cThose people who are complacent and living in their comfort zones without looking at the reality of what is happening in our country today should have a rethink. It is really unfortunate that I have over 1.5million IDPs in Benue state out of the projected seven million population that I have in Benue, and more than 80 per cent of the IDPs are farmers that earned us the appellation of the food basket of the nation.\u201dToday they are in IDPs camps suffering. As if that is not enough, everyday you wake up to the news that Fulanis with the consent of the federal government have decided to make life unbearable for my people in Benue State.\n\n\u201cHow can we allow our country go on with this level of impunity by the APC led Federal Government? How can they allow these Fulani herdsmen to come and murder, kill and rape our women and children? So, the Federal Government has completely failed and I want to call on our President, Muhammadu Buhari to accept the fact that he has failed this country and I want to advise him to honourably resign as President of Nigerian.\n\nALSO READ: 2023 Presidential convention: Why PDP may settle for Wike, Mohammed, others\n\n\u201cHe can resign and hand over to his Vice to handle the affairs of this country otherwise this country is going down. No wonder in 2014 I saw a video clip where the President promised Nigerians that his APC government was going to take Nigeria from the top to bottom.\u201dAnd today if nothing is done, if the president does not rise up to the responsibility of taking this country out of the bottom to the top, we are going underneath.\n\n\u201cThose who are keeping quiet should continue, but I have said my beat. They can insult me and also send the EFCC after me and declare all the things we do right as wrong. But I have nothing to hide, if you come after me I will approach the courts because I have nothing to hide.\n\n\u201cI will always stand for truth, equity, fairness and justice and that is all. This country belongs to all of us. It is not about a Fulani President or President Buhari. We have had Fulani presidents who I adjudged as the best we have ever had. We had President Shagari, a Fulani man from the caliphate.\n\n\u201cHe was a good leader. He provided security for lives and property. We had President Yar\u2019adua a Fulani man from Katsina state. He did very well and till tomorrow nobody has provided the solution to the Niger Delta crisis more than President Yar\u2019adua a Fulani man.\n\n\u201cThe issue today is about incompetence, it is about non-performance, it is about barefooted leadership, it is about lame-duck, it is about somebody without a vision and direction to lead our country.\n\n\u201cSo I call on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign. If he wants APC to continue he should hand over to his Vice to take up from there. Anybody who is deceiving President Buhari telling him that he has performed well is a liar.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Military winning war against insurgency, insecurity\n\nHope will triumph fear in 2023 polls\n\nChief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, in this interview rules out military coup in Nigeria, saying the tendencies that precipitate coups in some African countries do not exist in Nigeria. He also spoke on how the military is winning the war against insurgency and insecurity in the country.\n\nHow have the strategies used to fight terrorism in Nigeria evolved?\n\nSome of our tactics have changed but our vision remains the same \u2013 We want to bring an end to beginning of all terrorism. We are achieving these in collaboration with stakeholders in national security and defence.\n\nGlobally, terrorism has evolved in the last two decades. The case is not different in Nigeria. What we are doing differently is to be ahead of this evolving trend. The Armed Forces of Nigeria is more prepared for all scenarios.\n\nUnfortunately, it will do us more harm than good if we go public to reveal all we have done or what we have stopped doing or will do. The good news is that in all scenarios, Nigeria will win.\n\nLet us never forget the words of Winston Churchill, \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d\n\nSince the war against Boko Haram / ISWAP started, the military has lost some major battles in the North East. What is being done to avoid future defeats?\n\nA better way to look at it is that in the last 20 years, the military has won major battles in the North-East.\n\nWe have won most of our battles and that is why we are winning the war. This not just an opinion, it is the fact. The most recent evidence from the Global Terrorism Report confirms this.\n\nA war is made up of several battles. In a perfect world, you plan to win everything but perfection never happens in war. Sometimes the way forward is backward. Sometimes you lose a battle to win the war.\n\nThere has been a recent wave of military takeovers in Africa? Is the military approach a remedy to poor governance?\n\nFirst, let me make it clear that the probability of non-democratic leadership in Nigeria is zero.\n\nRather than go back to our past, we have learnt from it. It is no longer an option. We are passing this message down the ladder.\n\nLike Nigeria is doing, other African countries must strengthen their democratic processes rather than subvert it.\n\nOur findings reveal that one main reason for these negative events is when a leader overstays and loses focus. This causes government institutions to weaken and eventually the non-democratic take over.\n\nSome security stakeholders believe that the final stage of the war against terrorism will be faster if the country hires foreign fighters (mercenaries)\n\nWhere lays the loyalty of the foreign fighter, to Nigeria or self?\n\nThe men and women of the Armed Forces fight to protect Nigeria NOT because they are paid to do it. It is because they, we see it as a duty.\n\nCertainly, we will continue to collaborate with other global powers and defense institutions, but we are not going to outsource our primary responsibility.\n\nWhat is the military leadership doing with respect to complaints from some officers about injustice and unfair disciplinary procedures?\n\nThere is a lot of misinformation and disinformation about the administrative codes and procedures of the Armed Forces.\n\nLike our global partners, the military does not operate with court orders. A court martial is different from a civil court. The military has means to maintain discipline and order.\n\nHow much support is the military getting from civil society, non-governmental organizations; especially on the non-kinetic approach to rebuilding peace?\n\nJust as nobody can use only one finger to write, the Armed Forces of Nigeria cannot write all the wrongs in security by itself.\n\nThere is a lot of work that some of these organizations have put in especially to protect women and children in the North East. A lot more still needs to be done on the non-kinetic approach to achieving peace.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that with respect to land area (size), the North East region is larger than the South-East, South-South and South West regions combined.\n\nThe terrain is difficult for most organizations. Many have provided support to communities in sectors such as health, education, construction and agriculture.\n\nWe are also making sure that resettlement is being done at places that are certified as safe.\n\nWhat we need is for more citizens to join the building of a better, safe and prosperous nation.\n\nIs there a rising concern of child soldiers in Nigeria?\n\nThat children have been exposed to violence does not mean they are terrorists. In the last six months, we have witnessed thousands of adult men and women surrender to our troops.\n\nYes, some of these children are as young as 12 years old and have been trained on weapon handling.\n\nFor us, these children need to be given better parenting; knowledge and wisdom to make them grow to be responsible adults.\n\nThere is a need for moral and social re-development to rebuild their character.\n\nIt is less than a year to the national elections. Will the military be playing an expanded role?\n\nThe question is why should it be necessary for the military to go beyond its constitutional role?\n\nThe Armed Forces will continue to uphold the constitution and keep improving the state of peace in Nigeria.\n\nWe are going to keep our role simple-give support to the electoral body when we are requested to. Citizens would be given an environment to make them vote for their candidate of choice without fear. I guarantee you that hope will trump fear in 2023.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Abdulmumin Murtala, Kano\n\nThe Shari\u2019a Police in Kano and other northern states, otherwise called Hisbah, have been called upon to rise against insecurity by ideologically confronting kidnappers, bandits and terrorists in the region who are abusing the image of Islam and Muslims by their acts.\n\nThe call was made by the popular human rights activist and politician, Shehu Sani in Kano on Monday when he paid a familiarization visit to the Kano state Hisbah.\n\nShehu Sani argued that it is the duty of Hisbah to protect the image of Islam and Muslims in the region being abused by the bandits and terrorists who are killing innocent people in the name of religion.\n\n\u201cThe message I have given them is that the most important and sensitive issue today as a country is the problem of banditry and terrorism and as the religious police, they have a duty to unite and see how they can combat banditry and terrorism in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTerrorists have been destroying the image of Islam and using the name of Islam to destroy the image of Muslims. There is a need for Hisbah to organize themselves and ideologically confront terrorists and bandits, this is very important.\n\n\u201cThe need for them to be mobilizing people to rise against banditry and terrorism in the northern part of Nigeria is also very important.\n\n\u201cThe need for them to reach out to rural communities and educate our citizens on the need for them not to join bandits and terrorists is also very important. So apart from them to be enforcing religious laws, there is need for them at this hour to be very more present, active and agile in finding a lasting solution to the problem of bandits and terrorists that have been kidnapping and killing our people\u201d Shehu Sani said.\n\nOn what the Hisbah told him during the visit, he explained that he was there for the visit to clarify complaints he received about the activities of Hisbah.\n\n\u201cFirst of all many things have been said about Hisbah, so I said as a former Senator and as a Human rights activist I should visit their office to hear from them, what are their duties and responsibilities and LSO issues that have been attributed to them.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I am happy to hear that they have not prohibited those who decide to keep afro hairstyle like me. That one has been cleared because I am here to defend the right of people to keep their hair.\n\n\u201cSecondly they have told me in practical terms that they are against the manufacture, consumption and distribution of alcohol in this state as well as drug abuse. Thirdly they told me that they have a dress code which if you violate you have violated the law of Hisbah. They told me about manqu\u00e9 that if you can remove the head of it, you can put it in your store to display your product.\n\n\u201cLastly they told me about the types of movies which they allow or disallow as a way of preserving public morality. At least these are some of the things they talked to me about\u201d he stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Kaduna State Government says it will allocate another land to Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, at Kangimi village following disagreement over alleged encroachment by the ABU College of Agriculture and Animal Science in the Mando area of the metropolis.\n\nIsmail Umaru Dikko, the Director-General, Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Authority (KASUPDA), while briefing newsmen in Kaduna, explained, \u201cIt is strange that people who are supposedly out to protect institutional land will not exercise any curiosity regarding the unauthorized excisions that have occurred on the land or demand that their institution investigate how it happened.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Director-General, till date, most of G-Item 1060 remains unutilised, saying that the entire area was a forest when the land was allocated in 1965, but now, it is a veritable part of Kaduna metropolis.\n\nHe added that the entire area is being replanned in line with the reviewed Kaduna Master Plan Law, 2016 and the Urban Renewal Programme.\n\nDikko explained that the replanning would preserve the college, its academic facilities, hostels, and staff housing on the current site, stressing that with a revised land allocation that more appropriately reflects its actual ability to use the land.\n\nHe stated that the college would also be allocated land for agriculture in the Kangimi area earmarked for such endeavours in the Kaduna Masterplan.\n\nHe said that the G-Item 1060, measuring 338 hectares, was allocated to Northern Veterinary Experimental Station in 1965, saying that the College of Agriculture and Animal Science, which succeeded the Northern Veterinary Experimental Station on the land, has developed 47 hectares which are being used for educational purposes and staff housing.\n\nHe added that the college is using another 34.5 hectares for agriculture, a significant part of the land, representing 24% of the entire G-Item 1060, saying that it has been illegally subdivided and sold.\n\nThe Director-General observed that consequent to this unlawful subdivision and excisions, about 900 plots have been illegally laid out on the land, with 426 plots either fully developed or at various stages of construction.\n\nHe explained that plots of land within the College Administrative and Staff Housing Area have also been sold, and private facilities such as an Event Centre, a Petrol Station and Private Residential Houses have been developed therein.\n\nHe further explained that the unlawful subdivisions, excisions and sales of plots were done without the consent or approval of the Kaduna State Government, pointing out that the actions constitute an unapproved change of land use and unacceptable violation of the purpose for which the G-Item was originally allocated.\n\nOver the years, he explained that an unfortunate pattern has developed wherein officials of some federal agencies in the state violate the terms of allocation of the land issued to their organizations, stressing that these officials have unlawfully excised public land and reallocated for private purposes.\n\nHe added that the satellite images of the site show that the land allocated extends beyond the fence, and a physical inspection would further confirm this point, explaining that the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria statement tries to shrink G-Item 1060 from its 1965 size in a vain attempt to pretend that the portion illegally excised and subdivided were never part of the original allocation.\n\nDikko stated that this is the first time that KASUPDA has seen an instance where a landowner admits ownership of less than his full allocation, saying that these are the facts of the matter, as a campaign of blackmail by trade unions and management of the institution will neither alter the facts nor confer immunity for violations of the terms of land allocation.\n\nWhile protesting the alleged take over of its land by the state government despite court order restraining the government or its agencies from doing so, the chairman of the ASUU ABU branch, Prof Haruna Jibril, had impressed on the Senate of the ABU to consider withdrawing the degree certificates awarded Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai of Kaduna State as his many actions are in contravention of the requirements in character and learning deemed worthy of Ahmadu Bello University degree award.",

The division is not strictly on a North/South basis.\n\n\u201cFor instance, PDP members in the National Assembly, most of who are southerners, do not want zoning. The majority of these federal lawmakers want an open contest, as some of the aspirants including former Senate President Bukola Saraki.\n\n\u201cIt may also interest you that not all our governors from the South are in support of zoning the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cThe governors are also divided on zoning, just like the BoT, the National Caucus and even the NWC. There is no consensus on the matter for now,\u201d the source, who craved anonymity, said.\n\nHowever, those nursing presidential aspirations have scaled up lobbying and consultations to have the pendulum sway their way.\n\nWhile some of the aspirants have been lobbying to have the ticket zoned to the south, others are pushing for an open contest.\n\nIncidentally, virtually all members of the various party organs are also members of NEC. They will have input in the final decision expected to be taken at the NEC meeting.\n\nSouthern PDP governors had joined forces with their APC counterparts to press for the zoning of the presidential tickets to their region.\n\nThose from the North are arguing that the last PDP presidential candidate, former President Goodluck Jonathan, is from the South and that it is the turn of the North to have the ticket.\n\nThey also argued that by 2023 on the North/South rotation, the North would have done only ten years to the South\u2019s 14 years, thereby making it imperative for a Northerner to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPresidential aspirants from the North include Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President Bukola Saraki.\n\nAspirants from the South include former Senate President Pius Ayim, Chief Sam Ohuanbunwa and foremost journalist Dele Momodu. Also speculated to be interested but yet to declare an interest is Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nSpeaking on a Channels Television Programme on Sunday, Saraki said zoning alone should not determine who should be the party\u2019s candidate. He added that the aspirant\u2019s pedigree and capacity to perform should be considered.",

          "title": "Wike versus Obaseki: Battle of the bruisers",
          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, is a past master at the art of the political insult. He has no use for the elegant putdown; his words are often bruising, brutal, guaranteed to leave a mark. His latest verbal bomb lobbed at his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, ticks the usual boxes.\n\nReacting to his colleague calling him a \u201cbully\u201d for rebuking Deputy Governor, Phillip Shaibu, Wike said: \u201cYou came to beg a bully for you to have a ticket. A bully was your DG Campaign and a bully bullied you into Government House. What a shame. You came back with your wife to thank the bully saying that after God, the bully made it possible for you to be there\u201d.\n\nHe went on to call Obaseki a \u201cserial betrayer,\u201d apologising to former All Progressives Party (APC) National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, who had predicted that his erstwhile political godson would soon turn on his new-found benefactors.\n\nThe two governors have been feuding over the power struggle in the Edo chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which has pitched Obaseki against old warhorses like Chief Dan Orbih and others who controlled the party before the local APC crisis gifted them a governor.\n\nA convention adopted by Nigeria\u2019s two leading political parties makes the governor defacto \u2018leader\u2019 in his domain. In that capacity he has the power to impose and depose. His word becomes law and heaven help the dissidents who would not bow before the emperor.\n\nIn some states, governors have made the pragmatic choice to cohabit and share power with powerful individuals, while casting envious glances at neighbours ruling like lords of the manor. For some, that adjustment became a bridge too far \u2013 leading to nerve-wracking battles with those who helped them climb up the ladder.\n\nThis was case with Obaseki who chafed at attempts by Oshiomhole to exert political control over a successor he personally chose and imposed.\n\nRather than suffer the indignity of an Akinwumi Ambode who was denied the ticket for a second term in office as Lagos State governor and took it with equanimity, he leapt into the \u201cenemy\u2019s\u201d embrace, cutting whatever deal guaranteed him the platform to run again.\n\nHe took it for granted that the old \u2018governor as leader\u2019 formula would subsist, not knowing he had landed in shark-infested waters. His attempts at imposing his will have been robustly resisted not just because those who called the shots formerly were powerful; they were also age-old allies of Wike \u2013 whose influence is far-reaching within the South-South PDP and across the party nationwide.\n\nThe frustration reached a peak triggering suggestions that Obaseki might just have another attack of Sokugo \u2013 that famous wandering disease \u2013 referenced by Cyprian Ekwensi in his classic \u2018Burning Grass.\u2019 His deputy Shaibu openly declared that if those resisting them would not bend, there were other options to the PDP.\n\nObaseki had clearly not reached that point, warning the resistance at one point to either accept him as leader or leave the party. These were not the words of a politician who understood compromise, but those of a conqueror fresh from vanquishing an acclaimed godfather. They spoke of the giddy power of governors who can determine everything from who becomes local government councillor to who gets elected president.\n\nWhat Obaseki and Shaibu haven\u2019t considered is that the conditions and dramatis personae that enabled them prevail over Oshiomhole are different from those of their latest battle in PDP. Equally, their direct opponent is made of sterner stuff.\n\nFor while the former APC chairman was known as a pugnacious fighter right from his days as president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), he also has a softer, philosophical side \u2013 realising when to fold his tent and go home following his political humiliation.\n\nThe same cannot be said of Wike who has clearly not heard of the saying that he who fights and runs away lives to fight another day. He embraces every new clash with gusto and plunges into fresh conflicts headlong.\n\nI think of the Rivers governor and I am reminded of the boxing style of such iconic heavyweight champions as Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson. It doesn\u2019t matter what you throw at them, they keep coming back at you \u2013 grinding you down slowly, relentlessly.\n\nWike is not an elegant boxer; he\u2019s not averse to throwing the odd below-the-belt punch. In his latest broadside against Obaseki he managed to drag some allegations about the Edo governor\u2019s face-off with the Oba of Benin over returned Benin artefacts, into a matter that was purely about internal party intrigues.\n\nCheck his never-ending war with his erstwhile boss and current Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi or his bitter break-up with former PDP chairman, Uche Secondus, a man he helped install in office and you find the same pattern \u2013 relentless counter attack with no quarter given.\n\nIn some ways the two governors are alike: both love a good scrap and don\u2019t like to back down. They love to have the last word, but the Rivers governor is in a special class when it comes to this. So Shaibu hurling threats at the PDP was akin to waving a red flag in the face of the bull in a bullfight.\n\nObaseki, couldn\u2019t understand why Wike was so enraged, telling him the PDP wasn\u2019t his personal property. How wrong he is! Maybe it wasn\u2019t eight years ago. After the loss of federal power and patronage there was need for someone to step up and sustain the party. There were not too many takers \u2013 leaving the Rivers governor to pay the bills and call the shots.\n\nPost-2015 his influence over the party has been well-nigh suffocating. Some governors have fled the opposition ranks citing his supposed overbearing ways. Wike has a vice grip on the party. If the Edo governor doesn\u2019t get that, then he doesn\u2019t understand APC is not PDP!\n\nAs things stand Obaseki may no longer enjoy his stay in his new home unless he\u2019s willing to crawl to Port Harcourt with his tail between his legs to beg the king. That\u2019s not a viable option for a guy who boasts about putting godfathers out of business.\n\nBut with his newly-minted foe, who doesn\u2019t look like the forgiving sort, threatening: \u201cLet me tell you Obaseki, I know your cohorts and I will smoke all of you out,\u201d he\u2019d better watch out.\n\nOne theme Wike kept harping on in his statement was \u2018betrayal.\u2019 But what did he expect? In the amoral defection politics that has prevailed in Nigeria through the years, people change parties to get elected into office. They don\u2019t make the switch because of deep ideological convictions or anything so elevated.\n\nWhen Obaseki was negotiating with the PDP many speculated his heart wasn\u2019t really in it; he only wanted to use the platform to secure re-election and return to APC. Since achieving his objective he has often stated his desire to remain in his new home. But at the first sign of trouble talk of defection has been revived. It\u2019s all about control and hanging on to power.\n\nThat said, Wike\u2019s sense of moral outrage does seem a bit overdone. He bemoans Obaseki\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d and swears he\u2019s never done anything similar to anyone. It would be interesting to know what his former boss Amaechi thinks and what words he would use to describe their parting of ways. Betrayal, perhaps? Politics is a bitch.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a clash of two individuals with outsize egos. It is all so revelatory of the depth of the internal crises raging within Nigeria\u2019s two largest political parties. Both are bitterly riven with factions. The APC is staggering under a cloud of confusion towards a national convention with no clue whether it would come out whole or in bits.\n\nThe PDP is no better as the politics of zoning threatens to rip it apart.\n\nUnfortunately for the country, there are no other options to take advantage of these parties going into elections divided. Those who claim to be offering a third way are reverting to the old formula of gathering names. No one is making any effort to capture the imagination of the country with the power of their ideas.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the end, one of the jaded big two parties that is better able to manage the fallout from ongoing clash of egos, would find itself in power, leaving us all with that sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday accused his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, of betrayal, describing him as ungrateful.\n\nWike said former All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Adams Oshiomole, had been vindicated.\n\nHe said he was sorry for ignoring Oshiomhole\u2019s warnings about Obaseki, adding that everything the former APC chairman said about the character of the Edo State governor had come to pass.\n\nWike spoke during the inauguration of an expanded Community Secondary School project in Omuanwa, Ikwere Local Government Area.\n\nWike\u2019s war of words with Obaseki began with Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu threatening to leave the PDP due to a crisis in the state chapter.\n\nObaseki and Shaibu defected to the PDP after the APC denied them second term tickets.\n\nWike urged the party to sanction Shaibu, describing his threat to leave the party as \u201ca shame.\u201d He added that the deputy governor was ranting.\n\n\u201cA deputy governor comes and threatens the whole party where we are governors\u2026who is his father,\u201d Wike had said.\n\nObaseki reacted by saying that the PDP does not belong to Wike and that \u201cpolitical bullies\u201d were not accepted in Edo State.\n\nWike attacks governor\n\nFiring back yesterday, Wike said: \u201cIf you ask anybody or check the DNA of Godwin Obaseki, what you will see in that DNA is serial betrayal and ungratefulness.\n\n\u201cLet me stand today to apologise to Adams Oshiomole, who had been vindicated by telling us that we would see the true colour, the insincerity and the ungratefulness of Governor Obaseki.\n\n\u201cLet me say you have been vindicated. You were right and we were wrong. I have never seen people so ungrateful in life and people who can betray everything.\n\n\u201cI will never betray anybody because what you will see in my DNA is sincerity, consistency and teamwork.\u201d\n\nWike also blasted Obaseki for calling him a bully.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou came to beg a bully for you to have a ticket. A bully was your DG Campaign and a bully bullied you into Government House. What a shame.\n\n\u201cYou came back with your wife to thank the bully saying that after God, the bully made it possible for you to be there.\u201d\n\nWike said Obaseki\u2019s utterances were beyond politics, adding that only politics would make people know the character of an individual.\n\nOn Obaseki\u2019s claims that he threatened the PDP because of Ndudi Elumelu, Wike said he only stood by the party\u2019s earlier agreement on who should emerge as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cPDP wrote to the National Assembly nominating the Minority Leader of the House. The Speaker by the connivance of some PDP people announced Ndudi Elumelu as the leader of PDP.\n\n\u201cThat is sabotage \u2013 APC nominating Leader for us in the House. And I say no, we can\u2019t accept this,\u201d he said.\n\nWike said he had no business with Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State leaving the PDP.\n\n\u201cSatan has agents. Most of the people you see are agents of Satan. I am not in the class of Obaseki. We can\u2019t be the same. I was the DG of his campaign.\n\n\u201cI went there for three days and stayed there without having my bath. We bought even the drinks we drank there. It was Lucky Igbinedon that fed us. I have never seen somebody like Obaseki in my life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018I have more stake in PDP than Obaseki\u2019\n\nWike said he would never support the injustice and impunity that Obaseki planned for PDP.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Benin artefacts where you are challenging the Oba, which you lost woefully. This is politics.\n\n\u201cObaseki, I have more stake in PDP than you. In all the elections we had run, he made no contribution. If you ask him he would say he didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cA party had done congresses, formed structures, you came and we told the party\u2019s structure to support you and they did.\n\n\u201cThe Zonal Chairman, Chief Dan Orbih , was campaign manager under the COVID. COVID affected him and we had to take him out. People should not be ungrateful in life,\u201d he said.\n\nWike recalled that a former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose, predicted that Obaseki would win the election but that he would not stay in PDP, observing that the Edo governor was frequently holding meetings with the APC.\n\nOn his presidential ambition that Obaseki referred to, Wike said: \u201cI am qualified if not more than qualified. I challenge Obaseki and his cohorts, some of the presidential aspirants who are using him to talk to come out openly.\n\n\u201cIf I decide to run tomorrow, I challenge everybody, including Obaseki, what you will see you will say you never know this is how politics is.\n\n\u201cIf I want to run, Obaseki can\u2019t give me permission. I gave him the seat. I will win. Send your aspirants to pray I don\u2019t come out, if I come out I will defeat them.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers governor said whereas people could see his giant strides that had transformed Port Harcourt, Edo capital city Benin had remained the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember it has started. By the time I make you emaciate, you will know where you are. Since you are ready for war, don\u2019t backslide. Stay there and be prepared. Your envy will not help you,\u201d he said.\n\nWike further dared Obaseki to publish the contractors working on projects in Edo, boasting that in Rivers, the contractors were known.\n\nHe said the school being inaugurated was built by an indigenous contractor.\n\n\u2018Obaseki lacks capacity\u2019\n\nOn the Edo PDP crisis, Wike said: \u201cI cannot see how you can be a governor and you are looking for a party structure. It shows you don\u2019t have the capacity. Who are the party leaders that will not come to the governor? And you are looking for harmonisation.\n\n\u201cHarmonise what? Did we harmonise the governor and the deputy governor? When you were coming, why didn\u2019t you give the PDP people Deputy Governor? Then you want to harmonise the party structure that people have suffered for.\n\n\u201cShow you are a leader. Leadership is not by mouth. It is by action. I challenge Obaseki to come and cause crisis in Rivers as he said I was causing in Edo.\n\n\u201cI cannot be intimidated. You have started what you cannot finish. I am a capacity governor. If I have resources, it is to the glory of God and it is part of the resources that were deployed to you. If you are not happy return the resources.\u201d\n\nWike faulted Obaseki\u2019s claims that he compelled the party to hold its last National Convention in Port Harcourt, explaining that his position on the venue of the convention was based on PDP\u2019s earlier decision.\n\nHe said following the decision to adopt Port Harcourt as the venue, he had invited all hotel owners and urged them to spend money and give their facilities a face-lift in preparation for that convention.\n\n\u201cThey spent their money. But some presidential aspirants went back to say they would not go to Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cAs a lover of the state and this party, I said you cannot make people to spend money and then overnight you say you won\u2019t come again.\n\n\u201cBut assuming though not conceding that I threatened the party, I have invested in the party; Rivers has invested in the party.\n\n\u201cWe have voted for PDP since 1999 till now. Ask Obaseki whether he has done anything for PDP. Has he voted for PDP?\n\n\u201cThe only election that he voted was his own when we gave him an umbrella. I have more stake in PDP. Obaseki has never supported PDP.\n\n\u201cIt was when his godfather chased you away and you came begging, kneeling down. People came with pressure.

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has asked the Abuja division of the Federal High Court to reject the bail applications filed by the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, and four members of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), on the grounds that they are likely to be charged for money laundering offences.\n\nIn addition, the agency said there is strong evidence that the defendants, who allegedly have over the years developed contacts with criminal elements, would interfere with prosecution witnesses if released on bail.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nIn a 20 paragraph counter affidavit before the court, in opposition to their bail applications, the agency equally expressed fears that given their huge influence in the police and criminal underworld, the defendants are likely to tamper with financial records and interfere with financial investigation.\n\nThe NDLEA had alleged that Kyari, who was chairman of the IRT, and his deputy, ACP Sunday Ubua, have received over N4.3 billion from their separate bank accounts.\n\nThe agency also urged the court to reject the bail applications on the ground that \u201cconsidering the seriousness of the offences, the character of evidence against them and their antecedents of not wanting to submit themselves to investigation and the criminal justice process, as well as the enormous resources at their disposal, there is likelihood of the defendants/applicants taking flight if granted bail.\n\nWhile adopting the counter-affidavit before trial Justice Emeka Nwite, yesterday, the NDLEA, through its Director, Prosecution & Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday, maintained that: \u201cThe charge before this honourable court indicates that the defendants are charged with serious offences for which the punishment is not less than 15 years imprisonment upon conviction.\u201d\n\nIt is to be noted that the NDLEA has reportedly sent a report to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, detailing the financial transactions of Kyari and some members of his IRT.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe agency said not less than N1.4 billion passed through Kyari\u2019s account while he was commander of the IRT.\n\nHowever, in the case of Kyari\u2019s deputy, Ubua, the agency said he may have received far more than him as not less than N2.8 billion was traced to his eight bank accounts.\n\nAccording to investigations, Ubua allegedly received a lump sum of N2.664 billion on August 15, 2019. The NDLEA is now working on the assumption that the sums traced to Kyari and his deputy may be connected to the sale of some illicit substances, including tramadol worth N3 billion.\n\nKyari and six others are facing eight counts of conspiracy, obstruction, and dealing in cocaine, and other related offences at the Federal High Court, Abuja. The other defendants in the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, are four members of the IRT, Ubua, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu.\n\nMeanwhile, two other suspects arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne, have pleaded guilty to counts five, six and seven of the eight-count charge.\n\nHowever, Kyari, in his bail application that was moved by Mr. Mahmud Magaji, SAN, prayed the court to grant him bail on liberal conditions.\n\nArguing that the charge against him contained bailable offences, the embattled DCP, urged the court to invoke the powers donated to it by the 1999 Constitution, as amended, to exercise discretion in his favour.\n\nThe NDLEA, however, urged the court to deny all the defendants bail and rather okay accelerated hearing of the case.\n\nBefore the court adjourned the matter till March 28, the NDLEA said it was no longer willing to retain the third, fourth and fifth defendants in its custody due to their \u201cunruly behaviour\u201d. It told the court that the defendants were \u201ccausing a lot of disturbances\u201d.\n\nConsequently, lawyers to the three defendants, took turns to enter an undertaking before the court, pledging that their clients would be of good behaviour \u201cfrom now onwards\u201d.\n\nJustice Nwite said he would order the transfer of the three defendants to a Correctional Centre, should the court receive any further report of their unruly behaviour.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari\u2019s wife, Ramatu, slumped and fainted shortly after the court adjourned the matter for ruling.\n\nThe middle-aged woman, who wore a black Hijab, fell on the floor around 11am, while armed operatives of the NDLEA were leading Kyari and the others away from the court premises. Though she appeared lifeless on the floor, she was quickly carried up and rushed inside one of the offices on the third floor of the court by some officials of the NDLEA and lawyers.\n\nOne of the officials later emerged from the office, demanding an inhaler, even as one of the women who accompanied Ramatu to the court hinted that she was asthmatic.\n\nKyari, who was initially being led out of the court premises, was brought back to assist in resuscitating his wife.\n\nRamatu was eventually escorted out of the court premises around 11:45am by her friends and relatives about 15 minutes after her husband, DCP Kyari, was led out by NDLEA officials.",

          "text": "\u2022Discos apologise to customers, minister calls emergency meeting of stakeholders\n\n\u2022Aviation fuel scarcity: We have three days to shut down operations, airlines warn\n\n\u2022Agree with regulators, oil marketers to sell at N500 per liter for 72hrs\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu, Juliet Akoje in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national power grid collapsed yesterday, causing a nationwide outage as the entire system crashed due to the loss of 1,100 megawatts from a 3,700mw peak generation earlier recorded.\n\nThis was just as airline operators in Nigeria yesterday warned that they have only three days left to shut down operations over lingering scarcity of aviation fuel.\n\nFor the power sector, as at yesterday afternoon, the system was yet to pick up load, according to a grid operations report, which showed that just three Generation Companies (Gencos) were trying to restart, but were yet to generate any energy.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, called an emergency meeting yesterday to resolve all outstanding issues with the stakeholders in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) as a result of the worsening power situation.\n\nAccording to the grid operation trend, of the active 25 Gencos on the grid, 19 were producing power as of 6am, when the grid had 3,867.60MW, but that began to reduce gradually until it dropped to 2,761.20MW by 10am after six Gencos went down, leaving just 13, before crashing to zero at 10.40 am.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that at least 1,100MW was initially lost from the 3,867MW peak generation before the Gencos started shutting down.\n\nThe analysis showed that the affected plants included Azura-Edo IPP (Gas), which was generating 447MW earlier, and Shiroro hydropower, which had 300MW earlier and later went off. Trans-Amadi (Gas) lost 92MW, Alaoji NIPP (Gas) lost 75MW, while Ihovbor NIPP (Gas) lost 101MW.\n\nAs of yesterday, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which manages the power grid, had yet to comment on the immediate cause of the collapse, although, it was the first in the year.\n\nThe blackout had worsened throughout the country around 10:40am, after the national grid collapsed, with the Eko Electricity Distribution Company, confirming the incident in a text message to its customers.\n\nThe text message read, \u201cDear esteemed customers, a system collapse occurred on the national grid at 10:40am today, leading to outages across our network. We are working on the situation with our TCN partners and will keep you updated.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d\n\nAbuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) also pleaded for the understanding of its customers, noting that it is taking appropriate steps to ameliorate the effect.\n\nThe Disco stated, \u201cDear esteemed customer, we experienced general outage across AEDC network at 10:40am today due to a system collapse which occurred on the national grid.\n\n\u201cAppropriate measures are now being taken to restore normal supply as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\nWhile confirming the system collapse yesterday, Kaduna Electricity assured its customers that power would soon be restored.\n\nIt stated, \u201cWe regret to inform you that the power outage being experienced in our franchise states is due to system collapse of the national grid which occurred about 10:40am.\n\n\u201cPower supply shall be restored as soon as the National Grid is powered back. Our sincere apologies for any inconvenience.\u201d\n\nIn its notice to customers, Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc said the system collapse affected supply in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states.\n\nThe notice signed by EEDC Head, Corporate Communications, Emeka Ezeh, read, \u201cThe Enugu Electricity Distribution PLC (EEDC) wishes to inform her esteemed customers in the South East of a general system collapse which occurred this morning, Monday, 14th March 2022 at 10:40 am.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason for the loss of supply currently being experienced across the network.\n\n\u201cConsequently, all our outgoing feeders are out and supply to our customers in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states is affected by this development.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the power minister yesterday held an emergency meeting with all stakeholders in the power sector to address the current low power generation. He warned that stakeholders must work together to make electricity more stable.\n\nThe meeting held at the conference hall of the ministry had in attendance delegations from the Gencos, TCN, Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Nigerian National Petroleum Company ( NNPC), Shell, and other stakeholders in the power value chain.\n\nA source at the meeting quoted Aliyu as saying, \u201cThis meeting was summoned to address the current electricity situation in the country, which we are not happy about. We must find a solution so that Nigerians will have electricity. I want us to have the patience to talk to each other, not blame each other.\u201d\n\nAliyu maintained that the Nigerian government would not relent in its effort to ensure that improvements in the power sector were sustained and built upon, adding that current challenges must be addressed.\n\nThe meeting, according to the minister, would find solutions that would ensure prompt resolution of all the problems affecting power generation currently besetting Nigeria.\n\nIn Lagos, the Egbin Power Plc also recorded a collapse in its power generating system for the second time in 2022. The Egbin Power system collapse, which occurred about 10:40am, was witnessed by journalists who were at the venue to cover the 2022 edition of Egbin Graduate Engineers Programme (GEP).\n\nThe incident happened in the presence of the top management team of Egbin, including Group Managing Director of Sahara Power Group and Chairman of Ikeja Electric, Mr. Kola Adesina, among others.\n\nThe Minister of Power had penultimate week blamed the low water level at the dams for the worsening power supply in the country.\n\nTCN also had last week attributed the worsening power situation to low power generation from generation companies (Gencos).\n\nThe Gencos in turn fired back on Sunday, as their Executive Secretary, Dr Joy Ogaji, blamed the worsening state of power supply in the country on the N1.6 trillion owed them by the federal government since 2013.\n\nThe Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), on its part, disputed the Gencos\u2019 debt claim, saying only companies with active gas supply and transportation contracts were paid for unutilised capacity.\n\nThe Sahara Power GMD expressed sadness over the poor state of the country\u2019s power sector and the endless blame game among players in the sector.\n\nAdesina, \u201cI hate what is going on. As a Nigerian, I\u2019m displeased, I\u2019m not happy and I will tell you why. All that Nigerians want today is power. Isn\u2019t it? No blame game now, no story.\n\n\u201cJust give power to the people, end of discussion. When generation says it\u2019s gas, story. When gas says because people are not paying them, story. When TCN says Discos are not taking power, story. So, it\u2019s just stories. We don\u2019t want stories. I\u2019m tired of the contradictory stories and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nAdesina said the blame game in the sector could only be solved in a sincere dialogue by all the market participants.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOnce that is done, the problem will be solved, and I know that the Minister of Power is already planning to bring all the sector participants together to have a conversation to resolve this problem.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Board of Directors of Eko Electricity Distribution Company approved the appointment of Dr. Tinuade Sanda as Deputy Managing Director of the company. Prior to her appointment, Sanda was Chief Accounting Officer, a position she had occupied since 2013.\n\nThis announcement was made by EKEDC General Manager, Corporate Communications, Godwin Idemudia.\n\nIdemudia said in the statement, \u201cWe are pleased to announce that the Board of Eko DisCo has approved the appointment of Dr. Tinuade Sanda as the new Deputy CEO, which is in line with the company\u2019s strategies and procedures.\n\n\u201cThe Board and Management are confident in Sanda\u2019s proficiency and capacity to assist in leading the company towards its vision of becoming the leading and customer-centric electricity distribution company in Africa.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the appointment, Board Chairman, EKEDC, Mr. Oritsedere Otubu, said, \u201cWe are proud to announce Tinuade Sanda our first female Deputy CEO. Her appointment has proven the resilience of our succession planning mechanisms and the value we place on our corporate governance practices, which underpin our philosophy of building and recognising home-grown talents.\u201d\n\nAviation Fuel Scarcity: We Have Three Days to Shut Down Operations, Airlines Warn\n\nAirline Operators in Nigeria yesterday warned that they have only three days left to shut down operations over lingering scarcity of aviation fuel.\n\nIn their presentation, Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) threatened that they had only three days to shut down operations over lack of aviation fuel.\n\nRepresented by the Chief Executive Officer of Airpeace, Mr. Allen Onyema, expressed concern over the high cost of aviation fuel.\n\nThis was as the stakeholders in the aviation sector agreed to peg the price of the aviation fuel at N500 per litre.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari announced the decision at the meeting of the stakeholders with the special committee of the House of Representatives investigating the circumstances surrounding the recent hike in the price of aviation fuel chaired by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase.\n\nThe resolution to peg the price at N500 per litre would be experimented for only three days from today and within the period the Association of Airline Operators and the major oil marketers are to engage themselves and work out modalities that would lead to the permanent reduction of the price of aviation fuel in the country.\n\nKyari, however disclosed that at the moment there were 19 oil companies with 88 million litres of aviation fuel in the country.\n\nThe NNPC boss explained: \u201cWe know this is a very difficult situation. We know that once aviation fuel increases, prices of flight ticket will certainly increase and this can surely cost pain for Nigerians. That is why we are working with you to ensure that those pains are minimised to the barest minimum and one of the elements is the pricing of aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cSo, what we have engaged with MOMAN, DAPMAN and the airline operators is that in three days\u2019 time, their representatives will sit down and agree on a transparent base for pricing.\n\n\u201cThat means that they ought to have a referenced benchmark that is quoted transparently in the market. They will have a referenced exchange rate for the naira so that anyone can compete.\n\n\u201cThey will also agree on a premium which currently differs from customer-to-customer, depending on the volume you buy and the credit level.\u201d\n\nKyari added: \u201cThese are the things they can negotiate in three days and close, so that going forward, there is a transparent decision on pricing. This will no doubt throw up the actual value of the product in the market.\n\n\u201cYou will no longer see these discrepancies we have seen where some people are selling at N445 and some are selling at N630. This will completely bring close such that you will not see these differences.\n\n\u201cWe also agreed that in the interim, between now and three days they have to close negotiations, the lowest price we have seen this morning was N445 and the highest was N605.\n\n\u201cThere is a trader that is selling at N630 and we don\u2019t think this is normal and so, we discounted it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the NNPC GMD said it was, \u201cagreed that we sell at N500 in the next three days and after that, they will switch to the new price that everyone can assess.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, as requested by the Airline Operators Association of Nigeria, \u201cthey would be granted license by the authority to import petroleum products, particularly ATK so that they can have a way of benchmarking the sales of other customers and can also bring in cheaper products whenever it is possible.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the operators through Onyema requested for licencing of its members for the importation of Aviation Fuel to end the perennial hike in the price and scarcity of ATK.\n\nThey maintained that they have the competence to import the required ATK for their operations without any hitches.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWe can afford to import this fuel, let NNPC give us the licence and we will no longer complain. I have the mandate of every airline in this country to announce to you that if they can\u2019t come down from their rooftops, we have only three more days to be able to fly. \u201cWe are not threatening this country. We have been subsiding what we have been doing. The rate as at today is N630, N640 and N605. We have an aircraft going to Kano, it has about 7000 liters of fuel in it, multiple it, sir by N630. The unit cost per seat is about N70000 per seat. You have not talked about insurance that is very static. Nigerians pay heavy insurance premium because this country is stigmatised.\n\n\u201cYou have to insure abroad. It is a must because all the insurance companies in Nigeria put together cannot even pay for one aircraft. So, you have to go abroad to insure. \u201cYet the fuel cost which is supposed to be about 30 to 40 per cent in every clime, in Nigeria it about 70 per cent even before time. So, you can now see the mortality rate of airlines in this country.\n\n\u201cFrom what is happening, if it continues this way, the least ticket will be about N120 for economy and we don\u2019t want to do that. We want to inform the house that we are demanding that we should be given licence to import this fuel. If we can buy jets that cost hundreds of billions of dollars, we can afford to import this fuel.\u201d\n\nResponding to the resolutions read by the NNPC GMD, Onyeama said the implication of the N500 per litre benchmark for three days was that the ticket for airfare would be N85,000 per seat on economy.\n\nThey however expressed gratitude to the House of Representatives and the NNPC for standing by the operators.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Speaker, Wase faulted the presentation made by the Chief Executive, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, Ahmed Farouk, who was represented by an Executive Director, Ogbogu Ukoha who insisted that prices had been discounted.\n\nWase had asked the regulatory body the current price of the product and why it was so exorbitant but was referred to the marketers who however sidestepped the questions and could not give specific answers.\n\nHe thereafter warned NMDPRA against blackmailing the government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Tinubu at loggerheads with Osinbajo, Fayemi over choice of Omisore as national secretary\n\n\u2022Omo-Agege wants national publicity secretary in Delta State\n\n\u2022We are not aware of ruling party\u2019s leadership change, INEC insists\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crisis in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the zoning of national offices, ahead of the party\u2019s national convention scheduled for March 26, has shifted to the zones. State governors are clashing with other party leaders over who gets what in the proposed arrangement.\n\nMultiple sources told THISDAY yesterday that the leadership of APC was sharply divided over the micro-zoning of the party offices.\n\nAn insider said many of the APC governors in the North-central, for instance, want the position of National Chairman thrown open, against the purported endorsement of Senator Abdullahi Adamu by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOne of chairmanship aspirants told THISDAY, \u201cSince the party has allocated the position to the North-central, the zone should be allowed to decide who becomes its choice, rather than by imposition, as being speculated in the media.\u201d\n\nOther aspirants in the race for National Chairman in the zone include Senator Tanko Al-Makura and Saliu Mustapha.\n\nIn the South-west, where the post of National Secretary had been zoned, national leader of APC and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, was said to be at odds with the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, as well as Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun over the choice of Senator Iyiola Omisore from Osun State for the position.\n\nAPC governors in the zone were said to have settled for Omisore for National Secretary, \u201cfor political strategy,\u201d but Tinubu and former National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, were said to be opposed to the choice.\n\nSimilarly, in the South-south, the micro-zoning of National Publicity Secretary to Delta State, which was believed to have been influenced by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, THISDAY learnt, was generating conflict among party leaders in the zone.\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC officially approved the recommendations of its committee on zoning arrangement recently. In the zoning agreement, the posts of National Chairman and Deputies of National Secretary, National Legal Adviser, National Publicity Secretary, and others were allocated to the North-central.\n\nThe positions of National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, and Deputy National Welfare Secretary were zoned to South-south.\n\nThe positions of National Secretary, National Youth Leader, and Deputy National Auditor were expected to be shared by members in South-west states, comprising Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo.\n\nThe South-east got the positions of Deputy National Chairman (South), National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, and Deputy National Organising Secretary, among others.\n\nNorth-east was to produce Deputy National Chairman (North), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (North-east), Deputy National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Women Leader.\n\nThe North-west zone would produce the National Vice Chairman (North-west), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Youth Leader.\n\nMeanwhile, there appeared to be no deal yet between the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the ruling party over the latter\u2019s planned March 17 emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting. The electoral umpire insisted it was not aware of any leadership change in APC.\n\nINEC insisted it would not monitor the NEC meeting because the letter inviting it to observe the exercise, as required by law, was not signed by persons vested with such power by the CECPC headed by Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, and Senator John Akpanudoedehe, as Chairman and Secretary, respectively. The commission\u2019s position on the planned NEC meeting was made clear yesterday by INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, while speaking on a national television.\n\nOkoye said INEC would follow the Electoral Act in dealing with the political parties. He stressed that the commission was only advising APC to follow the rules of the game.\n\nThe INEC commissioner stated, \u201cINEC is only telling the APC that it recognises only letters signed by the CECPC Chairman and Secretary of APC and not letters signed by other party chieftains who are not recognised by the commission.\n\n\u201cAside this, the Electoral Act states that INEC must be given a 21 days\u2019 notice of any planned meeting of political parties for it to get ready to monitor such meetings of political parties.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye explained that APC could go ahead and hold the NEC meeting, pointing out, though, that if the meeting would lead to a change of leadership, the commission would not accept or recognise such outcome.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe APC has been reminded of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 Notice of any Convention, Congress, Conference, or Meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its Executive Committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective offices.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 77 of the Electoral Act 2022 says political parties must provide the authentic Register of Members during Convention, Congress, Conference, or Meetings which INEC will monitor. These are the crux of the matter.\u201d\n\nINEC had on Friday stated, in response to a letter by APC inviting the commission to an emergency NEC meeting of the party convened by Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello, on behalf of the CECPC, that it did not recognise Bello as the APC chairman.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position attracted criticism from some APC chieftains, who openly dared INEC to stand in the way of the NEC meeting on Thursday and the proposed national convention on March 26.\n\nSpokesman of CECPC, Ismaila Ahmed, who is also APC Youth Leader, was very critical of INEC\u2019s stand on being served a \u201cthe 21 days\u2019 notice of any meeting by political parties\u201d, as recommended by the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nTHISDAY reported yesterday that leaders of the ruling party might have agreed to keep Buni as Interim Chairman of CECPC, while Bello functioned as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity. Buni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as CECPC chairman. It was gathered that the party maintained that the letter of transition remained in force, even though Buni remained interim caretaker chairman.\n\nIt was also reported that the fate of the CECPC secretary was uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out. A faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate he was keen on holding the meeting. Apparently miffed by what he was told, the president was said to have directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Edo governor: We\u2019ve history of dealing with bullies\n\nAdibe Emenyonu\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, yesterday, threw caution to the wind and descended heavily on a fellow governor, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, describing him as a serial betrayer, a disposition he further claimed was directly connected to his DNA.\n\nWike, who replied to Obaseki\u2019s response to his initial diatribe against his deputy, however, said a former Edo State governor and sacked national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomole, had been vindicated by Obaseki\u2019s actions.\n\nBut in replying to Wike\u2019s initial attack against the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, Obaseki described the Rivers governor\u2019s attack as \u201cmost unfortunate and totally uncalled for,\u201d warning that Edo State has a history of dealing with bullies.\n\nHowever, Wike, who tendered an apology to Oshiomhole for ignoring his warnings about Obaseki, stated that everything Oshiomhole said about the character of the Edo governor had come to pass.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you ask anybody or check the DNA of Obaseki, you will discover that he is a serial betrayer and an ungrateful person. I apologise to Oshiomhole, who told us about Obaseki. You have been vindicated,\u201d the Rivers governor said.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of Community Secondary School, Omuanwa, in Ikwerre LGA, Wike added: \u201cDr. Abiye Sekibo called me and told me not to reply Obaseki, but I said no. I will reply him, I\u2019m a politician. Obaseki said I\u2019m a bully, but he came to beg a bully for ticket, a bully was his campaign Director General and a bully bullied him into Edo State Government House.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t end there, he still came back with his wife to thank the bully after the election. I slept in Edo State for three days just to deliver Obaseki, but today, I\u2019m a bully. If you check the DNA of Obaseki, what you\u2019ll see is betrayal, serial betrayal and ungratefulness.\n\n\u201cHe said I threatened PDP, assuming without conceding that I threatened PDP, I have every right to do so. I have invested in the party. Rivers State has invested in the party. Rivers State is one of the few states that has voted PDP since 1999. We have invested in the party. You\u2019re a tenant in PDP, I have more stake in PDP than you.\n\n\u201cYou said I\u2019m causing crisis in Edo State, I have capacity, that is why I\u2019m causing crisis. I challenge you to come and cause crisis in Rivers state, then you\u2019ll know who is who. Obaseki, I know your cohorts, I will smoke all of you out. Obaseki, I challenge you to defect back to the APC, we\u2019ll shave your head.\n\n\u201cI know those using you, if I decide to run for president, I will win all of you. Obaseki, melembe melembe. The game has started, I will make you lose weight.\u201d\n\nBut in his response to the initial trigger, Obaseki, in a paid advertorial in some national newspapers, called on the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to call Wike to order, because the issues raised by his deputy were germane and needed to be resolved in the interest of the party.\n\nHe said the personal attacks by Wike against Shaibu was to say the least, most unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\n\nHis words: \u201cIf Governor Wike was one who is wont to show respect and courtesy to his colleague-governors, he would have ordinarily reached out to me to express his concerns about the views made by my deputy governor, rather than embarking on this unwarranted public onslaught.\n\n\u201cMy deputy governor is a former National President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and his comment is representative of the essence of the nation\u2019s youth population, who are inclined to openly speak up and question the status quo.\n\n\u201cIf governor Wike cannot understand and adequately respond to the style and character of the Nigerian youth, how can he aspire to lead them?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Governor Wike should have taken a cue from the manner in which the National Chairman of our party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, responded to my deputy\u2019s remarks, as a conscientious leader, who is able to show empathy and consideration,\u201d the Edo governor stated.\n\nHe pointed out that the concerns expressed by his deputy bordered on pertinent issues affecting the PDP in Edo State, which \u201csince the September 19th 2020 elections, has been able to register over 500,000 members; and till date, these new members have not been properly integrated into our party after two years. Also, the leaders, executives and members who came with me into the party have still not been accepted, integrated or harmonised into the party.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the fact that old members of Edo PDP, who are open to inclusion and supportive of building a large party are being vilified and ostracised by a cabal purportedly led by Chief Dan Orbih, who is your perpetual guest in Port Harcourt and is remotely used to orchestrate the destabilisation of the party in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to recall at this point that a political solution gave rise to the emergence of Chief Dan Orbih first as Acting and then as Substantive National Vice Chairman, South South, of our party, when Chief Emma Odidi resigned that position to allow Chief Orbih to ascend. It is, therefore, curious why this type of political solution is no longer tenable to resolve the political impasse in Edo State PDP.\n\n\u201cWe can categorically state that in the comments of the deputy governor, he at no point threatened the party as Governor Wike has alleged. Rather, it is Governor Wike, who has at different times, threatened the PDP.\n\n\u201cSome of these instances include: On September 16, 2018, Governor Wike threatened the party that there would be grave consequences if it moved the National Convention from Port Harcourt in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cOn September 12, 2019, Governor Wike also threatened to cause trouble for the party over the emergence of Hon. Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that Wike had contributed to the advancement of the party, just like others, since 1999, he posited that, \u201cNo one is against his desire to run for president, however, his ambition should not be embarked on in such a way that it would cause disruption at different levels, such as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum as well as different chapters of the party across the country.\n\n\u201cIt clearly amounts to delusion of grandeur, for any one man to nurse the idea that he owns or has more stake in the PDP and everyone should pander to him. We are all equal stakeholders in the party and an aggregate of the ideas, opinions and contributions of all leaders and members should form the position of the party and not the view of one individual or a select few.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Wike is free to use his resources as he deems fit in pursuit of his ambition, he should not attempt to cow, intimidate, cajole and threaten others into doing his bidding. Edo State cannot and will not be procured for anyone\u2019s personal ambition.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs now are strong democratic institutions and not strong men; that is why we will join the great leaders of our party across the country to build PDP into a strong, large and indomitable party that will win next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike and his collaborators headed by Chief Dan Orbih in Edo State will not succeed in destabilising the PDP in Edo State as they did other states like Cross River just to secure delegates to actualize his alleged personal ambition to run for presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we don\u2019t accept political bullies and overlords and historically, we have demonstrated our capacity to unshackle ourselves and dethrone bullies and highhanded leaders.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all well-meaning leaders of our great party to call Governor Wike to order to desist from his current unguarded and disruptive tendencies. From all indications, today, PDP is set to take over the leadership of Nigeria provided we can rein in the self-interest of a few leaders to put the task of rescuing Nigeria above their personal ambitions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nImo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, yesterday insisted that Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, who is currently on medical leave will return as Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee of the All Progressive Congress (APC), noting that every activity currently going on at the party\u2019s national secretariat were still being sanctioned by Mai Buni.\n\nUzodinma ,who was a guest on Channels Television programme, Politics Today, said that he was not aware of any directive given by President Muhammadu Buhari to remove Mai Buni as the party caretaker chairman as narrated by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, last week.\n\nNiger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, had last Monday stormed the APC national secretariat and took over affairs of the party in what many had considered to be a palace coup.\n\nFollowing the incident, Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai confirmed on a live TV interview that it was the end of Buni\u2019s reign as caretaker chairman of the party and would be returning as the governor of Yobe State on the instruction of President Buhari.\n\n\u201cBuni is gone, the secretary is gone. Governor Bello is in charge and he has the backing of President Muhammadu Buhari and 19 governors. Buni can only return as governor of Yobe but never as chairman of our party,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, contrary to El-Rufai\u2019s claims, Uzodinma, said Buni was still in charge of the party\u2019s affairs and would return as caretaker chairman, noting that the purported removal of Buni was in the first place illegal and could not have been sanctioned by President Buhari, whom he said was a true democrat.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The chairman of Caretaker Extra Ordinary Committee for Convention is Alhaji Mai Mala Buni the Governor of Yobe State. Let me tell you how this thing works. The business of politics is more serious than some people think. He is the chairman of the party and he is there by the mandate of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and he travelled for medicals. Governor Bello is acting for him for now. As soon as he comes back, he will resume.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is the decision of NEC, and once NEC has taken a decision, nobody can change it unless NEC meets again to make another decision. But for now, until NEC meets. That is why I am not surprised that INEC wrote that letter that he was the one to sign. He is really the one to sign because before he is removed, there must be another meeting of NEC to rescind the decision.\n\nBut when asked about the directive given to APC governors by the President to remove Buni as alleged by El-Rufai, he said he was not aware of such directive because the APC is governed by internal rules and procedures.\n\n\u2018\u2018When I leave here, I will stop at El-Rufai\u2019s house to ask him because I was not there\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018APC is the ruling party. We are driven by rules. The constitution of the APC is binding on all of us who are members and that is what we would follow. The Mr. President I know is a man that believes in the rule of law. I cannot see President Muhammadu Buhari supporting anything that is illegal, anything that is inconsistent with due process.\n\n\u2018\u2018I can tell you that all the things that are going on in the party\u2019s secretariat are going on with the knowledge of Mai Malam Buni and as soon as he comes back, he would take over the affairs of the party\u2019\u2019, noted the Imo State Governor who said it would be unfair to say that Governor Buni was not willing to conduct the convention.\n\n\u2018\u2018In our last meeting with Buni, he outlined all these activities and also informed us that he would be travelling for his medical and while he is there, Governor Bello is going to be there to do all that. The decision to swear in state chairmen was taken in the meeting and all of us were there.\n\nOn the crisis in Imo State, he said: \u2018\u2018I have said it times without number, I have publicly invited all my brothers and sisters, political leaders, business leaders, who for whatever reason, knowingly or unknowingly I have offended to come back. I am not taking anything personal but to look at the larger interest of our people and the development of the state.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have been doing quarterly stakeholders meetings since I assumed office as the governor of Imo State. It is to create a platform for stakeholders to express themselves, air their views, disappointment and give their recommendations in the areas we have not done well.\n\nAsked if he had extended the same olive branch to Senator Rochas Okorocha, he said: \u2018\u2018Of course! Several, privately and publicly. But you see, I don\u2019t want to adapt to the antics of a village woman or man who wants to dance naked by the market square. This platform is a public platform. But I know that I have invited every stakeholder.\n\n\u2018Okorocha is my brother by the way. You have to know that the seat he occupies now, is the seat I left in the Senate. All I am asking, even if I have done anything that has not gone down very well to him or any other person, forgive and forget all these, come let\u2019s develop the state.\n\nOn properties seized from Okorocha, Uzodinma explained: \u2018\u2018There is a judicial panel of inquiries set up by my predecessor and a white paper was approved and the matter has been implemented and if there is anything that was done in error, it is an opportunity for, noting that it was not his duty to act but due process should be allowed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",
          "summary": "The first time I ran for office, I ran for president.\nI have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job.\nThanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas.\nTell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world.\nYours truly,President Donald J.

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "title": "The untold story of how ThriveAgric survived a turbulent 2020",
          "text": "In September 2020, a few days after Muhammed Akinyemi didn\u2019t receive payment for a 6-month poultry cycle investment made in ThriveAgric, he informed his lawyer about this but didn\u2019t take legal action.\n\nHe was expecting the sum of \u20a6581,000 ($1,200) for the \u20a6510,000 he\u2019d invested in March. Akinyemi had also invested \u20a6200,000 in April, which was due (\u20a6224,000) in October.\n\n\u201cAt first, I just felt it\u2019s money, and it\u2019s with them. Whatever the problems are, within a week or two, they should resolve it,\u201d Akinyemi said. \u201cBut I found out that they hadn\u2019t addressed the issue to all their subscribers; rather they were explaining to individuals. And there was no specificity as to when it would be resolved.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later, Akinyemi\u2019s car broke down and he urgently needed money to fix it. ThriveAgric hadn\u2019t yet paid him and he was running out of patience. He was one out of hundreds of ThriveAgric\u2019s retail investors who hadn\u2019t received the payments.\n\nHis lawyer sent a warning notification to ThriveAgric, threatening to sue if the issue wasn\u2019t resolved. Akinyemi also put out a tweet calling out the company to fix the problem. He tried to rally around other retail investors who hadn\u2019t been paid, but a number of them didn\u2019t want any media attention.\n\n\u201cWe fought it from the legal and social aspect,\u201d said Akinyemi.\n\nOver 500km away, in Southwestern Nigeria Osun State, Esther*, a poultry farmer who partnered with ThriveAgric, had lost over 1,000 birds because there was little to no movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult period losing my birds in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Esther said. She was one out of many farmers within ThriveAgric\u2019s network who suffered massive losses.\n\nWhile the losses incurred varied among the farmers, depending on the capacity of their pens, ThriveAgric shared that there were over 400,000 mature birds that had no buyers. Despite efforts made by ThriveAgric to rent more cold rooms for storage of processed chickens, the lack of buyers and difficulty in moving the birds during the pandemic meant that over 90% of the birds were lost. The losses started happening as early as April 2020, until the end of the year.\n\nWith hundreds of unpaid, angry retail investors dragging ThriveAgric online, asking for their money, and farmers recording millions of naira in losses, this was ThriveAgric\u2019s darkest hour.\n\nFounded by Uka Eje (CEO) and Ayodeji Arikawe (CTO) in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers. It financed agriculture projects through crowdfunding. In the space of 3 years, ThriveAgric had grown to become a notable African Agritech startup, with backing from Y Combinator\u2014one of the world\u2019s most successful startup accelerators\u2014in 2019.\n\nHow did it get into this mess?\n\n\u201cIt was a mix of different events. The pandemic meant that offtakers couldn\u2019t pay for the goods we\u2019ve already supplied,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFarmers were also suffering losses in the farm, and we lost over 100 million naira worth of produce in transit because they were held up on the road. No movement during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for ThriveAgric was that its owing offtakers\u2014FMCGs and restaurant chains\u2014made repeated failed promises on when they\u2019d repay.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d promise to pay next week and, banking on their words because they hadn\u2019t defaulted before, we\u2019d in turn promise our retail investors that they\u2019ll be paid next week, only for the offtakers to go quiet,\u201d Eje said.\n\nThe offtakers too were anticipating that the pandemic would wind down and business activities would return, but it took longer than expected. This affected ThriveAgric\u2019s communication with its retail investors as it repeatedly failed to fulfil the promises it made to its retail investors. The fact that its large network of farmers were also experiencing losses also exacerbated the situation as ThriveAgric had invested in them by providing seeds and chicks, expecting to receive returns when they were sold. Many of those farmers haven\u2019t recovered from those losses till today.\n\nA popular question that came up during this period was whether ThriveAgric\u2019s claims to be covered by insurance were true. The company explained that the insurance covered the farming activities and not the retail investors\u2019 investment\u2014the logic being, if the farming process went well, the returns on the investment by the retail investors were guaranteed. Also, in this situation, the fact that farmers were unable to sell and the offtakers were owing weren\u2019t valid bases for requesting for insurance claims.\n\nAmerican serial entrepreneur Elon Musk once described the experience of running a startup as being similar to the act of chewing glass and staring into the abyss. \u201cAfter a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends,\u201d Musk said. ThriveAgric\u2019s experience validates this description.\n\nAll through this turbulent phase, the company maintains it didn\u2019t take its retail investors for granted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we realised was that this money we were owing was important for these people; for some it was house rent or school fees,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt was money that meant a lot to them. Regardless of how people reacted, it was their money, and they needed it back.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSalvaging the situation\n\nAs the situation escalated, different parties showed up to help out.\n\n\u201cWe stepped in as quickly as we got wind of the situation and did the best that we could at the time by guiding the team on the right approach to take, as well as by providing the practical support they needed in what was a very time-sensitive situation,\u201d said Kola Aina, General Partner, Ventures Platform, one of ThriveAgric\u2019s investors.\n\nVentures platform helped with recruiting an interim CEO, Adia Sowho, who was then VP of Growth and Managing Director, Nigeria, for credit platform Migo. It also restructured the finance and communications team.\n\nWhen ThriveAgric came knocking, the first question Sowho had to answer was \u201cDid she care enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question for me was, do I care enough about ThriveAgric and what it\u2019s doing? And am I willing, because I wasn\u2019t bored,\u201c Sowho said.\n\nWith the answer to that question being yes, in October Sowho agreed to step in, with Eje stepping down to the role of chief operating officer (COO).\n\n\u201cFood security is an important part of our economy. It doesn\u2019t get enough love and support as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cIf every Nigerian were a farmer, we\u2019d be feeding ourselves and the continent, which is literally ThriveAgric\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nSolving for Y\n\nTasked to initiate a turnaround in a new company and entirely different sector, the guiding principle Sowho turned to was first-principles thinking, a reverse engineering technique that has its origins from the teachings of Aristotle and has been made recently popular by leaders in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFor me, I tend to work with first principles. At the end of the day, whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, whether it\u2019s a startup, enterprise, or even conglomerate turnaround,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThey all involve the two or more parties exchanging value. With ThriveAgric there was an equation and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this hazy chain of unfulfilled agreement that just ended up in a crisis. And, of course, when it hits the public sphere, it makes the news.\u201d\n\nTo fix the broken equation, Sowho deployed three things: structure, governance, and documentation, concepts she claims startups tend to be wary of. The different teams and processes were restructured in order for the company to solve existing problems and be \u201c10 steps ahead of any risk before it materialises\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things I did were an outcome of the experience that I have working in building organisations,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen by accident. The success of any enterprise has to be by design.\u201d\n\nSowho and Eje worked on structuring the financing plan for the repayment of the retail investors and hiring for key roles. Alongside Sowho, a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a head of risk were hired. As the new hires got to work, stabilising the ship, co-founder and CTO Arikawe couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they joined the company at such a time.\n\n\u201cThese people joined us during the crisis. I was thinking, didn\u2019t you look up ThriveAgric online, a company that people are bashing, before joining,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nThe typical response from the new hires was that they believed in what the company was doing and were willing to put their names on the line.\n\n\u201cOur CFO joined us and 2 days later he\u2019s on a call where investors were insulting him,\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cA similar incident happened with Sowho, who joined and 1 week later had 300 angry people on a Zoom call with her.\u201d\n\nIn a few months, the presence of additional hands, fresh ideas, and the \u201cbridge\u201d capital (temporary financing) provided by Ventures Platform helped stabilise ThriveAgric.\n\nTransparency\u2014the currency of trust\n\nDuring this period, members of the support team and other departments had to work overnight for many days.\n\n\u201cEveryone was stretched but we had a lot of empathy for the people and also a sense of responsibility to ensure that things don\u2019t go wrong again,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nOn one of those nights, the engineering team in collaboration with the support team, decided to enhance transparency around the repayment schedule by creating a new payout dashboard\u2014Payout.thriveagric.com\u2014that reflected each retail investor\u2019s exact repayment date.\n\nThis was done to fix an issue with the initial payment dashboard which automatically indicated that the retail investors had been paid, as soon as it was due date. This feature caused retailer investors to be confused and angry, because they hadn\u2019t been paid.\n\n\u201cWhen we initially built the payout dashboard we didn\u2019t foresee a period like this where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay. People always got paid on or before payout day,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nWith the new payout dashboard, the retail investors could also see how many other people have been paid. A feature which the engineering team hoped would provide extra comfort and ease tension.\n\nUtilising the bridge loan secured, over the span of 9 months ThriveAgric was able to pay back the hundreds of customers it was owing. Akinyemi was paid in November and December 2020. ThriveAgric also repaid the bridge loan in 2021.\n\nUnexpected support and lessons\n\nDuring the turbulent period, there was a lot of pushback from retail investors but also surprisingly a lot of support from investors, financiers, and friends.\n\n\u201cI remember people calling and asking, what\u2019s the challenge, what do you need?\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cFor example, one of the people we sold birds to but hadn\u2019t paid called to apologise that he\u2019s trying his best. He was owing us because someone else was owing him.\u201d\n\nAfter 6 months at the helm of ThriveAgric, Sowho left to join telecom giant MTN Nigeria as its first-ever female Chief Marketing Officer while Eje returned to the position of CEO. During his time as COO, Eje worked on ensuring that repayment and communications with different stakeholders happened seamlessly.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I ensured that the core business operations ran smoothly and built a system to ensure that the defaulting offtakers paid,\u201d Eje said. \u201cI also identified other funding opportunities outside crowdfunding.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on her experience, she said, \u201cYou often wonder whether you can hack it with a turnaround, and I did, so that\u2019s one thing I learned. Now people are calling me the queen of turnaround after one event.\u201d\n\nAnother valuable lesson for Sowho was how she was able to manage her productivity considering that she joined ThriveAgric during the pandemic and managed things virtually.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how focused I could be, because I\u2019m one of those people that like to do everything all the time, all at once,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cBut I think in this situation, the urgency required that I stay very focused.\u201d\n\nThere were ThriveAgric team members she didn\u2019t meet until about 2\u20133 months into the job, because she was very focused on talking to the people nearest to this issue.\n\nFor the team at ThriveAgric, the incident was a learning moment for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning to scale with structure. Right now as we explore different opportunities, we look at the risks and how to scale sustainably,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re still certain about what we want to do. It\u2019s still day one.\u201d\n\nKola Aina believes the incident was a reminder as an investor that \u201csupporting companies through difficult times is one of the truest forms of portfolio support.\u201d\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nThriveAgric has since paused crowdfunding from retail investors to focus on institutional investors. Since the pivot, ThriveAgric has sealed investment partnerships with several commercial banks, the CBN, World Food Program, and USAID. Its landmark partnership came recently in the form of a one-year project in partnership with USAID-backed West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub).\n\nThe partnership, which aims to empower at least 50,000 farmers across Nigeria, will be supported with a $1.75 million co-investment grant from Trade Hub. The startup is also focusing on building out its farmer-centred technology solutions which currently serves over 200,000 farmers. The company\u2019s focus is to build the largest network of profitable farmers across Africa.\n\n\u201cAgritech is not just about having a website and asking people for money,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building the infrastructure that supports the food production value chain.\u201d\n\nSultan Quadri contributed to this story.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigeria facing unprecedented budget deficit, surging inflation says EIU",
          "text": "Analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU say Nigeria\u2019s fiscal situation will worsen considerably this year under the weight of soaring energy prices which should otherwise have been a blessing, with budget deficit rising to six per cent of gross domestic product, GDP and inflation surging past sixteen per cent.\n\n\u201cWe will revise up our inflation projection of 13.7% in 2022, probably to within the 15-16% range, to account for global supply shocks,\u201d the analysts said in their report published Tuesday. \u201dWe will also modify our fiscal deficit forecast for 2022, from 4.5% of GDP to about 6%, which would be the highest since the 1990s.\u201d\n\nThe situation of Nigeria is being compounded by \u201cunderwhelming crude oil production, of about 1.3m barrels/day on average over the past 12 months (which is 400,000 barrels shy of Nigeria\u2019s current OPEC+ target production quota, owing to disinvestment and theft), has been netting out recent price gains.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s current oil production level is now half what it was in 1992, hobbled by a woeful management of the industry by government. Shell, the anglo-dutch energy giant which produced about 900,000 barrels of oil in 1992 has seen its production fall to a mere 200,000 barrels today.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cNigeria is encountering a mini-crisis regarding petrol. In early February the authorities withdrew adulterated petrol from circulation, after it emerged that an unsanctioned blend was causing the breakdown of motor vehicles and shutdowns of emergency power-generation equipment.\n\n\u201cPetrol grew scarce, and the regulated price became hard to manage. Nigeria\u2019s state oil firm, NNPC Limited, raced to fill the gap, but Russia invaded Ukraine shortly after, exacerbating Nigeria\u2019s fuel-supply crisis. Surging energy prices since the conflict began are inflaming price expectations and motivating speculative behaviour, including hoarding.\u201d\n\nThe precarious situation of the continent\u2019s largest economy is also a drag of the growth of the private sector and a pain in the neck of ordinary Nigerians.\n\nBrent crude oil prices breached the $130/barrel mark in early March, raising the prices of fuel products like diesel and petrol in tandem. Most Nigerian firms and businesses rely on stand-by diesel generators for electricity supply.\n\nRead also: Russia-Ukraine conflict adds to MPC\u2019s inflation headache\n\nOver the last one month, diesel prices, which are not regulated like petrol, rose by more than two-folds to as high as N625 (US$1.5)/litre in the first week of March, and there is little sign of relief any time soon as the Russian-Ukrainian war weighs on global supply chains.\n\nRegulated petrol prices have become volatile too, reportedly rising unofficially to as high as N220/litre as fuel marketers impose varying premiums under the counter on the regulated price of N165/litre.\n\nAnnual inflation stood at 15.6% year in year in January, unchanged from the December rate. In 2021 there was a general trend towards disinflation. Recent developments indicate renewed upward inflationary pressure in 2022, although increases will be limited by petrol prices staying anchored near the official price.\n\nThe EIU report said, \u201cthe authorities\u2019 planned fuel subsidy bill of N3trn (US$7.2bn) for 2022 could be nearly twice as much by end-2022, if Brent crude oil prices remain elevated (we expect US$116/b in 2022).\n\nAn upwardly revised fiscal deficit projection of 4.9% of GDP for 2022 by the authorities, owing to the continuation of fuel subsidy, could easily rise to as high as 6% of GDP as the government insists on footing the burgeoning bill to avoid a political backlash ahead of a crucial general election in 2023. Ideally, higher crude oil prices should boost the public purse.\u201d",

          "title": "Power outage deepening Nigerians\u2019 woes",
          "text": "Nigerian households and businesses have been hard hit by a double whammy of a lingering fuel crisis and worsening power outage, with economic activities being crippled across vital sectors.\n\nIn Abuja, private and public offices, including the Federal Secretariat, which houses most of the Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs), had resorted to spending huge funds on alternative power sources, especially generators, amid high petrol and diesel prices.\n\nBusinessDay reliably gathered on Monday that the nation\u2019s seat of power \u2013 Aso Rock Presidential Villa \u2013 was not spared from blackout as it ran on power generators for most of the day.\n\nThis comes at a time President Muhammadu Buhari is vacating in London for a medical check-up.\n\nA Presidency source told BusinessDay that the State House Conference Centre had been running on diesel-powered generators in recent times.\n\n\u201cPeople are complaining about power supply. The Presidential Villa is not different; the place runs on generators daily,\u201d the source said.\n\nAccording to the source, the power system is run by Julius Berger staff, which also supplies diesel fuel for the generator.\n\nWhen contacted, Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the President on media and publicity, referred one of our reporters to the recent media briefing addressed by Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power.\n\n\u201cThe minister just briefed you last week. I have nothing new to tell you for now; no, nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinessDay observed that several ministries at the Federal Secretariat, Abuja were in partial or total blackout.\n\nCivil servants, who were seen idle in their offices, said they could not execute their tasks due to the power outage, and that activities had generally slowed down.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the blackout at these ministries could last for up to 20 hours a day.\n\nAt the office of the head of civil service, it was gathered that there was a severe power outage throughout last week. A staff member, who, at about 1pm, had already closed for the day and was on her way home, said she had not been able to do anything since resuming work Monday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything. We can\u2019t make payments, make orders or any transaction,\u201d she lamented.\n\nAnother staff member said, \u201cThe light situation is a complete mess. No light at home, no light at work. Last week, there was no light from Monday to Friday at the service; currently there is no light. Whenever they decide to bring the light, it\u2019s usually very late, when workers have already closed.\u201d\n\nRead also: Power cuts exposes Nigeria\u2019s diesel-dependent economy\n\nAt the Ministry of Health, including the office of the minister, there was a complete blackout. A staff member at one of the departments said the light situation had been unreliable. \u201cThe situation even crippled a meeting at the minister\u2019s conference room and nothing happened,\u201d he said.\n\nAn official at the SERVICOM department in the ministry said, \u201cThis light situation is worse now. They brought the light very briefly this morning, and we won\u2019t see this light till tomorrow. It\u2019s affecting our work seriously. The offices are not conducive to work due to the heat and that\u2019s why you see us standing here. I work with the Servicom office; just look at the entire building, there is no light.\u201d\n\nThe situation is no different at the Ministry of Education. \u201cWork has stopped because the light situation has been very very bad, and the generator can only power the first to third floor. From the fourth floor upward has no light,\u201d a staff member told BusinessDay.\n\nAt phase one of the Federal Secretariat, workers lamented the same issue. An administrative officer at the Office of the Secretary of the Government of the Federation, who identified himself as Mr Friday, said, \u201cThe situation has persisted for close to two months and is causing a lot of problems and confusion. The worst part is that they take it during work hours and bring it mostly at night when it\u2019s basically useless.\u201d\n\nBusinessDay also learnt that the National Assembly had been running mostly on a generator in recent weeks due to poor power supply.\n\nRecently, a panel of the House of Representatives investigating \u201calleged cases of indiscriminate and unlawful administrative charges on contracts and percentage charges on projects implementation by MDAs\u201d had its activities stalled by blackout.\n\nThe power outage, which lasted for more than 45 minutes, led to an abrupt halt of the proceedings at the Committee Room 414 of the House wing, forcing the lawmakers to vacate the venue angrily.\n\nBut as the situation persists, authorities continue to trade blame on who and what is responsible for the worsening power outage across the country which has seen businesses crumbling and Nigerians suffer terrible heat waves.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Aliyu, power minister, blamed the situation on low hydro capacity during dry season and maintenance work at gas plants.\n\n\u201cI would like to discuss the increased load shedding you may have observed in Abuja and other areas in the country. With the reduction in hydro capacity during the dry season, additional load needs to be taken up by our gas plants,\u201d he had said.\n\nLast week, Aliyu blamed the situation on a myriad of issues, including poor gas delivery, poor access to forex insufficient/weak transmission infrastructure to adequately evacuate/wheel power, and issues of Right of Way, among others.\n\nHe also accused the MDAs of non-payment of electricity bills as contributing to the huge debt profile of the power distribution companies (DisCos).\n\nTransmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), in its reaction, said the nation-wide load shedding was as a result of very low power generation by the generation companies (GenCos) for it to wheel through the transmission grid to the DisCos nationwide.\n\nBut in a reaction to TCN\u2019s claims, the Gencos said the N1.644 trillion owed them by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET) was crippling their operations.\n\nJoy Ogaji, executive secretary of Association of Power Generation Companies, who addressed a press conference, said the amount was as a result of accumulated unused capacity, which spread through 2015 to 2022.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the power minister was convening an emergency meeting with all power sector stakeholders to find solutions to the problem.\n\nWhile the blame game continues, experts warn of the negative economic consequences of this development for inflation and output growth, especially coupled with the impact of shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nThey noted that businesses \u2013 mostly the small ones \u2013 had continued to suffer escalating costs, and some of them would hardly survive the next week if the situation persisted.\n\nLast week, BusinessDay witnessed how Jane and her husband, Thomas, who jointly run a hair and nail salon around the very popular Wuse market, ran a generator to service their customers all through last week Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe light situation has been horrible for the most of three weeks now,\u201d Jane said.\n\nAlso, Elizabeth Chirkpi, a resident of APO Area of Abuja and CEO of Cacia Concept, lamented that it had been unbearable for her to run her home and business as a result of the power outage.\n\nChirkpi told BusinessDay that she had to buy fuel from black marketers to power her home and shop to avoid wastage of foodstuff and to keep her business moving, saying her expenses had tripled.\n\n\u201cI must say that it has not been funny. At home, one can hardly sleep and you know what that means to someone that is working.\u201d\n\nJohn Umar, an Abuja-based financial analyst, said, \u201cThe concern really is of a possible higher inflationary pressures in the next couple of months as households and businesses dependency on petrol and diesel have increased significantly in the last month.\n\n\u201cThis significant rise in fuel costs, in addition to the lingering fuel scarcity, will cause a significant rise in utility costs. Given that the utility sub-basket constitutes 32.6 percent of the core inflation, core inflation may likely continue to rise in the short term.\u201d\n\nHe said the increase in commodity prices as a result of the current poor power situation and high fuel costs would have a negative pass-through effect on food prices from higher transport costs.\n\nFood inflation has been one major driver of headline inflation in the last five years. The last couple of months witnessed a decline in food Inflation and by extension headline inflation.\n\nUmar said, \u201cHowever, should this current mix of power epilepsy and high petrol cost persist, we could see food inflation rising as high as 19-20 percent, with headline inflation settling at 17-18 percent in the medium term as a result.\n\n\u201cBusinesses would be hit the hardest as initial budgets might have to be restructured as the current price increase of commodities would leave them at the mercy of either shutting down or transferring the cost to the general economy via their customer base.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with BusinessDay, Odutayo Oluseyi, assistant director of press for the power ministry, said efforts were ongoing to resolve the electricity issues across the country.\n\n\u201cJust as the government has said before, we are having issues with power generation, but it will soon be over because necessary actions are being taken by all relevant agencies,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "Nigerian households and businesses have been hard hit by a double whammy of a lingering fuel crisis and worsening power outage, with economic activities being crippled across vital sectors.\nCivil servants, who were seen idle in their offices, said they could not execute their tasks due to the power outage, and that activities had generally slowed down.\nAt the office of the head of civil service, it was gathered that there was a severe power outage throughout last week.\nAn official at the SERVICOM department in the ministry said, \u201cThis light situation is worse now.\nAt the time of filing this report, the power minister was convening an emergency meeting with all power sector stakeholders to find solutions to the problem.",

The result was the significant stranded capacity of GenCos, which ironically, Nigerians are in dire need of but cannot get,\u201d Ogaji said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the blame game, the Nigerian consumers who saw their electricity tariff rise over 35 percent in 2020 upon the introduction of the service-based tariff plan, are complaining of being short-changed.\n\n\u201cPaying bills under the service-based tariff is contractual, and there should be consequences for the breach of such contracts,\u201d said Adetayo Adegbemle.\n\n\u201cDoes the FG, regulators (NERC) or Discos have any mechanism to compensate consumers who are paying based on power supply bands they never received?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) says it remains committed to protecting electricity consumers from failure to deliver on committed service levels under the service-based tariff regime.\n\nBusinessDay contacted NERC but it had yet to provide a response as of the time of filing this report.\n\n\u201cYou stock up on food to avoid severe inflation only for epileptic power supply and total grid collapse to make a total mockery of your efforts \u2026 and you can\u2019t even find fuel to buy to power your private generator,\u201d Babajide Ewuoso said in a tweet.",

It\u2019s that risk we try to mitigate by encouraging them not to migrate through the Sahara Desert.\n\n\u201cWe accepted the problem facing us and set up a taskforce to deal with the problem. We took up the responsibility of resettling returnees, tackling the root cause of the problem, dealing with perpetrators and understanding migration in the context of development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that what is happening in the country today and the very difficult economic situation that is emerging will put pressure on young people to want to travel again. I don\u2019t believe that our response should be the same as we did in Migration 1.0 as we may not be able to prevent irregular migration,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cOur strategy for Migration 2.0 is to work with destination countries and the federal government to look for pathways for regular migration. Post-COVID-19, a lot of the destination countries require labour and we have no excuse not to prepare our people properly to migrate safely.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss with the Italian Ambassador as we strategize on how to prepare and structure proper labour contracts, train and prepare our people to travel and do their job regularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Migration 2.0, we would expect you to work closely with us to look at the data we have and support some other intervention programmes that we have. Migration 2.0 for us, is that every player in the spectrum needs to sit across the table with us to enable us to know what you are doing and how to optimise resources together to strengthen our partnership, reducing waste and achieving more,\u201d Obaseki noted\n\nReassuring that his government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow them to achieve their fullest potentials, Obaseki further stated, \u201cIn Edo State, we will encourage our women to come up and be part of the political process to ensure we have equal female representation in the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with the representation in the executive and judiciary. Our task is to make sure that in Edo State, our women have due representation in the legislature.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Dankabo commended Obaseki commended Obaseki for his affirmative action for women in his cabinet and the government\u2019s commitment to the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor has described the personal attacks by his Rivers State counterpart, Hon. Nyesom Wike against his Deputy, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu as \u201cmost unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the governor called on the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to call to order, noting that the issues raised by his deputy were germane and needed to be resolved in the interest of the party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe recent personal attacks by His Excellency, the Governor of Rivers State, Rt. Hon. Nyesom Wike, against my Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu is, to say the least, most unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Wike was one who is wont to show respect and courtesy to his colleague-governors, he would have ordinarily reached out to me to express his concerns about the views made by my deputy governor, rather than embarking on this unwarranted public onslaught.\n\n\u201cMy deputy governor was a former National President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and his comment is representative of the essence of the nation\u2019s youth population, who are inclined to openly speak up and question the status quo. If Governor Wike cannot understand and adequately respond to the style and character of the Nigerian youth, how can he aspire to lead them?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Governor Wike should have taken a cue from the manner in which the National Chairman of our party, Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, responded to my deputy\u2019s remarks, as a conscientious leader who is able to show empathy and consideration.\n\n\u201cThe concerns expressed by my deputy governor bordered on pertinent issues affecting the PDP in Edo State which since the September 19th 2020 elections, has been able to register over 500,000 members; and till date, these new members have not been properly integrated into our party after two years.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAlso, the leaders, executives and members who came with me into the party have still not been accepted, integrated or harmonized into the party.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the fact that old members of Edo PDP, who are open to inclusion and supportive of building a large party are being vilified and ostracized by a cabal purportedly led by Chief Dan Orbih, who is your perpetual guest in Port Harcourt and is remotely used to orchestrate the destabilization of the party in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to recall at this point that a political solution gave rise to the emergence of Chief Dan Orbih first as Acting and then as Substantive National Vice Chairman, South South, of our party, when Chief Emma Odidi resigned that position to allow Chief Orbih to ascend.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore curious why this type of political solution is no longer tenable to resolve the political impasse in Edo State PDP.\n\n\u201cWe can categorically state that in the comments of the deputy governor, he at no point threatened the party as Governor Wike has alleged. Rather, it is Governor Wike, who has at different times, threatened the PDP. Some of these instances include:\n\n1. On September 16, 2018, Governor Wike threatened the party that there would be grave consequences if it moved the National Convention from Port Harcourt in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.\n\n2. On September 12, 2019, Governor Wike also threatened to cause trouble for the party over the emergence of Hon. Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nNoting that Governor Wike has contributed to the advancement of the party, just like others, since 1999, he stressed: \u201cNo one is against his desire to run for president, however, his ambition should not be embarked on in such a way that it would cause disruption at different levels, such as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum as well as different chapters of the party across the country.\n\n\u201cIt clearly amounts to delusion of grandeur, for any one man to nurse the idea that he owns or has more stake in the PDP and everyone should pander to him.\n\n\u201cWe are all equal stakeholders in the party and an aggregate of the ideas, opinions and contributions of all leaders and members should form the position of the party and not the view of one individual or a select few.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Wike is free to use his resources as he deems fit in pursuit of his ambition, he should not attempt to cow, intimidate, cajole and threaten others into doing his bidding. Edo State cannot and will not be procured for anyone\u2019s personal ambition.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs now are strong democratic institutions and not strong men; that is why we will join the great leaders of our party across the country to build PDP into a strong, large and indomitable party that will win next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike and his collaborators headed by Chief Dan Orbih in Edo State will not succeed in destabilizing the PDP in Edo State as they did other states like Cross River just to secure delegates to actualize his alleged personal ambition to run for presidency in 2023.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cIn Edo, we don\u2019t accept political bullies and overlords and historically, we have demonstrated our capacity to unshackle ourselves and dethrone bullies and highhanded leaders.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all well-meaning leaders of our great party to call Governor Wike to order to desist from his current unguarded and disruptive tendencies. From all indications today, PDP is set to take over the leadership of Nigeria provided we can rein in the self interest of a few leaders to put the task of rescuing Nigeria above their personal ambitions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s global bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has assured its shareholders and investors of excellent performance in the 2022 financial year, as the bank continues to deepen its foothold to reap the benefits of its investments in strong and innovative digital product offerings and expanded scope over the past few years.\n\nThe Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, Kennedy Uzoka, noted that, together with its diversified business model and keen ventures into key markets in Africa and beyond, investors of the bank will enjoy huge financial benefits and dividends in the current financial year and beyond.\n\nUzoka said this during the Investors/Analysts Conference Call at the bank\u2019s Head Office in Lagos, following the release of its results for the full year ended December 31, 2021. He explained that UBA\u2019s diversification model remains one of its best growth strategies as seen from the huge contribution of its subsidiaries into the business in the last financial year.\n\n\u201cConsidering the significant investment the bank has made over the years across the globe \u2013 this is about $105 million in 20 African countries, United Kingdom, France and the United Arab Emirates, and the fact that UBA is the only Sub-Saharan bank with a deposit-taking license in the United States of America \u2013 We are indeed beginning to reap the benefits of our investments. It is expected that, as the operations continue to grow, the bank will be able to realise the full benefits of its investments in multiples and will thereby, deliver much higher dividend returns to shareholders in the years ahead,\u201d Uzoka told the investors.\n\nBreaking down the full year 2021 financial results to the investors, Uzoka pointed out that gross earnings rose significantly to N660.2 billion representing an increase of 7 percent compared to N616.8 billion recorded at the end of the 2020 financial year, whilst total assets grew by 11 percent to an unprecedented N8.5 trillion in the year under review, up from N7.7 trillion in 2020, marking the first time the Bank\u2019s assets will cross the N8 trillion mark.\n\nUBA\u2019s Profit Before Tax was impressive with a 20.3 percent growth to N153.1 billion, compared to N127.3 billion at the end of the 2020 financial year as Profit After Tax rose by 8.7 percent to N118.7 billion in 2021, compared to N109.2 billion recorded the previous year. As a result, the Bank proposed a total dividend of N1.00, comprising an interim dividend of 20 kobo, already paid, and a final dividend of 80 kobo, to be presented to shareholders for approval at the 60th Annual General Meeting scheduled for April 7, 2022.\n\nContinuing, the GMD explained that the quality of UBA staff, its portfolio, as well as the strength of the bank\u2019s credit risk management frameworks and policies, remain the bedrock of the positive and sustained results of the bank, adding that \u201cOur current performance highlights our customer focus leveraging on our three levers, which are: people, process and technology; and so we see that as a well-diversified financial institution, UBA remains very strongly capitalised to take advantage of opportunities in the future.\u201d\n\nUBA\u2019s Group Chief Finance Officer, Ugo Nwaghodoh, who also responded to questions at the conference call assured investors that the bank is committed to further strengthening its payments infrastructure to fully absorb the growing clientele in the digital space.\n\n\u201cOur records show a very well-diversified loan book across various critical sectors across the economies in which we operate and the diversification is in both industry sectors, across geographies and customer segments. We are reinforcing our digital banking and payment offerings as we continue to see a stronger proportion of non-interest income to total income in the days ahead,\u201d Nwaghodoh said.\n\nUnited Bank for Africa Plc is Africa\u2019s global bank with a presence in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France and more recently the United Arab Emirates.

          "text": "Figures from latest report by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that rice, a stable food in the country, and bread, have recorded significant hike in prices over the last five years.\n\nA year-on-year analysis of the average prices from January 2017 to January 2022 based on data from the NBS shows that bread (unsliced, 500g) and rice (agric-sold loose rice) recorded 42 per cent and 48 per cent price hikes, respectively.\n\nThe figures show that as of January 2017, the average price of a loaf of bread (unsliced, 500g) was N270. But it increased to N384 by January 2022.\n\nThere was also an increase in the price of sliced bread (500g) from N303 as of January 2017 to N419 as of January 2022.\n\nThe average cost of 1kg of rice (agric-sold loose rice) was N324 as of January 2017. It, however, increased to N481 by January 2022.\n\nThere was also an increase in the price of locally sold loose rice, medium-grained rice, and imported high quality sold loose rice (1kg each) from N286, N312, and N402 as of January 2017 to N430, N477, and N579 as of January 2022, respectively.\n\nThis was despite the drop in recorded overall inflation from 18.72 per cent as of January 2017 to 15.60 per cent as of January 2022.\n\nThe 15.60 per cent was still, however, higher than the 13 per cent inflation target of the Federal Government for 2022.\n\nThe Federal Government has projected an inflation rate of 13 per cent in its key projections and assumptions for the 2022 budget.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, had disclosed this during her presentation of this year\u2019s approved budget recently, PUNCH reported.\n\nShe had said, \u201cInflation is projected to be double-digit in the medium-term given structural issues impacting the cost of doing business, including high food distribution cost. However, the current steady decline is expected to be sustained, seeing the inflation rate drop to 13 per cent in 2022 and 10 per cent by 2024.\u201d\n\nThe country is, however, still struggling with double-digit inflation, with the World Bank projecting that Nigeria may record one of the highest inflation rates globally in 2022, with increasing prices diminishing the welfare of Nigerian households.\n\nAccording to the Washington-based bank in its Nigeria Development Update report, Nigeria may have the seventh-highest inflation rate among sub-Saharan African countries in 2022.\n\nThe CBN had projected last year that the country\u2019s inflation rate would drop to a single digit in 2022, with the full implementation of its recent policies designed to boost different sectors of the economy.\n\nHowever, the World Bank had said that the Federal Government of Nigeria did not take any concerted action towards curbing inflation in 2021 despite inflation shock pushing an estimated eight million Nigerians below the poverty line.\n\nThe report read in part, \u201cDouble-digit inflation rates are depressing economic activity and exacerbating poverty. Rising food prices are eroding household purchasing power, and we estimate that during 2020 and 2021, the \u2018inflation shock\u2019 alone pushed about eight million more Nigerians below the poverty line.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cWithout decisive action, the average inflation rate for 2021 will exceed that for 2020 and will be unlikely to approach the CBN\u2019s target range of 6\u20139 per cent by end-2022.\n\n\u201cThe inflation rate has not fallen to nine per cent since 2014, but in a hypothetical scenario where the inflation rate would have been close to the CBN\u2019s goal of 9 per cent in 2020 and 2021, the consumption level of the average Nigerian would have been at least 15 per cent higher today.\u201d\n\nAside from the World Bank, a United States-based magazine, Global Finance, had said the CBN failed to curb rising inflation and stop the naira from sliding against the United States dollar.",

Eni\u2019s relates to Brass crude cargoes and follows a pipeline blast in Bayelsa State.\n\nForce majeure is a legal step that allows companies not to meet contractual obligations for reasons that are out of their control.\n\nShipments of the two grades had been planned at a rate of 170,000 barrels a day next month but have been in a state of decline over the past few years, according to loading programs seen by Bloomberg. Flows back in 2020 were planned at about 320,000 barrels a day.\n\nA force majeure doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the entirety of supply will be lost for a given period of time. Stored cargoes could still be shipped and repairs would allow shipments to resume.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe market is closely watching what will happen to Russian oil supply in the wake of the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Some oil companies have stopped buying new cargoes from Moscow and some governments have announced that they were imposing bans on petroleum imports from Russia.\n\nShell has said it will try to go elsewhere for barrels.\n\nThe lost shipments could be significant for Nigeria.

          "title": "APC crisis: Why 19 governors\u2019 position will prevail \u2013 Ndume",
          "text": "Despite President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s intervention, there are indications that the festering leadership crisis bedevilling the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee(CECPC) of the All Progressives Party may be far from over.\n\nIndication to this emerged Monday when a major stakeholder in the party and lawmaker representing Borno South in the National Assembly, Senator Ali Ndume said the position of the 19 governors on the CECPC would prevail at the end of the day.\n\nAt the height of the botched leadership change which heralded in Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello as acting chair of the CECPC, Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai declared 19 governors were in support of Sani-Bello.\n\nHe also said the choice of Sani-Bello had Buhari\u2019s blessing, indicating that the deal had been sealed.\n\nEl-Rufai said Governor Mai Mala Buni\u2019s actions were hindrances to plan to hold its convention on March 26.\n\nAccording to him, 19 of the 23 governors elected on the ticket of the party were on same page on the mission to prevent the party from collapsing.\n\nBut he was silent on the four governors that were not with them.\n\nThe London meeting\n\nBut at a meeting with some select ministers and other stakeholders, led by Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) in London Saturday, President Buhari scolded the el-Rufai group and directed that the Yobe state governor be returned as the caretaker committee chair.\n\nAt the said meeting, the president was also reported to have said he was not backing any candidate for the position of the national chairman of the party.\n\nNdume speaks\n\nBut weighing in Monday while featuring on Arise TV monitored by Ripples Nigeria, Senator Ndume said the position of the anti-Buni governors would ultimately prevail.\n\nThe lawmaker said the actions of the governors, allegedly in support of the emergence of Sani-Bello as the CECPC head, would be ratified for the betterment of the party.\n\nSpeaking during the interview, Ndume said: \u201cWhen we have 19 people on one side, the voice of the majority will prevail and have its way. The President is the leader of our party and as I said, the 19 Governors seem not to prefer Buni and we cannot afford to go into the elections with a divided house. This issue will be resolved eventually with the inclusion of the other four Governors.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, however, expressed worry over the internal wrangling within the ruling party and praised President Buhari for his intervention.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in the APC is worrisome but this is not unusual due to political interests \u2014 the problem is that the interest of some individuals overrode the party but the President intervened.\n\n\u201cThe statement made by President Buhari will get everyone into line for the betterment of the party. The President expects everyone to do the right thing but he stood up before the issues degenerate.\n\n\u201cVarious persons have shown interest in the party leadership, and the party will vote by consensus, direct or indirect. The interested candidate depends on where the chairmanship is zoned to, but I am not sure whether it has been zoned to North Central. My best candidate is to have someone that cannot be manipulated, who is a leader and father to all in order to take decisions on what is better for the party,\u201d Ndume said.0y\u0165\n\nOn the issue of zoning, the lawmaker said: \u201cIn fairness, the South must present the next President and it is left to those zones to produce.\u201d\n\nEx-PGF boss Lukman\n\nIn a related development, the immediate past Director General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and a chieftain of the ruling APC, Salihu Moh Lukman, has called for a painstaking background checks on all the aspirants contesting at the forthcoming national convention of the party.\n\nLukman said the quality of party leaders would substantially determine the quality of candidates the party would present for elections in 2023.\n\nIn a statement Lukman released Monday in Abuja, he said starting with the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention, APC leaders, especially governors should demonstrate stronger commitment towards recruiting tested and trustworthy leaders.\n\n\u201cWe must appeal to all APC leaders, especially Governors, to recognise that the weight of political responsibility of producing new leaders for the APC is in fact a very strong test of whether the party can continue to justifiably earn the confidence of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWill leaders, especially Governors, undertake the crucial task of performing background checks for aspiring candidates and dispassionately, even if painfully, select both party leaders and party candidates for elections, beyond issues of loyalty? The crucial task before APC leaders is to ensure that leadership selection process produce trustworthy leaders both as party leaders and as candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cOnce party leaders make the mistake of producing Bureau De Change managers as APC leaders during the March 26, 2022 National Convention, the probability will be very high that there will be many bad eggs emerging as standard bearers of the party for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cAlready PDP leaders have dug their political grave when for instance they elected people who shared $2.1 billion meant for arms procurement to fight insecurity as National leaders of the PDP,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Lukman, \u201copposition PDP leaders continue to arrogantly and contemptuously ignore this foundational reality of public trust in politics. This is among many other factors why the PDP is still very unpopular among Nigerians. APC must fundamentally take every step necessary to produce new orientation for political leadership recruitment in the country as we approach the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs much as possible, situations whereby good leaders only emerge \u2018accidentally\u2019 must begin to be reversed in Nigeria based on carefully planned initiatives under the APC. As part of the process of planning for the emergence of trustworthy leaders, issues of getting current leaders to account for their actions or inactions will be nec\u201dAPC, as a party, needs to also take a special interest in what is going on in Kogi State. It is embarrassing that a government produced by the party will demonstrate that level of rascality. If PDP can tolerate such public rascality as was the case under for instance the inglorious era of Ayodele Fayose in Ekiti and many other PDP state governments across the country, APC must decisively disown what is coming out of Kogi State under Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cIf necessary, APC should declare opposition to what is emerging as the governance credentials of Governor Yahaya Bello, including taking every necessary step to save the people of Kogi State from the influence of Yahaya Bello in determining who succeeds him.\n\n\u201cEvery step must be taken to ensure that APC emerges as a distinctively different party from PDP and other parties especially on the question of leadership recruitment. While in the case of PDP and other parties, issues of leadership recruitment are considered as given based on the received wisdoms of political leaders, in APC these issues are being debated and contested, which explains all the dynamics around the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention.\n\n\u201cIf anything, the contest for the emergence of trustworthy political leaders in APC is a contest for the unfettered development of Nigerian democracy. Nigerian democracy cannot develop unless the right conditions within parties are created for the emergence of trustworthy leaders both as party leaders and candidates for election.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s epileptic power supply Monday worsened as the national grid suffered yet another collapse, plunging many homes into further darkness.\n\nAffected by the system collapse are Lagos, Enugu, Kaduna, Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo states among several others.\n\nBefore now, there had been a drastic drop in the supply of electricity to various homes and businesses across the country.\n\nThe grid, which is being managed by the government-owned Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), has continued to suffer system collapse over the years amid a lack of spinning reserve meant to forestall such occurrences.\n\nTaking to its social media handle Monday to announce the collapse, Eko Electricity Distribution Plc, one of the nation\u2019s distribution companies, disclosed that the grid collapsed at 10:40am Monday.\n\nIt wrote on its Twitter handle: \u201cDear esteemed customer, we regret to inform you of a total system collapse on the national grid at 10:40 am today, leading to outages across our network. We are closely monitoring the situation with our TCN partners to determine the cause and a timeline for resolution.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely apologise for the inconvenience as we will keep you updated on the situation, Thank you for your understanding.\u201d\n\nAnother DisCo, Jos Electricity Distribution Plc, also announced on its Twitter handle to its customers: \u201cThere is power outage in all our franchise states due to system collapse nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe will provide an update shortly. Thank you for bearing with us.\u201d\n\nThe situation was not different in Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc, which, via its twitter handle, confirmed the collapse.\n\nEEDC Head Corporate Communications Emeka Ezeh said they were waiting for feedback.\n\n\u201cThe Enugu Electricity Distribution Plc (EEDC) wishes to inform her esteemed customers in the South East of a general system collapse which occurred this morning, Monday, 14th March, 2022 at 10:40 am.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason for the loss of supply currently being experienced across the network. Consequently, all our outgoing feeders are out and supply to our customers in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, and Imo States are affected by this development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on standby and awaiting a signal from the National Control Centre (NCC) for restoration of supply,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAlso, the Kaduna Electricity confirmed the system collapse, but assured its customers that power would soon be restored.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that the power outage being experienced in our franchise states is due to System Collapse of the National Grid which occurred at about 10:40 am,\u201d the firm said.\n\n\u201cPower supply shall be restored as soon as the National Grid is powered back. Our sincere apologies for any inconvenience,\u201d the text message read.\n\nBlame game\n\nMeanwhile, Executive Secretary Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC) Dr. Joy Ogaji has blamed the general system collapse on the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET).\n\nOgaji said this was so because NBET refused to fulfil its obligations to the GenCos as contained in the Power Purchase Agreements (PPA).\n\nIn a detailed breakdown, the APGC said NBET owed the GenCos N214.93 billion in 2015; N273.32 billion in 2016; N236.47 in 2017, N264.08 billion in 2018, and N256.97 billion, N266.01 billion and N120.25 billion in 2019,2020 and 2021 respectively.\n\nConsequently, Ogaji said the humongous debt had hampered the ability of the GenCos to function optimally regarding maintenance and power distribution, while clarifying that if the debts were paid, the GenCos could generate 9,000MW immediately.\n\nBut Head Corporate Communication NBET Henrietta Ighomrore explained that only five power generation companies with active Gas Purchase Agreement were paid for unused capacity.\n\nAccording to her, claims by Ogaji that the GenCos had the capacity to generate 9,000MW were not accurate as inspections by NBET showed the capacity never existed.\n\nMinister meets GenCos, others\n\nAnd in a quick response to the development, Minister of Power Abubakar Aliyu summoned an emergency meeting with stakeholders in the power sector.\n\nAt the meeting, the minister said there was the need for stakeholders to work together to address the deteriorating power situation across the country.\n\nThe meeting had in attendance officials of GenCos, DisCos, TCN and NBET. Others are the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Shell and others in the power value chain.\n\n\u201cThis meeting was summoned to address the current electricity situation in the country which we are not happy about.\n\n\u201cWe must find a solution so that Nigerians will have electricity. I want us to have the patience to talk to each other, not blame each other,\u201d Aliyu said.\n\nThe minister pledged government\u2019s readiness to ensure power stability across Nigeria.\n\n",

          "text": "Dr. Clement Vhirerhire, the first pathologist, to conduct an autopsy on the body of late Sylvester Oromoni has testified about his findings before the coroner inquiring into the death of the Dowen College Student.\n\nThe pathologist who carried out the autopsy on December 2, 2021, put the cause of death as \u201cacute lung injury due to chemical intoxication.\u201d\n\nThe medical doctor said his initial finding of chemical intoxication as a cause of death was made before a toxicology result ruled out that possibility.\n\nThe pathologist who was summoned by the coroner was testifying as the 12th witness in the proceedings.\n\nREAD ALSO: Petrol Souvenir: Police Arrest, Arraign Prime Suspect\n\nWhile answering questions from the Coroner, Magistrate Mikhail Kadiri, the doctor, who is from the Central Hospital in Warri, Delta State, told the court that his examination of the deceased\u2019s lungs showed that they looked abnormal as the blood vessels were engorged.\n\nHe added that he didn\u2019t see any significant signs of bleeding on the corpse which could have indicated blunt force trauma, contrary to the history provided by the father.\n\n\u201cBefore dissecting the corpse did you notice any trace of beating or trauma on the body?\u201d the coroner asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I only noticed a bruising or scalding of the upper lip. Even when I opened the body, I didn\u2019t see any evidence of significant bleeding or blunt force trauma,\u201d Mr Vhirterhire answered.\n\nThe witness who said he was working with information supplied by the father of the boy said he was also told that the boy was forced to ingest an unknown substance.\n\nTo confirm this, the pathologist said he took out samples of the liver, as well as \u201cdark-coloured particles\u201d found in the stomach and vitreous fluids from the corpse, which he sent to a toxicology lab.\n\nAccording to the witness, the toxicology results later ruled out poisoning, a finding which was reflected in the final autopsy report of December 30, identifying acute pneumonia due to severe sepsis as the cause of death.\n\nWhen asked if death was avoidable and if the deceased could have been treated, the pathologist noted that even with the best of care, death could not be ruled out.\n\n\u201cApart from being a pathologist, I am also a Pastor. I know people who got the best of care but still died. I don\u2019t dispute sentiments from some people that the boy wouldn\u2019t have died if he had been taken to a good hospital for adequate treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked by Anthony Kpokpo, the counsel to Dowen College, what he would have done differently from the family doctor who managed the deceased at home, the witness said, \u201cI would think of urgent blood transfusion and possible intensive care. The last tests done on him on November 30 showed he was clinically ill and required close monitoring,\u201d.\n\nThe coroner has fixed a further hearing for Tuesday, March 15 for further hearing.",

          "text": "Shell Plc and Eni SpA both declared force majeure on key oil flows from Nigeria, threatening to disrupt supplies in a market already fretting about the impact of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nShell\u2019s measure had been in place since March 3, and applies to its Bonny export programme, a Bloomberg report stated on Monday.\n\nEni\u2019s relates to Brass crude cargoes and followed a pipeline blast in the Bayelsa state in the country\u2019s Niger Delta.\n\nForce majeure is a legal step that allows companies not to meet contractual obligations for reasons that are out of their control.\n\nShipments of the two grades had been planned at a rate of 170,000 barrels a day next month but have been in a state of decline over the past few years, according to loading programmes seen by Bloomberg. Flows back in 2020 were planned at about 320,000 barrels a day.\n\nA force majeure doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the entirety of supply would be lost for a given period of time as stored cargoes could still be shipped and repairs would allow shipments to resume.\n\nThe market is closely watching what would happen to Russian oil supply in the wake of the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSome oil companies have stopped buying new cargoes from Moscow and some governments have announced that they are imposing bans on petroleum imports from Russia. Shell has said it will try to go elsewhere for barrels.\n\nThe lost shipments could be significant for Nigeria which was scheduled to export almost 1.5 million barrels a day this month, according to loading plans.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear when Eni\u2019s force majeure began, but the company said that Nigeria LNG was also affected by its measure.\n\nEni declared the force majeure on exports, following a blast at a pipeline blast which is being blame on vandalism.\n\nThe group said it had cut oil exports from its Brass Export terminal by some 25,000 barrels per day, stressing that the pipeline attack was the second after another blast on February 28 at its Obama flow station led to a production shortfall of 5,000 barrels per day.\n\n\u201cForce majeure has been declared at Brass terminal, Bonny NLNG and Okpai Power Plant.\n\n\u201cAll wells connected to that pipeline were immediately shut in whilst river booms and containment barges were mobilised to reduce the impact of the spill,\u201d Eni said in a statement.\n\nThe company deferred gas output of 13 million standard cubic metres per day due to the incident, a Reuters report said.\n\nThe Eni\u2019s oil terminal was shut down in Nigeria after an attack caused a blast on the facility, a development that will see crude production falling at a time when Nigeria is struggling to pump to its OPEC+ quota.\n\nThis was the second such attack on an oil infrastructure facility in Nigeria in three weeks, following a similar incident at Eni\u2019s Obama flow station, Reuters said.\n\n\u201cForce Majeure has been declared at Brass terminal, Bonny NLNG and Okpai Power Plant,\u2019\u2019 according to Eni\u2019s statement.\n\nNigeria, the largest OPEC producer in Africa, has been struggling for months to increase its oil production as much as its quota under the OPEC+ deal allows.\n\nThus, Nigeria has been contributing to the tightening of the oil market together with the other OPEC+ producers who either lack the capacity or investments to raise output.\n\nNigeria is also besieged by frequent oil theft, oil spills, and attacks on infrastructure, which further complicate production and discourage investments from the biggest oil firms in the country.\n\nNigeria\u2019s quota under the OPEC+ agreement was 1.701 million bpd for February, but the country pumped 1.398 million bpd on average last month, according to OPEC\u2019s secondary sources in the Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for the month.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has not been able to reap the full benefit of its oil production following rising in the international price of the commodity due to it\u2019s inability to fully ramp up production to meet its OPEC quota as well as an opaque fuel subsidy system.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Rivers Governor Wike Attacks Edo Governor Obaseki, Calls Him Serial Betrayer",
          "text": "The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Monday, threw caution to the wind and descended heavily on a fellow governor, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, describing him as a serial betrayer, a disposition he further claimed was directly connected to his DNA.\n\nWike, who replied to Obaseki\u2019s response to his initial diatribe against his deputy, however, said a former Edo State governor and sacked national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomole, had been vindicated by Obaseki\u2019s actions.\n\nBut in replying to Wike\u2019s initial attack against the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, Obaseki described the Rivers governor\u2019s attack as \u201cmost unfortunate and totally uncalled for,\u201d warning that Edo State has a history of dealing with bullies.\n\nHowever, Wike, who tendered an apology to Oshiomhole for ignoring his warnings about Obaseki, stated that everything Oshiomhole said about the character of the Edo governor had come to pass.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you ask anybody or check the DNA of Obaseki, you will discover that he is a serial betrayer and an ungrateful person. I apologise to Oshiomhole, who told us about Obaseki. You have been vindicated,\u201d the Rivers governor said.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of Community Secondary School, Omuanwa, in Ikwerre LGA, Wike added: \u201cDr. Abiye Sekibo called me and told me not to reply Obaseki, but I said no. I will reply him, I\u2019m a politician. Obaseki said I\u2019m a bully, but he came to beg a bully for ticket, a bully was his campaign Director General and a bully bullied him into Edo State Government House.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t end there, he still came back with his wife to thank the bully after the election. I slept in Edo State for three days just to deliver Obaseki, but today, I\u2019m a bully. If you check the DNA of Obaseki, what you\u2019ll see is betrayal, serial betrayal and ungratefulness.\n\n\u201cHe said I threatened PDP, assuming without conceding that I threatened PDP, I have every right to do so. I have invested in the party. Rivers State has invested in the party. Rivers State is one of the few states that has voted PDP since 1999. We have invested in the party. You\u2019re a tenant in PDP, I have more stake in PDP than you.\n\n\u201cYou said I\u2019m causing crisis in Edo State, I have capacity, that is why I\u2019m causing crisis. I challenge you to come and cause crisis in Rivers state, then you\u2019ll know who is who. Obaseki, I know your cohorts, I will smoke all of you out. Obaseki, I challenge you to defect back to the APC, we\u2019ll shave your head.\n\n\u201cI know those using you, if I decide to run for president, I will win all of you. Obaseki, melembe melembe. The game has started, I will make you lose weight.\u201d\n\nBut in his response to the initial trigger, Obaseki, in a paid advertorial in some national newspapers, called on the leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to call Wike to order, because the issues raised by his deputy were germane and needed to be resolved in the interest of the party.\n\nHe said the personal attacks by Wike against Shaibu was to say the least, most unfortunate and totally uncalled for.\n\nHis words: \u201cIf Governor Wike was one who is wont to show respect and courtesy to his colleague-governors, he would have ordinarily reached out to me to express his concerns about the views made by my deputy governor, rather than embarking on this unwarranted public onslaught.\n\n\u201cMy deputy governor is a former National President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) and his comment is representative of the essence of the nation\u2019s youth population, who are inclined to openly speak up and question the status quo.\n\n\u201cIf governor Wike cannot understand and adequately respond to the style and character of the Nigerian youth, how can he aspire to lead them?\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Governor Wike should have taken a cue from the manner in which the National Chairman of our party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, responded to my deputy\u2019s remarks, as a conscientious leader, who is able to show empathy and consideration,\u201d the Edo governor stated.\n\nHe pointed out that the concerns expressed by his deputy bordered on pertinent issues affecting the PDP in Edo State, which \u201csince the September 19th 2020 elections, has been able to register over 500,000 members; and till date, these new members have not been properly integrated into our party after two years. Also, the leaders, executives and members who came with me into the party have still not been accepted, integrated or harmonised into the party.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the fact that old members of Edo PDP, who are open to inclusion and supportive of building a large party are being vilified and ostracised by a cabal purportedly led by Chief Dan Orbih, who is your perpetual guest in Port Harcourt and is remotely used to orchestrate the destabilisation of the party in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to recall at this point that a political solution gave rise to the emergence of Chief Dan Orbih first as Acting and then as Substantive National Vice Chairman, South South, of our party, when Chief Emma Odidi resigned that position to allow Chief Orbih to ascend. It is, therefore, curious why this type of political solution is no longer tenable to resolve the political impasse in Edo State PDP.\n\n\u201cWe can categorically state that in the comments of the deputy governor, he at no point threatened the party as Governor Wike has alleged. Rather, it is Governor Wike, who has at different times, threatened the PDP.\n\n\u201cSome of these instances include: On September 16, 2018, Governor Wike threatened the party that there would be grave consequences if it moved the National Convention from Port Harcourt in the run up to the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cOn September 12, 2019, Governor Wike also threatened to cause trouble for the party over the emergence of Hon. Ndudi Elumelu as the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that Wike had contributed to the advancement of the party, just like others, since 1999, he posited that, \u201cNo one is against his desire to run for president, however, his ambition should not be embarked on in such a way that it would cause disruption at different levels, such as the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum as well as different chapters of the party across the country.\n\n\u201cIt clearly amounts to delusion of grandeur, for any one man to nurse the idea that he owns or has more stake in the PDP and everyone should pander to him. We are all equal stakeholders in the party and an aggregate of the ideas, opinions and contributions of all leaders and members should form the position of the party and not the view of one individual or a select few.\n\n\u201cWhile Governor Wike is free to use his resources as he deems fit in pursuit of his ambition, he should not attempt to cow, intimidate, cajole and threaten others into doing his bidding. Edo State cannot and will not be procured for anyone\u2019s personal ambition.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigeria needs now are strong democratic institutions and not strong men; that is why we will join the great leaders of our party across the country to build PDP into a strong, large and indomitable party that will win next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike and his collaborators headed by Chief Dan Orbih in Edo State will not succeed in destabilising the PDP in Edo State as they did other states like Cross River just to secure delegates to actualize his alleged personal ambition to run for presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we don\u2019t accept political bullies and overlords and historically, we have demonstrated our capacity to unshackle ourselves and dethrone bullies and highhanded leaders.\n\n\u201cI appeal to all well-meaning leaders of our great party to call Governor Wike to order to desist from his current unguarded and disruptive tendencies. From all indications, today, PDP is set to take over the leadership of Nigeria provided we can rein in the self-interest of a few leaders to put the task of rescuing Nigeria above their personal ambitions.\u201d\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City",

          "title": "Nigeria: Micro-Zoning Tearing APC Apart Amid Leadership Crisis",
          "text": "The crisis in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the zoning of national offices, ahead of the party\u2019s national convention scheduled for March 26, has shifted to the zones. State governors are clashing with other party leaders over who gets what in the proposed arrangement.\n\nMultiple sources told THISDAY on Monday that the leadership of APC was sharply divided over the micro-zoning of the party offices.\n\nAn insider said many of the APC governors in the North-central, for instance, want the position of National Chairman thrown open, against the purported endorsement of Senator Abdullahi Adamu by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOne of chairmanship aspirants told THISDAY, \u201cSince the party has allocated the position to the North-central, the zone should be allowed to decide who becomes its choice, rather than by imposition, as being speculated in the media.\u201d\n\nOther aspirants in the race for National Chairman in the zone include Senator Tanko Al-Makura and Saliu Mustapha.\n\nIn the South-west, where the post of National Secretary had been zoned, national leader of APC and former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, was said to be at odds with the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, as well as Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun over the choice of Senator Iyiola Omisore from Osun State for the position.\n\nAPC governors in the zone were said to have settled for Omisore for National Secretary, \u201cfor political strategy,\u201d but Tinubu and former National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, were said to be opposed to the choice.\n\nSimilarly, in the South-south, the micro-zoning of National Publicity Secretary to Delta State, which was believed to have been influenced by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege, THISDAY learnt, was generating conflict among party leaders in the zone.\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC officially approved the recommendations of its committee on zoning arrangement recently. In the zoning agreement, the posts of National Chairman and Deputies of National Secretary, National Legal Adviser, National Publicity Secretary, and others were allocated to the North-central.\n\nThe positions of National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, and Deputy National Welfare Secretary were zoned to South-south.\n\nThe positions of National Secretary, National Youth Leader, and Deputy National Auditor were expected to be shared by members in South-west states, comprising Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, and Oyo.\n\nThe South-east got the positions of Deputy National Chairman (South), National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, and Deputy National Organising Secretary, among others.\n\nNorth-east was to produce Deputy National Chairman (North), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (North-east), Deputy National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Women Leader.\n\nThe North-west zone would produce the National Vice Chairman (North-west), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, and Deputy National Youth Leader.\n\nMeanwhile, there appeared to be no deal yet between the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the ruling party over the latter\u2019s planned March 17 emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting. The electoral umpire insisted it was not aware of any leadership change in APC.\n\nINEC insisted it would not monitor the NEC meeting because the letter inviting it to observe the exercise, as required by law, was not signed by persons vested with such power by the CECPC headed by Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, and Senator John Akpanudoedehe, as Chairman and Secretary, respectively. The commission\u2019s position on the planned NEC meeting was made clear on Monday by INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr. Festus Okoye, while speaking on a national television.\n\nOkoye said INEC would follow the Electoral Act in dealing with the political parties. He stressed that the commission was only advising APC to follow the rules of the game.\n\nThe INEC commissioner stated, \u201cINEC is only telling the APC that it recognises only letters signed by the CECPC Chairman and Secretary of APC and not letters signed by other party chieftains who are not recognised by the commission.\n\n\u201cAside this, the Electoral Act states that INEC must be given a 21 days\u2019 notice of any planned meeting of political parties for it to get ready to monitor such meetings of political parties.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye explained that APC could go ahead and hold the NEC meeting, pointing out, though, that if the meeting would lead to a change of leadership, the commission would not accept or recognise such outcome.\n\nHe explained, \u201cThe APC has been reminded of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 Notice of any Convention, Congress, Conference, or Meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its Executive Committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective offices.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, Section 77 of the Electoral Act 2022 says political parties must provide the authentic Register of Members during Convention, Congress, Conference, or Meetings which INEC will monitor. These are the crux of the matter.\u201d\n\nINEC had on Friday stated, in response to a letter by APC inviting the commission to an emergency NEC meeting of the party convened by Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello, on behalf of the CECPC, that it did not recognise Bello as the APC chairman.\n\nThe commission\u2019s position attracted criticism from some APC chieftains, who openly dared INEC to stand in the way of the NEC meeting on Thursday and the proposed national convention on March 26.\n\nSpokesman of CECPC, Ismaila Ahmed, who is also APC Youth Leader, was very critical of INEC\u2019s stand on being served a \u201cthe 21 days\u2019 notice of any meeting by political parties\u201d, as recommended by the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nTHISDAY reported on Monday that leaders of the ruling party might have agreed to keep Buni as Interim Chairman of CECPC, while Bello functioned as de facto chairman, though in acting capacity. Buni had travelled for medical reasons and transmitted power to Bello in writing to act as CECPC chairman. It was gathered that the party maintained that the letter of transition remained in force, even though Buni remained interim caretaker chairman.\n\nIt was also reported that the fate of the CECPC secretary was uncertain in all the permutations and intrigues playing out. A faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate he was keen on holding the meeting. Apparently miffed by what he was told, the president was said to have directed that Buni be removed and replaced. Buni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself.\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigerian Airlines Warn Only Three Days to Shut Down Operations Over Aviation Fuel Scarcity",
          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAirline Operators in Nigeria on Monday warned that they have only three days left to shut down operations over lingering scarcity of aviation fuel.\n\nIn their presentation, Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) threatened that they had only three days to shut down operations over lack of aviation fuel.\n\nRepresented by the Chief Executive Officer of Airpeace, Mr. Allen Onyema, they expressed concern over the high cost of aviation fuel.\n\nThis was as the stakeholders in the aviation sector agreed to peg the price of the aviation fuel at N500 per litre.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari announced the decision at the meeting of the stakeholders with the special committee of the House of Representatives investigating the circumstances surrounding the recent hike in the price of aviation fuel chaired by the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase.\n\nThe resolution to peg the price at N500 per litre would be experimented for only three days from today and within the period the Association of Airline Operators and the major oil marketers are to engage themselves and work out modalities that would lead to the permanent reduction of the price of aviation fuel in the country.\n\nKyari, however disclosed that at the moment there were 19 oil companies with 88 million litres of aviation fuel in the country.\n\nThe NNPC boss explained: \u201cWe know this is a very difficult situation. We know that once aviation fuel increases, prices of flight ticket will certainly increase and this can surely cost pain for Nigerians. That is why we are working with you to ensure that those pains are minimised to the barest minimum and one of the elements is the pricing of aviation fuel.\n\n\u201cSo, what we have engaged with MOMAN, DAPMAN and the airline operators is that in three days\u2019 time, their representatives will sit down and agree on a transparent base for pricing.\n\n\u201cThat means that they ought to have a referenced benchmark that is quoted transparently in the market. They will have a referenced exchange rate for the naira so that anyone can compete.\n\n\u201cThey will also agree on a premium which currently differs from customer-to-customer, depending on the volume you buy and the credit level.\u201d\n\nKyari added: \u201cThese are the things they can negotiate in three days and close, so that going forward, there is a transparent decision on pricing. This will no doubt throw up the actual value of the product in the market.\n\n\u201cYou will no longer see these discrepancies we have seen where some people are selling at N445 and some are selling at N630. This will completely bring close such that you will not see these differences.\n\n\u201cWe also agreed that in the interim, between now and three days they have to close negotiations, the lowest price we have seen this morning was N445 and the highest was N605.\n\n\u201cThere is a trader that is selling at N630 and we don\u2019t think this is normal and so, we discounted it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the NNPC GMD said it was, \u201cagreed that we sell at N500 in the next three days and after that, they will switch to the new price that everyone can assess.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, as requested by the Airline Operators Association of Nigeria, \u201cthey would be granted license by the authority to import petroleum products, particularly ATK so that they can have a way of benchmarking the sales of other customers and can also bring in cheaper products whenever it is possible.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the operators through Onyema requested for licencing of its members for the importation of Aviation Fuel to end the perennial hike in the price and scarcity of ATK.\n\nThey maintained that they have the competence to import the required ATK for their operations without any hitches.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWe can afford to import this fuel, let NNPC give us the licence and we will no longer complain. I have the mandate of every airline in this country to announce to you that if they can\u2019t come down from their rooftops, we have only three more days to be able to fly. \u201cWe are not threatening this country. We have been subsiding what we have been doing. The rate as at today is N630, N640 and N605. We have an aircraft going to Kano, it has about 7000 liters of fuel in it, multiple it, sir by N630. The unit cost per seat is about N70000 per seat. You have not talked about insurance that is very static. Nigerians pay heavy insurance premium because this country is stigmatised.\n\n\u201cYou have to insure abroad. It is a must because all the insurance companies in Nigeria put together cannot even pay for one aircraft. So, you have to go abroad to insure. \u201cYet the fuel cost which is supposed to be about 30 to 40 per cent in every clime, in Nigeria it about 70 per cent even before time. So, you can now see the mortality rate of airlines in this country.\n\n\u201cFrom what is happening, if it continues this way, the least ticket will be about N120 for economy and we don\u2019t want to do that. We want to inform the house that we are demanding that we should be given licence to import this fuel. If we can buy jets that cost hundreds of billions of dollars, we can afford to import this fuel.\u201d\n\nResponding to the resolutions read by the NNPC GMD, Onyeama said the implication of the N500 per litre benchmark for three days was that the ticket for airfare would be N85,000 per seat on economy.\n\nThey however expressed gratitude to the House of Representatives and the NNPC for standing by the operators.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee and Deputy Speaker, Wase faulted the presentation made by the Chief Executive, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, Ahmed Farouk, who was represented by an Executive Director, Ogbogu Ukoha who insisted that prices had been discounted.\n\nWase had asked the regulatory body the current price of the product and why it was so exorbitant but was referred to the marketers who however sidestepped the questions and could not give specific answers.\n\nHe thereafter warned NMDPRA against blackmailing the government.\n\nEditor",
