          "text": ",\n\nThe Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD), said that workers of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) are not entitled to the pension increase of 33 per cent.\n\nMr Gbenga Ajayi, PTAD\u2019s Head of Corporate Communications, said in a statement on Thursday in Abuja that the PHCN pensioners were already on a special salary structure before the pension review for pensioners was approved.\n\nAjayi said that the clarification was necessary as the attention of PTAD Management had been drawn to a growing agitation by some group of PHCN Pensioners, known as concerned PHCN Pensioners.\n\nHe said that the group is alleging that PTAD had colluded with some \u201cpowerful individuals\u201d to deprive them of the 33 per cent pension increment as approved by the Federal Government in 2010.\n\n\u201cWe would like to state unequivocally, that the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, the Federal Government agency responsible for policy statement on emoluments including pensions had directed via a letter of approval Ref: SWC/S/04/S.542/26 of September 26, 2014, that the retired staff of the defunct PHCN are not entitled to the pension increase of 33 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis is because PHCN pensioners were already on a special salary structure before the pension review for Pensioners who, while in service, were on one of the Harmonized Salary Structures of the Federal Public Service.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that PHCN Pensioners took the Federal Government to the National Industrial Court (NIC) Abuja on this issue.\n\n\u201cAfter several engagements, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the implementation of 9.7 per cent increase in the pensions of Ex-PHCN Retirees under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS).\n\n\u201cThis approval was used as an out-of-court settlement in order to put an end to the suit at the NIC, Abuja,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nHe said that following the approval of the President, via approval letter Ref. SWC/S/04/S.557/III/546) of May 7, 2021, the 9.7 per cent increment was implemented with effect from June 1, 2016, and the arrears paid in December 2021 to all eligible Ex-PHCN Retirees.\n\nAyayi said that it was therefore preposterous and uncalled for that the group wanted to conveniently forget the amicable agreement reached by all parties and arm-twist the Federal Government to make claims on the 33 per cent pension increment.\n\nHe said that other related issues concerning the group of pensioners have since been communicated to the Coordinator of the Concerned PHCN Pensioners, Mr Dunmoye Oladimeji, via a letter dated March 17, 2021, with Ref: (PTAD/PaPD/231/VolII/263).\n\n\u201cPTAD will continue to give priority to the welfare of Defined Benefit Scheme Pensioners,\u201d Ajayi said, adding that President Buhari remains committed to the welfare of pensioners and has consistently demonstrated that by approving the payment of outstanding pension arrears and regular payment of monthly pensions.",

I am short of words. I have served in Lagos, I tell you, nobody or group did what you have done. I am surprised and this will take me a few weeks to overcome. From the point of filling this form to the point of submission, it will be at the back of my mind that my people purchased this expression of interest and nomination forms for me. I sincerely appreciate you and promise that I will not take your support for granted\u201d, the senator stated.\n\nHe maintained that it was tough for him to make the final decision to return home, saying the gesture would forever be cherished, while reiterating his support for the administration of the incumbent administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun, submitted that he would mobilise resources and people to ensure the governor is elected for another four years.\n\nThe presentation ceremony was attended by leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the district which comprises the State Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Mr. Olaolu Olabimtan; the former Chairman of SUBEB, Alhaji Muftau Ajibola; the erstwhile Chairman of OORBDA, Chief (Mrs) Iyabo Apampa and Chairman of Ogun State House of Assembly Service Commission, Hon.

          "text": "The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU), on Thursday, resumed negotiations with a view to finding an amicable solution to the lingering industrial action.\n\nSpeaking at the resumption of talks between the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the Unions and the Federal Government, the General Secretary of NASU, Comrade Peter Adeyemi, said the meeting initiated by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige appears to be yielding some desired results.\n\nAdeyemi, however, bemoaned the circumstances that led to declaration of the strike, saying they were equally pained that this action has been prolonged by the government.\n\nHe said nobody should blame the unions for their action, adding that they were ready to go back to work as soon as the promises made to them in the last few years were fulfilled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to stay at home for one minute any longer, but that will be dependent on how the government fulfills its own part of the agreement.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here with an open mind. We don\u2019t want to continue to disrupt the system. If the government refuses to fulfill its own part. We shouldn\u2019t be blamed.\u201d\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Andrew Adejo, who represented his principal, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, tendered an apology to the unions on behalf of his minister.\n\nHe said the impression that the Education Ministry abandoned their workers to their fate was not true but contrived to make it that way.\n\nHe urged the unions to forgive in the spirit of the just concluded Lenten season and Ramadam, so that they would have a fruitful discussion, saying with the social apartheid arising from the spate of strikes and problems therefrom, the earlier the issues were resolved the better for everybody, especially the children and their education.\n\nResponding to the apology, Adeyemi said, \u201cpart of the efforts you have made consistently has started yielding results. We are now seeing the permanent secretary of education here.\n\n\u201cWe can recall very vividly that your Excellency has done so much to get our employers to attend meetings, which have started achieving the desired result. Today, I am particularly happy that the new permanent secretary has come to apologise.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think the apology is not the problem for us. Our problem is that the Ministry should do what is exactly expected of them. They should assist the Ministry of Labour that is saddled with the responsibility of restoring order in our system. And if they do their own part, I am very convinced that the problem will be resolved.\u201d\n\nMaking remarks, Ngige expressed hope that the meeting would be truthful, fruitful and cordial, so that all those on strike would go back to work.\n\nRecall that while members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities ASUU have been on strike for over two months, other sister unions such as NASU, SSANU, NAAT have also been on strike to press home demands ranging from grievances associated with the implementation of the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System, IPPIS.",

          "text": "Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, has said that the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, AfCFTA is going to be the largest free trade area in the world and make doing business much easier for countries with seamless access to 54 markets which is a huge advantage.\n\nThe minister, who attended the 7th Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi India, where he took part in two panel discussions with the themes \u201cOut of Africa: Leading on Trade and Economic Integration\u201d, and \u201cBuilding the Gates of Globalisation: Investment; Infrastructure and Taboos\u201d, called for stronger ties between Nigeria and India.\n\nHe also took time out to speak on the various partnerships for infrastructure development, such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and other initiatives with India, the European Union, and other African countries all of which contribute enormously towards development.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhy I say AfCTA is going to be a game changer is because it will make it easier for our political leaders and Africans\n\nto reach out to other African countries so what will come as a result or consequences will be infrastructure- the trans saharan highway and continental highway across Africa promoting connectivity and doing business. That will be the natural result of pulling down all the barriers that are preventing this connectivity within the continent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the role of Africa in the upcoming world in terms of trade, cooperation and partnerships especially with Africa\u2019s Asian partners and India as a special partner, Onyeama said bearing in mind the fact that Africa has always been pioneering in connecting the world since ancient times with the trade routes going through Africa along the spice trade routes or the Suez canal, with the new digital age, Africa is playing a role with it\u2019s youth full of potential and looking for partnerships with a dynamic and prosperous Asia.\n\nOnyeama, who in this context and from the Nigerian perspective\u2026a perspective of a country already sharing close ties with India, he shared his thoughts on how India and Africa can work together to foster further connectivity and commerce.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria and India have had a long history of very close cooperation and people to people relations with generations of Indian families living in Nigeria, Nigerian students in India and in the military establishments.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe know ourselves very well and of course now in a globalised world there is a lot more we can do. India has a comparative advantage in the health sector- we saw the role India played in the COVID-19 outbreak. India has a very strong pharmaceutical sector so the health field is an area we can do a lot with India. And we have seen the ICT miracle that is in Bangalore. Also, the technology capacity of India is another area that we can cooperate in. Nigeria has a very youthful population that is also getting into ICT and is extremely dynamic and the partnership with India could absolutely be a game changer for us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Onyeama said \u201cIndia is the second-largest producer of steel in the world. We want to industrialise. We have had challenges with developing our steel industry in Nigeria so that\u2019s another area we can do alot with India. We have a framework already although it\u2019s a continental framework of India-Africa Summit and clearly we are looking at developing a more precise roadmap that responds to the priorities and needs of our country.\n\n\u201cWe can also look at other areas such as the culture industries. You have Bollywood and we have Nollywood so there is a great deal we can do together.\u201d\n\nHe also explained that though the two countries have very similar demography in many ways, \u201cthe population of India is way bigger, but in Africa Nigeria is the largest country and so I think that the ingredients for substantive partnerships is very much there.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Post COVID-19 and in the context of Africas entry into the global value chain, Onyeama said/ \u201cWe want to diversify not just our production but also our partners. Where value chains are concerned its always been targeted towards the western countries but clearly Asia is a lot more prominent in our engagement and notwithstanding the global challenges of today we are moving more and more increasing our partnership with Asia and of course India is a big part of that as is China and one or two other countries. So notwithstanding whatever else is happening globally we intend to prioritise and push on.\u201d\n\nOn the sidelines of the seventh Raisina Dialogue which had more than 200 speakers from 90 countries in attendance, Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama met separately with his host External Affairs Minister of India, Dr. S Jaishankar, and colleagues from Slovenia and Philippines to discuss bilateral relations between Nigeria and the different countries.\n\nWhile in India, Onyeama visited one of India\u2019s largest steel and power plants, addressed and inaugurated the Nigeria-India Business Council with an impressive attendance by Indian captains of Industry and interacted with 30 invited African Ambassadors and members of the Nigerian Community including students.",

          "text": "\u2022As project set to create 169,972 Jobs\n\nKasim Sumaina and Gilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said the Lekki Deep Sea Port when completed would make Nigeria regain the maritime business that it lost to ports in Togo, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana.\n\nAccording to the Minister, it would also be a big boost for Nigeria in its quest to take advantage of the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\nThe minister who said this during a tour of the Lekki Deep Sea Port, also estimated that over $201 billion in taxes, royalties and duties would be generated for the Nigerian government when the port commences operations in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nHe said the aggregate impact of the Lekki Deep Sea Port put at $361 billion in 45 years would be over 200 times the cost of building the port.\n\nAccording to him, the deep sea port would be a game changer because of the impact it would have on the nation\u2019s economy when completed.\n\n\u201cThe investment is huge \u2013 $1.53 billion on fixed assets and $800 million dollars on construction. In addition, it will create 169,972 jobs and bring revenues totalling $201 billion to state and federal governments through taxes, royalties and duties.\n\n\u201cThe direct and induced business revenue impact is estimated at $158 billion in addition to a qualitative impact on manufacturing, trade and commercial services sector,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, the minister said: \u201cThe Lekki Deep Sea Port, a build, own, operate and transfer concern, is a massive project, a game changer and a pace setter. It is the deepest sea port in Nigeria and West Africa, and that in itself is a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cA major advantage we have to leverage is transshipment. With this port, Nigeria will become a transshipment hub and the revenue we are currently losing to our neighboring countries will come here and that is big,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs you know, this project is being done in phases. Phase one has reached 89 per cent and will be completed in September this year. The facilities here are first class. We have seven ships to shore cranes and 21 RTG cranes.\n\n\u201cNo port in Nigeria currently has this. The excellent equipment is why this port can do 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (teu), which is more than four times the number that can currently be handled by our other ports,\u201d he averred.\n\nResponding, the Managing Director, Lekki Deep Sea Port, Du Ruogang, said the port would change the economic landscape of Nigeria and West Africa at large.\n\nHe said the Lekki port would soon become a central hub for the West African region.\n\nAlso, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers Council, (NSC), Emmanuel Jime, described the port as a game changer for the Nigerian economy, but stressed the need for critical infrastructure to be developed to ease evacuation of cargoes out of the port.\n\n\u201cWe need to map out modalities on how we can evacuate cargoes out of the port so that we do not have a replica of Apapa and Tin Can ports,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis visit is the second we are making to this area within a month, coming after our trip to the Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals as well as the Dangote Fertilizer on April 3rd 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Funds may put party in vantage position against opposition\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nA conservative estimate by THISDAY has shown that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may rake in over N30 billion from the sale of nomination and expression of interest forms, giving the ruling party enormous firepower to face the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWith a huge war chest expected from sale of forms, the ruling party will have a commanding advantage in the field if the resources are properly deployed,\u201d a political analyst, who preferred anonymity, told THISDAY last night.\n\nThe presidential nomination form in APC goes for N100 million; the governorship form is sold for N50 million; Senate, N20 million; House of Representatives, N10 million; and House of Assembly, N2 million.\n\nA rundown on the expected revenue from the electoral process shows APC may generate over N2.3 billion from the sale of presidential forms; N2.8 billion from the sale of governorship forms; and roughly N6.54 billion from the sale of senatorial forms. The party could make about N10.8 billion from the sale of forms to a minimum of three House of Representatives aspirants from each of the country\u2019s 360 federal constituencies. And it could generate about N7.93 billion from the sale of forms to a minimum of four aspirants vying for each of the 991 House of Assembly seats across the country.\n\nTHISDAY arrived at these estimates looking at the number of likely contestants in the various categories of elective offices.\n\nSo far, 23 presidential aspirants have indicated interest in the presidency under the ruling party and APC is expected to generate N2.3 billion from the sale of presidential forms. As more contenders join the race or drop out of the race, the figures would either go up or come down.\n\nWith governorship elections holding in 28 states next year, THISDAY estimated that there would be at least two aspirants from each of the states, and at N50 million per aspirant, the party stood to rake in N2.8 billion.\n\nFor the Senate, there are 109 senatorial seats in the country, and with at least three aspirants from each senatorial district, and forms going for N20 million, the party may rake in N6.54 billion. The 360 House of Representatives seats, with an estimated three aspirants per federal constituency, and the form going for N10 million, give the party about N10.8 billion.\n\nIn addition, with an estimated four people picking nomination forms to contest in the primary election for each of the 991 House of Assembly seats, at N2 million per form, APC is likely to rake in N7.93 billion.\n\nThose that have either indicated interest in contesting the APC presidential primaries or picked their forms include the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Governor Muhammed Abubakar of Jigawa State, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, and former Senate President Ken Nnamani.\n\nOthers are former National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiohmole; former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Minister of Transportation, Rt.

          "text": "\u2022Wants attackers of Global Body\u2019s Building in 2011 Prosecuted\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n\n\nUnited Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the intergovernmental organisation remains steadfast in its commitment to a peaceful Nigeria. Guterres stated this yesterday in Abuja during a two-day visit to the country.\n\nGuterres called for the prosecution of those that attacked the UN House in Abuja on August 26, 2011, stressing that perpetrators of terrorism in Nigeria must be held to account. He said the international body dedicated to maintaining global peace and security was adopting a victim-centred approach to the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nGuterres, who also paid a working visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, disclosed that the UN had concluded plans to offer Nigeria an additional $351 million as part of its $1.1 billion humanitarian response scheme for the country.\n\nBuhari, in his remarks, expressed Nigeria\u2019s gratitude to the UN and world leaders who were supporting the country in its fight against terrorism. He said the recent spotlight on Russia and Ukraine could easily distract attention from other pertinent global challenges.\n\nThe UN chief, who was on the last day of his two-day visit, laid a wreath in honour of victims of the August 26, 2011 terrorist attack on the UN House. The attack claimed the lives of 23 persons, including many UN staff and civilians.\n\n\u201cOn that tragic day (August 26, 2011), an appalling terrorist attack on the UN House left 23 UN employees and civilians\u2019 dead and 16 injured,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cThose staff members, who lost their lives, are heroes, who proudly served Nigerians through the UN organisations,\u201d he added.\n\nThe secretary-general stated, \u201cWe encourage all Nigerians, who have endured similar violence in their own communities. In our victim-centred approach, perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nGuterres thanked the Nigerian government for repairing the UN House, which had enabled the staff to return.\n\nSpeaking after meeting with the UN chief, Catholic Archbishop Emeritus of Abuja, Cardinal John Onaiyekan, told reporters that his interaction with Guterres was on how to resolve the dilemma of a country full of talented people, but facing a lot of challenges.\n\nOnaiyekan said, \u201cNigerians are genuinely religious, but we see around us so much corruption and outright wickedness.\u201d He stated that it had become pertinent to interrogate how a nation could be so rich, but full of poor people; and how a nation could be full of talented people and yet hardly organised.\n\nThe priest laid the problem at the door of the government.\n\nOnaiyekan said he told the UN secretary-general that Nigerians \u201care not satisfied with how far the rulers are dealing with the issues concerning us, the issue of poverty, the issue of insecurity, and the issues of social services. The government tells us they are doing their best and we say that their best is not good enough. We believe we can do better.\u201d\n\nOn the lingering herders-farmers\u2019 crisis, the Cardinal regretted the failure of the federal government to address the issue of armed herdsmen in the last 10 years, saying this is perpetuating the displacement of farmers.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt seems the displacement is becoming permanent and the herders are taking over the farmlands and the government still claims they have no way of bringing things back to normalcy. The result is that farmers can no longer farm and we are facing the prospects of famine, because the parts of Nigeria that used to produce a lot of food, many of them can no longer farm.\u201d\n\nA Professor of Law at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo, who also met the UN chief with her group, said, \u201cWe discussed the problems and the status of women in Nigeria and how he can help us to hold our elected officials to account, especially, when it comes to gender parity and women participation in politics.\u201d\n\nDuring his meeting with Buhari, Guterres said following his visit to Borno State on Tuesday, \u201cI came out of Borno with the sense that Nigeria is able to defeat this threat.\n\n\u201cWe are very active in support of the humanitarian efforts of the Nigerian government and that is why we have called for an additional $351 million as part of the overall $1.1 billion for humanitarian response plan for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut despite all they have seen and endured, the people I met remain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives.\n\n\u201cTo that end, I welcome the establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Return and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North-east.\n\n\u201cThis spirit of hope amidst hardship \u2013 and solidarity in struggle \u2013 was also at the centre of my discussions with the presidency today.\u201d\n\nThe secretary-general said discussions with Buhari also touched on laying the groundwork for peaceful and democratic elections in the country next year, and the full participation of Nigerian women and young people.\n\nWhile speaking with newsmen, Guterres stated that measures to address security challenges in the country, Lake Chad, and the Sahel, including the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel, were discussed during his meeting with Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe also discussed the government\u2019s measures to address security challenges across the country. I want to extend my deepest condolences to the victims of the appalling attacks in Plateau State two and a half weeks ago. It\u2019s a tragic reminder of terrorism scourge across West Africa and the Sahel.\n\n\u201cAnother reason why the United Nations is committed to supporting national and regional efforts to combat terrorism, violent extremism, organised crimes and the root causes, such as poverty, exclusion and food insecurity. This includes the UN\u2019s integrated strategy for the Sahel.\u201d\n\nGuterres thanked Buhari for supporting the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission, and promised more commitment from the UN on COVID-19 vaccination, vulnerability of countries to global warming, global food crisis response, and reform of the UN Security Council.\n\n\u201cI thanked President Buhari for his unwavering support of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission. And we also discussed the other challenges that, of course, Nigeria is facing today. Nigeria was, like all African countries, victim of the unequal recovery from COVID-19,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UN secretary-general said the war in Ukraine would make things worse with regard to global food, energy and financial systems.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur analysis indicates that the war in Ukraine is only making things worse, setting in motion a three-dimensional crisis that is devastating global food, energy and financial systems for the developing countries.\n\n\u201cThat is why in the earliest days of this war, I established the Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, involving all UN agencies and international financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThe steering committee is chaired by the Deputy Secretary-General that you know very well, Amina Mohammed, and the group has developed concrete recommendations in three areas.\n\n\u201cOne, we need to ensure a steady flow of food and energy through open markets by lifting all unnecessary export restrictions, directing surpluses and reserves to those in need, and keeping a lid on food prices to calm our market volatility.\n\n\u201cBut let me be clear, there is really no true solution to the problem of global food security without bringing back the agricultural production of Ukraine and the food and fertiliser production of Russia and Belarus into world markets, despite the war. I\u2019m determined to do everything to facilitate a dialogue that can help achieve this objective.\n\n\u201cTwo, on energy, countries must resist hoarding, and release strategic stockpiles and additional reserves to countries in need, while accelerating the deployment of renewable energy.\n\n\u201cAnd, three, international financial institutions need to urgently increase liquidity and fiscal space and improve existing debt relief mechanisms, so governments can now not only avoid default, but they can invest in their people, especially in universal social protection at this moment of rising prices.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations presented concrete proposals during the spring meetings of the World Bank and the IMF, ranging from the mobilisation of the various funds and instruments that already exist \u2013 but are not sufficiently implemented \u2013 to a much stronger use and redistribution of special drawing rights, as well as effective debt relief measures.\u201d\n\nGuterres, who was in Borno State on Tuesday, said what he saw was a departure from the picture of hopelessness and despair that had been painted, adding, \u201cPeople exuded hope.\u201d\n\nHe stated, \u201cYesterday (Tuesday), I visited Maiduguri, where the United Nations is supporting the internally displaced. I was deeply moved by their stories and struggles.\n\n\u201cThese include the struggles with hunger, with the World Food Programme projecting 4.1 million people in the North-east of Nigeria to be food insecure in the upcoming lean season.\n\n\u201cYesterday, I had the opportunity to visit Borno State and I must confess I arrived in Borno with the impression caused by so many years in which I was hearing stories about how dramatic the situation was, so terrible. The suffering of the people, how impossible to control the terrorist activities, a sense of despair.\n\n\u201cBut the Borno I met yesterday was the Borno of hope and I saw an enlightened policy, aiming not only at defeating militarily the terrorists, but at addressing the root causes of terrorism.\n\n\u201cI saw the governor committed to re-establish the confidence between the people in the government, committed to provide the people in their different villages around the state the capacity to protect themselves.\n\n\u201cCommitted to create conditions for the return of the displaced, but also for the reintegration of those that have abandoned Boko Haram, that have finally discovered that terrorism is a crime against humanity and the crime against God\u2019s will and that now need support to reintegrate into society, and that support I could witness in the visit I made.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why yesterday I appealed strongly to the international community to fully support what is being done in Borno State, to make sure that the hope that I saw can be transformed into a reality of peace and prosperity for everybody.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe Nigeria and its people have a big role to play in shaping solutions to the global crisis engulfing our world.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Buhari noted that the country and the African continent were already concerned that the attention on Russia and Ukraine could crowd out other global issues. He added that the visit of the UN chief clearly showed that \u201cthe world has not forgotten us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Buhari, terrorism remains a threat to global peace, security and progress, with many killed, and millions displaced by the insurgents.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhen we assumed office, the North-east was the major security problem we inherited in 2015, but we have been able to make people understand that you cannot kill people and shout \u2018Allahu Akbar,\u2019 (God is great!).\n\n\u201cIt is either you don\u2019t know what you are saying or you are simply stupid. God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. Luckily, the people understood our message and it has made great impact.\u201d\n\nBuhari told his visitor that the government had started a gradual, but steady, process of resettlement and reintegration, where citizens were encouraged to return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.\n\nThe president thanked the secretary general for the maiden visit to Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A group of impostors supported by the Muhammadu Buhari regime are presently plotting to use the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other available means to stop the presidential bid of human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt on Thursday that the impostors are led by one Leonard Ezenwa, who has foisted himself on the African Action Congress (AAC) party as the chairman \u2013 the party on whose platform Sowore is seeking to contest for president in the 2023 general elections.\n\nOmoyele Sowore\n\n\u201cEzenwa and his group were recently mobilised by the Muhammadu Buhari regime to do everything possible to stop Sowore from contesting in the 2023 elections. Mr. Ezenwa is also a stooge used by INEC chairman Mahmood Yakubu to boost the image of INEC and bribe political parties to look away from INEC infractions,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\n\u201cEzenwa was recently removed as the Chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC). He collected N150 million from (Governor Nyesom) Wike to help him defeat the AAC candidate, Biokpomabo Awara, in the 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cHe was known for selling party tickets to either APC (All Progressives Congress) or PDP (Peoples Democratic Party) cronies. He also collected N10 million from Governor Yahaya Bello to endorse him in 2019,\u201d the source continued.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Ezenwa had again been freshly mobilised to launch attacks against Sowore\u2019s presidential bid through his cronies in the AAC and elsewhere.\n\nSaharaReporters had on April 26 reported that an Appeal Court sitting in Abuja reserved judgment to a later date in an appeal filed by Sowore, challenging a high court judgment on the leadership of the AAC.\n\nSowore had in an appeal marked CA/A/812/2019 challenged the judgment of Justice Inyang Ekwo declaring Leonard Nzenwa as Acting Chairman of the AAC.\n\nSee Also Politics Sowore Remains Our Leader, Leonard Nzenwa Is An Impostor -African Action Congress\n\nAt the resumed hearing of the appeal, before a three-man panel headed by Justice A. J. Adah, Sowore's lawyer, who is also the National Legal Adviser of the party, Barr. Inibehe Effiong, urged the court to set aside the judgment of the lower court and grant all the reliefs sought by the appellant.\n\nHe prayed the court to be lenient in fixing a shorter date for the judgement considering the timetable by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) regarding the party primaries.\n\nEffiong, who later addressed journalists on the court premises, said, \"Our appeal is predicated on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, breach of Sowore and Dr. Malcom to a fair hearing and lastly on improper evaluation of evidence.\n\n\"The matter has been delayed since 2019 for several reasons but thanks to the Glory of God today, we have finally come to the last bus stop in this matter. Because today I am to announce that our appeal was heard and judgement has now been reserved for a date that will be communicated.\n\nSee Also Politics Large Crowd Welcomes AAC Presidential Aspirant, Sowore As He Campaigns Inside Ondo Lake\n\n\"You are also aware that after the hearing of the appeal, I did call the attention of my Lords to the INEC timetable regarding the time for primaries in pleading with the court that in fixing a date for judgement, that date should be taken into cognisance and my Lords said they are aware of it.\n\n\"The obstacles to the hearing of the appeal on the merit were defeated today. INEC which is supposed to be an unbiased umpire filed a brief of argument and when you open the next page, you see preliminary objection and they did not respond to any of our arguments.\n\n\"INEC agreed with us that the lower court had no jurisdiction. The same INEC speaking with the other side of their mouths said no, even though they agreed with the appellant that the federal high court had no jurisdiction. They asked that our appeal should be struck out which we had replied to.\n\n\"INEC had no option but was forced to withdraw their objection, asking that Sowore\u2019s appeal be struck out.

          "text": "The government of the United Kingdom has made a U-turn on its treatment of members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), recognising Nigeria\u2019s classification of the group as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn a May 2022 update of its asylum policy, seen by TheCable, the UK government excluded members of the group from seeking refuge in England.\n\nTheCable had reported in April 2021 that the UK was planning to grant asylum to persecuted members of the separatist group, as part of its refugee policy published at the time.\n\nThe policy, at the time, was for asylum to be granted to \u201cpersecuted\u201d members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB)\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UKVI, a division of the Home Office, directed its decision makers to consider if a person \u201cwho actively and openly supports IPOB is likely to be at risk of arrest and detention, and ill-treatment which is likely to amount to persecution\u201d.\n\nIf the person can prove persecution, then the IPOB member or supporter could be granted asylum.\n\nUKVI TAKES DOWN POLICY NOTES\n\nA few days after the policy notes were published, the UK government took it down, following complaints from the Nigerian government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 2021, an updated policy on asylum was seen by TheCable, with no clear mention of IPOB, but more emphasis on Nigerians fleeing Boko Haram\u2019s onslaught.\n\nThe UK said at the time that it would offer protection to \u201cwomen, LGBTI persons and non-indigenes\u201d who \u201cmay face additional discrimination which prevents them from being able to access effective protection\u201d.\n\nThe UK government said Nigerians could now claim asylum in the UK if they face \u201cfear of persecution and/or serious harm by members of Boko Haram because of\u201d their \u201cactual or perceived opposition to the group\u201d.\n\nUKVI RECOGNISES IPOB AS TERRORIST ORGANISATION\n\nIn its May 2022 policy update seen by TheCable, UKVI referred to IPOB as a terrorist organisation to be excluded from its asylum programme over alleged links to violence in the south-east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed as a terrorist group by the Nigerian government, and members of the group and its paramilitary wing \u2013 the Eastern Security Network (created in December 2020) \u2013 have reportedly committed human rights violations in Nigeria,\u201d UKVI said in its policy notes.\n\nIt added that \u201cMASSOB has been banned, but is not a proscribed terrorist group in Nigeria. It too has reportedly been involved in violent clashes with the authorities\u201d.\n\nUKVI went on to tell its decision makers that \u201cif a person has been involved with IPOB (and/or an affiliated group), MASSOB or any other \u2018Biafran\u2019 group that incites or uses violence to achieve its aims, decision makers must consider whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses under the Refugee Convention is applicable.\n\n\u201cPersons who commit human rights violations must not be granted asylum,\u201d the UK added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe policy brief noted that anyone excluded in this manner is also \u201cexcluded from a grant of humanitarian protection\u201d.\n\nUKVI also advised that \u201cdecision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each case\u2019s specific facts\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the last update in July 2021, Nnamdi Kanu, leader of IPOB and a UK citizen, has been in the custody of the Nigerian government on the grounds of allegations, including treason.\n\nIn its 2022 new year message, the group said the Nigerian national anthem will no longer be sung across schools in the southeast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuspected IPOB members were also recently killed by the Nigerian Army in a gun battle on Orlu\u2013Orsu road in April.",

          "text": "The government of the United Kingdom has made a U-turn on its treatment of members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), recognising Nigeria\u2019s classification of the group as a terrorist organisation.\n\nIn a May 2022 update of its asylum policy, seen by TheCable, the UK government excluded members of the group from seeking refuge in England.\n\nTheCable had reported in April 2021 that the UK was planning to grant asylum to persecuted members of the separatist group, as part of its refugee policy published at the time.\n\nThe policy, at the time, was for asylum to be granted to \u201cpersecuted\u201d members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB)\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe UKVI, a division of the Home Office, directed its decision makers to consider if a person \u201cwho actively and openly supports IPOB is likely to be at risk of arrest and detention, and ill-treatment which is likely to amount to persecution\u201d.\n\nIf the person can prove persecution, then the IPOB member or supporter could be granted asylum.\n\nUKVI TAKES DOWN POLICY NOTES\n\nA few days after the policy notes were published, the UK government took it down, following complaints from the Nigerian government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 2021, an updated policy on asylum was seen by TheCable, with no clear mention of IPOB, but more emphasis on Nigerians fleeing Boko Haram\u2019s onslaught.\n\nThe UK said at the time that it would offer protection to \u201cwomen, LGBTI persons and non-indigenes\u201d who \u201cmay face additional discrimination which prevents them from being able to access effective protection\u201d.\n\nThe UK government said Nigerians could now claim asylum in the UK if they face \u201cfear of persecution and/or serious harm by members of Boko Haram because of\u201d their \u201cactual or perceived opposition to the group\u201d.\n\nUKVI RECOGNISES IPOB AS TERRORIST ORGANISATION\n\nIn its May 2022 policy update seen by TheCable, UKVI referred to IPOB as a terrorist organisation to be excluded from its asylum programme over alleged links to violence in the south-east.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIPOB is proscribed as a terrorist group by the Nigerian government, and members of the group and its paramilitary wing \u2013 the Eastern Security Network (created in December 2020) \u2013 have reportedly committed human rights violations in Nigeria,\u201d UKVI said in its policy notes.\n\nIt added that \u201cMASSOB has been banned, but is not a proscribed terrorist group in Nigeria. It too has reportedly been involved in violent clashes with the authorities\u201d.\n\nUKVI went on to tell its decision makers that \u201cif a person has been involved with IPOB (and/or an affiliated group), MASSOB or any other \u2018Biafran\u2019 group that incites or uses violence to achieve its aims, decision makers must consider whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses under the Refugee Convention is applicable.\n\n\u201cPersons who commit human rights violations must not be granted asylum,\u201d the UK added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe policy brief noted that anyone excluded in this manner is also \u201cexcluded from a grant of humanitarian protection\u201d.\n\nUKVI also advised that \u201cdecision makers must, however, still consider all claims on an individual basis, taking into account each case\u2019s specific facts\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the last update in July 2021, Nnamdi Kanu, leader of IPOB and a UK citizen, has been in the custody of the Nigerian government on the grounds of allegations, including treason.\n\nIn its 2022 new year message, the group said the Nigerian national anthem will no longer be sung across schools in the southeast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuspected IPOB members were also recently killed by the Nigerian Army in a gun battle on Orlu\u2013Orsu road in April.",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

In exchange, they receive feedback while being interrogated by the audience.\n\nTo attend this month\u2019s edition, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nElon Musk\u2019s plan to charge governments and businesses to use Twitter\n\nNorebase\u2019s $1 million seed\n\nGoogle shutting down YouTube Go\n\nMasa Finance\u2019s $3.5 million pre-seed\n\nGovernments and businesses might soon pay to use Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you think I was joking when I said, \u201cTwitter may never be the same again\u201d? Well, today\u2019s update provides more clarity to my previous post.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 3, 2022, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, announced that Twitter might charge a \u201cslight\u201d fee for commercial and government users. This is part of Musk\u2019s effort to boost revenue, which has lagged behind larger competitors like Meta platforms.\n\nBut isn\u2019t this at odds with his primary interest in Twitter, which has to do with the company\u2019s censorship of free speech?\n\nEven though Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition has not yet been completed, recall that he agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion in a deal funded by $21 billion of his own money, $12.5 billion borrowed against his Tesla shareholding, and the remainder covered by bank loans.\n\nIt appears the estimated termination fee of $1 billion associated with the funding has fueled speculation that Musk will impose fees on the platform and cut costs to make the transaction financially viable.\n\nPer Reuters, Musk told banks that to cut costs, he would develop new ways to monetise tweets and tighten executive pay. Also, he planned to develop features to increase business revenue, including new ways to monetise tweets that contain important information or go viral.\n\nCurrently, Twitter has 229 million daily users around the world. Interestingly, at the annual Met Gala in New York on Monday, May 2, 2022, Musk said he wants to broaden Twitter\u2019s reach beyond its current \u201cniche\u201d and would like a much larger percentage of the American population to be on it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you think this means for you and me outside the United States? Maybe it\u2019s nothing. Perhaps I\u2019m the one reading meaning into it.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear how much Musk intends to charge businesses and governments or whether certain groups, like non-profits and journalists, will be exempt from imposed fees.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nNorebase\u2019s $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorebase, an African trade technology company, has raised $1 million in seed funding.\n\nSamurai Incubate and Consonance Investment led the round. Also, Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad), Kinfolk VC, Future Africa, Ventures Platform, Microtraction, Boleh Capital, Voltron Capital, Wuri Ventures, and Afropreneur participated.\n\nLaunched by Adetola Onayemi and Tope Obanla in September 2021, Norebase enables founders and businesses to launch and scale across multiple African countries at the same time or regularly.\n\nWhat does this mean? \u201cWhat Norebsase is doing for you is simple \u2014 we are providing you with the digital infrastructure for you to register, start, and scale your business in any African country. The idea is to build a digital infrastructure that ensures that anybody can actually just get into either their own market or another market without too much of a hassle,\u201d Onayemi once told Techpoint Africa.\n\nTo have a better understanding of how Norebase works, read the chat Ogheneruemu had with Onayemi here: What borderless expansion looks like for African startups with Norebase\n\nMoreover, Norebase claims to have delivered 100% month-on-month growth in transaction volumes over the last six months in terms of traction. During the same period, revenue increased by 40% month after month.\n\nThe funds will be used to improve Norebase\u2019s plug-and-play API, expand its trademark registration technology stack, and hire more people.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Norebase also launched its Incorporation API \u2014 a plug-and-play service \u2014 that allows other businesses, like payment processors and banks, to provide incorporation services to their customers.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, Ogheneruemu explained how the API works. You can listen to it here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report has been released and below are some of the highlights of the report:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can download the report here.\n\nGoogle to shut down YouTube Go\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 3, 2022, Google announced that YouTube Go would be shut down permanently in August 2022. It was introduced in 2016 to serve users in areas with limited connectivity, data prices, and low-end devices.\n\nAccording to Google, since its launch, \u201cYouTube has invested in improvements to the main YouTube app that make it perform better in these environments, while also delivering a better user experience that is inclusive of our entire community.\u201d\n\nI can sense some D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu: Earlier this year, Google gave a similar reason when it announced the discontinuation of Chrome\u2019s data-saving Lite mode.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that Google revealed in 2020 that YouTube Go had over 500 million downloads, making it one of the platform\u2019s most popular apps. Also, in December 2021, Google redesigned the UI for Android 12 Go, among other things.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for YouTube Go users? Google advises YouTube Go users to download the main YouTube app or visit youtube.com in their browsers.\n\nWhat do YouTube Go users who want to switch to the YouTube app benefit? Compared to YouTube Go, the main YouTube app offers a better overall user experience and includes features that the former does not.\n\nYouTube Go users, for example, are unable to comment, post, use dark mode, or create content within the app. They can now use the main YouTube app to access all of YouTube Go\u2019s missing features.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Google stated that it is developing new user controls to help viewers with limited data usage reduce their mobile data usage.\n\nUntitled Design Conference (UDC 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UDC 2022 is a full-day hybrid conference being curated for designers of all levels and specialisations, with a projection of over 500 designers to be in attendance.

The rapid growth of cryptocurrency over the last few years makes investing in digital currency so appealing to many. But, with all the options available in the market, why should investors choose Mushe? The most significant advantage is that Mushe can connect with any blockchain and is compatible with different platforms offering investors the flexibility to buy and trade without restrictions. This is uncommon as most tokens are only compatible with their host platform.\n\nMushe prioritizes a safer, easier, and faster experience for token holders. A bonus is that investors can expect low transaction fees. On average, XMU tokens will have some of the lowest transaction fees available. Mushe can keep its transaction fees low because the speed and scalability of its networks prevent congestion. To put it simply, competitors charge higher fees when there is more traffic on their platform or heavier transactions such as swapping tokens or minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Mushe\u2019s fee structure is different. It is simple to understand, and the fees are at a lower cost than Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other competitors.\n\nCrypto enthusiasts can purchase the tokens now for the pre-sale price of $0.005 per token exclusively at www.mushe.world. After it officially launches in July, the targeted price will be $0.05 per token.\n\nIn many crypto circles, it has become common consensus that now is the perfect time for investors to consider using XMU to grow their personal wealth and as part of their retirement portfolio.\n\nCryptocurrency, a tool for early retirement\n\nA key factor of cryptocurrency is the concept of decentralization which helps place the power in the hands of investors. Financial experts recommend investing in cryptocurrency as a crucial part of a long-term portfolio. They typically encourage having 5% of your portfolio in a high-risk asset such as cryptocurrency. For some investors, such as those who are part of the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement, putting in a higher percentage, such as 15%, may align better with their financial plan.\n\nThe FIRE movement is popular among millennials. It is based on the concept of saving up to 70% of your annual income to retire before the usual retirement age with enough savings to last your lifetime. Those who participate in this movement save and invest their money into assets that can generate a passive income. Eventually, the passive income will replace their monthly income allowing them to retire from full-time employment.\n\nCryptocurrencies are investment assets that can grow over a long-term period. When investing in crypto, financial experts recommend following the same rules as investing in the stock market \u2013 don\u2019t make emotional decisions or sell on a downswing, and don\u2019t purchase more than you can safely lose.\n\nBuilding personal wealth through Crypto\n\nCryptocurrencies have outperformed traditional investments in recent history, including large tech companies such as Netflix, which has experienced a 420% growth in five years, as reported by Business Insider. Most of the more prominent cryptocurrencies have a percentage growth at least three times greater during the same period. Mushe is expected to be a high-performing cryptocurrency based on its limitless scalability and interoperability. Investors that purchase Mushe tokens to hold in their portfolio for a long-term period can expect significant growth.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration: https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

The facility is fully furnished, and equipped with modern ICT infrastructure, which include SMART Interactive Boards, 100 computers with licensed software, a customised e-Learning Portal for access to online courses and training among other state-of-the art fixtures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Centre will promote teaching and learning of ICT education and will provide a conducive learning environment to scholars and researchers alike. With its frontline technological facilities, the Centre will give students, lecturers, and researchers the resources and connectivity to keep them in step with global ICT practice and advancement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its ICT functionality, the Centre has been deliberately designed by the Project Sponsors (NNPC & SNEPCo) and the Contractor (The Offshore Lab) to promote good citizenship, value orientation and energy sustainability through the integration of features such as:\n\nDedicated cycling infrastructure with bicycles donated to the Centre; An outdoor collaboration garden with canopy trees, branded seats, wi-fi access and recycling bins; Trees and gardens including 28 king palm trees, 10 canopy trees, flower beds and grass around the building\u2019s perimeter Bold signage and access strategy including \u2013 disabled parking area and ramp access, pedestrian routes, speed limit signs, safety and directional signs etc.\n\nThe ICT Centre is also equipped with a 3D Printer, and associated academic materials, to introduce the University\u2019s students to advancements in the additive manufacturing space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Emeka Obiwulu, CEO of The Offshore Lab (Project Contractor):\n\n\u201cOur saturated labour market struggles to cope with the 600,000-plus graduates produced yearly by Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institutions. This is a large army of energetic youth that could either end up as national assets or national liabilities, depending on how well the energy and potential of this group is harnessed.\n\nTransformational projects as the FUPRE ICT Lab have therefore become very necessary to address some of these national issues, through the provision of infrastructure, equipment and learning required to incubate tomorrow\u2019s tech entrepreneurs, engineers, freelancers, and employers of labour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also the fact to consider, of the rapidly growing tech space (and correspondingly growing investment potential) in Nigeria, which requires deliberate strategies to adequately upskill the resource pool necessary to support and sustain the growth of this sector. The ICT Centre is a perfect material example of such a strategy.\n\nMy team and I are grateful to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and to Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo), for the opportunity to serve and deliver a project of such strategic importance\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "Only war-torn Somalia and Yemen\u2019s governments are expected to earn less money relative to their economic size than Nigeria in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) estimate.\n\nNigeria is in bad company here with Somalia and war-torn Yemen, the only countries where the government collects less than 7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in revenue. On average, revenue to GDP ratio in frontier markets is slightly more than double of that while in South Africa, it\u2019s nearly 30 percent.\n\n\u201cThis looks like almost no one pays tax in Nigeria,\u201d said Charles Robertson, the chief economist at Renaissance Capital. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been told in Lagos by business people that the tax burden is far higher than these numbers suggest.\u201d\n\nA low revenue to GDP is an indicator that a government is not collecting its fair share of taxes from economic activity.\n\nThe Nigerian government has intensified efforts to boost its tax income since the drastic slump in oil revenues, which had sustained the economy for many years, in 2016.\n\nLittle progress has been made six years later. Policies like the one-off Voluntary Asset and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), which was supposed to add $1 billion to the federal purse, fell flat on its face. Zainab Ahmed, the finance minister, said last year that the scheme raked in N70 billion ($167.8 million), 16 percent of the target.\n\nThe government also raised the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate by 50 percent to 7.5 percent. The money from that has not, however, been able to make much of a difference, subdued by weak consumer purchasing power and an economy fresh off a COVID-induced recession.\n\nThe irony here, however, is that while the official numbers suggest the government collects less than half in taxes as a percentage of GDP compared to 2011 (when it was 17.7 percent), Nigerians are paying more taxes. Only that it is informal and to non-state actors.\n\n\u201cNigerians pay a lot of taxes but the government collects so little because Nigerians not only pay formal taxes, but also pay informal taxes and implicit taxes,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, a partner and head of tax and regulatory services at consulting firm PwC Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the formal taxes are the ones that result in a 6 percent tax-to-GDP ratio that is well known, and that itself is low because there\u2019s a lot of inefficiency in the design of the tax system.\n\n\u201cWe duplicate collecting agencies, use consultants with very unreasonable commissions and we have multiple taxes that are all over the place creating apathy,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nHe said in its attempt to improve its tax income, the government had been more focused on increasing the formal tax base rather than finding a way to tax the informal economy and curbing the revenue lost to non-state actors collecting taxes.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio sits at 6.3 percent, which is lower than the average of 30 African countries as surveyed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2018 by 10.2 percentage points (16.5 percent) and also lower than the Latin America and the Caribbean (23.1 percent).\n\nWhat this implies is that Nigeria\u2019s tax base has been on a steady decline due to growing unemployment rates. The highest tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria was 9.6 percent in 2011, with the lowest being 5.3 percent in 2016.\n\nA major reason for the low tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria is the large size of its informal economy, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be around 65 percent of the GDP, which is higher than the sub-Saharan average of 34 percent.\n\nBy comparison, the informal economy in Europe is 23 percent of its GDP, and 17 percent of the GDP in OECD countries.\n\nDespite repeated attempts by tax authorities to tax the informal sector, there has not been much success due to challenges including the lack of information on businesses in the sector, lack of documentation and proper regulation.\n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of businesses in the informal sector make it difficult for them to be taxed: the ease of starting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the informal sector means that the businesses might not be legally registered, making it hard to assess for tax purposes.\n\nAdditionally, a prevalence of informal funding rather than structured loans for these businesses to start or expand further reduces the obligation for business registration and information available to the tax authorities or regulators. Then, poor bookkeeping practices by MSMEs, even legally registered ones, complicates the process of assessing them for tax purposes.\n\nRead also: Explainer: How taxes, surcharges drive up airfares in Nigeria\n\nAs a result, tax authorities end up using bank account transactions and receipts to assess the businesses for tax purposes, exposing them to punitive tax assessments, liabilities and audits. Physical MSMEs are at greater risk of multiple taxation and levies by agencies at all levels of governments. Local governments, for example, are notorious for using force through task forces and touts to compel such businesses to pay their taxes.\n\nThis method of tax collection worsens tax compliance by creating distrust between the MSMEs and the government, and leading the MSMEs to view the approach of government as a lack of support for MSMEs rather than as a drive for improved tax compliance.\n\nThe increasing adoption of social media for commerce and remote working will further complicate the ability of tax authorities to assess MSMEs for the purposes of tax compliance, even when some of the businesses exceed the N25 million threshold, beyond which businesses have to pay taxes.\n\nHowever, although tax authorities struggle with tax compliance with the informal sector, a 2021 report by Lagos-based consulting firm, SBM Intel, found that businesses in the informal sector pay taxes, often to one agency on a more frequent basis and with the taxes forming a larger proportion of their incomes in the same time period compared to taxes on the formal sector.\n\nThe report stated that 98 percent of businesses in the informal sector actually pay taxes.\n\nWith oil income dwindling and Nigeria unable to benefit from higher oil prices, the urgency to improve tax income by incorporating the informal sector should take a new dimension, according to Muda Yusuf, CEO of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe government must, however, convince the people that it can utilise tax revenues efficiently and not burn it on subsidies for instance,\u201d he said.\n\nTax experts surveyed by BusinessDay say that the government must also tackle multiple taxation to successfully incorporate the informal sector into the tax base of the country.\n\nThe report by SBM Intelligence noted that the informal sector could be incorporated into the formal net if the process of administering Tax Identification Numbers were and tax administration simplified.",

Only that it is informal and to non-state actors.\n\n\u201cNigerians pay a lot of taxes but the government collects so little because Nigerians not only pay formal taxes, but also pay informal taxes and implicit taxes,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, a partner and head of tax and regulatory services at consulting firm PwC Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the formal taxes are the ones that result in a 6 percent tax-to-GDP ratio that is well known, and that itself is low because there\u2019s a lot of inefficiency in the design of the tax system.\n\n\u201cWe duplicate collecting agencies, use consultants with very unreasonable commissions and we have multiple taxes that are all over the place creating apathy,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nHe said in its attempt to improve its tax income, the government had been more focused on increasing the formal tax base rather than finding a way to tax the informal economy and curbing the revenue lost to non-state actors collecting taxes.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio sits at 6.3 percent, which is lower than the average of 30 African countries as surveyed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2018 by 10.2 percentage points (16.5 percent) and also lower than the Latin America and the Caribbean (23.1 percent).\n\nWhat this implies is that Nigeria\u2019s tax base has been on a steady decline due to growing unemployment rates. The highest tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria was 9.6 percent in 2011, with the lowest being 5.3 percent in 2016.\n\nA major reason for the low tax-to-GDP ratio in Nigeria is the large size of its informal economy, estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be around 65 percent of the GDP, which is higher than the sub-Saharan average of 34 percent.\n\nBy comparison, the informal economy in Europe is 23 percent of its GDP, and 17 percent of the GDP in OECD countries.\n\nDespite repeated attempts by tax authorities to tax the informal sector, there has not been much success due to challenges including the lack of information on businesses in the sector, lack of documentation and proper regulation.\n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of businesses in the informal sector make it difficult for them to be taxed: the ease of starting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the informal sector means that the businesses might not be legally registered, making it hard to assess for tax purposes.\n\nAdditionally, a prevalence of informal funding rather than structured loans for these businesses to start or expand further reduces the obligation for business registration and information available to the tax authorities or regulators. Then, poor bookkeeping practices by MSMEs, even legally registered ones, complicates the process of assessing them for tax purposes.\n\nRead also: Explainer: How taxes, surcharges drive up airfares in Nigeria\n\nAs a result, tax authorities end up using bank account transactions and receipts to assess the businesses for tax purposes, exposing them to punitive tax assessments, liabilities and audits. Physical MSMEs are at greater risk of multiple taxation and levies by agencies at all levels of governments. Local governments, for example, are notorious for using force through task forces and touts to compel such businesses to pay their taxes.\n\nThis method of tax collection worsens tax compliance by creating distrust between the MSMEs and the government, and leading the MSMEs to view the approach of government as a lack of support for MSMEs rather than as a drive for improved tax compliance.\n\nThe increasing adoption of social media for commerce and remote working will further complicate the ability of tax authorities to assess MSMEs for the purposes of tax compliance, even when some of the businesses exceed the N25 million threshold, beyond which businesses have to pay taxes.\n\nHowever, although tax authorities struggle with tax compliance with the informal sector, a 2021 report by Lagos-based consulting firm, SBM Intel, found that businesses in the informal sector pay taxes, often to one agency on a more frequent basis and with the taxes forming a larger proportion of their incomes in the same time period compared to taxes on the formal sector.\n\nThe report stated that 98 percent of businesses in the informal sector actually pay taxes.\n\nWith oil income dwindling and Nigeria unable to benefit from higher oil prices, the urgency to improve tax income by incorporating the informal sector should take a new dimension, according to Muda Yusuf, CEO of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise.\n\n\u201cThe government must, however, convince the people that it can utilise tax revenues efficiently and not burn it on subsidies for instance,\u201d he said.\n\nTax experts surveyed by BusinessDay say that the government must also tackle multiple taxation to successfully incorporate the informal sector into the tax base of the country.\n\nThe report by SBM Intelligence noted that the informal sector could be incorporated into the formal net if the process of administering Tax Identification Numbers were and tax administration simplified.",

          "title": "Case study: 5 countries show how best to improve tax collection",
          "text": "A typical developing economy collects just 15 percent of GDP in taxes, compared with the 40 percent collected by a typical advanced economy. The ability to collect taxes is central to a country\u2019s capacity to finance social services such as health and education, critical infrastructure such as electricity and roads, and other public goods. Considering the vast needs of poor countries, this low level of tax collection is putting economic development at risk.\n\nHow can policymakers tackle this challenge? A look at successful reforms between 2004 and 2015 in five low-income and emerging market economies \u2014 which achieved some of the largest revenue gains after tax reform \u2014 offers some answers. The experiences of this diverse set of countries \u2014 Cambodia, Georgia, Guyana, Liberia, and Ukraine \u2014 show that, regardless of the constraints they face, countries can strengthen their capacity to collect tax revenue by pursuing reform strategies with certain distinct features. We focus here mainly on Georgia. By analysing what worked in that country we can draw lessons for what strategies other countries should consider.\n\nGeorgia offers a striking example of successful tax revenue reform. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the government struggled to collect tax revenue. By 2003, rampant corruption involving tax evasion, illegal tax credits, and theft of government tax revenue had left public finances in shambles. The government was no longer able to honour its obligations to public servants and pensioners, even though salaries and pensions were very low.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s sweeping tax reform was made possible after the 2003 Rose Revolution, which gave the new government a mandate to reform the economy and fight widespread corruption. The country\u2019s new leaders adopted a policy of zero tolerance for corruption, and the culture began to change, along with the laws.\n\nA revised tax code, passed in 2004, simplified the tax system, reduced rates, and eliminated a series of minor local taxes that had been generating little revenue (on pollution and gambling, for example). Only 7 of 21 taxes remained, and many of the rates were reduced.\n\nProgressive personal income tax rates (12 to 20 percent) were replaced with a flat rate of 20 percent, and the social security contribution tax rate was first reduced from 33 percent to 20 percent and then eliminated altogether. Corporate income was taxed at a flat rate of 15 percent, and the value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20 percent to 18 percent. The revenue lost from lower tax rates was made up through a broader tax base, better compliance, and stricter enforcement.\n\nThe government also made it easier to pay taxes by introducing measures such as an electronic tax filing system. In this way, technology both improved efficiency and reduced opportunities for corruption. In parallel, the government lowered the minimum capital required to start a business, which also generated more tax revenue.\n\nThe improvement in the country\u2019s ability to mobilize revenue between 2004 and 2011 is all the more impressive given the sharp reduction in tax rates. By 2008, Georgia\u2019s tax-revenue-to-GDP ratio had doubled to 25 percent.\n\nLessons for tax reform\n\nWhat does Georgia\u2019s experience teach us about how best to increase tax revenue? While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, there are a few lessons that can be drawn from Georgia\u2019s case as well as the experiences of the other four countries.\n\nHave a clear mandate. Governments with a clear mandate to reform the tax system often succeed. Georgia\u2019s comprehensive tax reform was feasible only after the country had reached a high degree of dysfunction, triggering a revolution.\n\nSimilarly, in Ukraine, the 2004 Orange Revolution was a catalyst for tax reform. And in 2003, Liberia initiated reform after the civil war had ended.\n\nSecure high-level political commitment and buy-in from all stakeholders. While a clear mandate is necessary, it is not sufficient. Many newly elected governments do have such a mandate, but not all of them reform. Therefore, political commitment at the highest level and broad buy-in are needed. Social dialogue enhances the likelihood of reforms being implemented and sustained.\n\nEffective communication with stakeholders that emphasises the intended benefits of reforms can help overcome resistance of vested interests. And compensating the losers has proved effective in winning public support for tax reform initiatives.\n\nSimplify the tax system and curb exemptions. A simpler tax system with a limited number of rates is critical to fostering taxpayer compliance, as seen in the Georgia example. Notably, in fragile states, focus first on simplifying taxes, procedures, and structures. Simplicity of the tax system and legislation is the guiding principle for fragile states. This makes tax administration less challenging in weak states that lack such basic institutions as security and a well-functioning judicial system.\n\nLiberia is a case in point. Following its emergence from civil war, Liberia introduced taxes on turnover or import values, such as the goods and services tax, excises, and customs tariffs, underpinned by simple tax legislation.\n\nCurbing exemptions can also reduce the tax system\u2019s complexity while boosting revenue by broadening the tax base. Many countries incur a sizable loss of revenue through ill-designed exemptions, such as costly tax holidays and other incentives that fail to attract investment. And discretionary granting of exemptions provides opportunities for corruption.\n\nReducing exemptions figured prominently in nearly all five countries. Guyana, for example, implemented a comprehensive exemption reform with main elements that included eliminating the power of the finance minister to grant discretionary exemptions, publishing exemptions annually, and limiting income tax holidays to every 5 or 10 years, depending on the sector.\n\nReform indirect taxes on goods and services. The VAT has proved to be an efficient and strong revenue booster: countries that impose this tax tend to raise more revenue than those that don\u2019t (Keen and Lockwood 2010). In addition to reducing the rate, Georgia streamlined its VAT refund mechanism, allowing revenue from this source to rise from 8.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 11.5 percent in 2009.\n\nGuyana successfully introduced a VAT on January 1, 2007, despite significant challenges in the preparatory work, including setting up the new VAT department with fully trained staff, putting in place the supporting IT system and procedures, and training potential registrants and practitioners. The VAT was broad-based, with a single rate of 16 percent and a limited number of exemptions for financial, medical, and educational services. As part of its reform, Ukraine also curbed VAT exemptions and revised the regime for agriculture by reducing the rate and eliminating refunds.\n\nIncreases in excise and sales taxes are the simplest measures because they can raise revenue fairly quickly without fundamental changes to the tax system. For example, Guyana in 2015 took advantage of the decline in the international price of oil to raise fuel excise taxes. This step buoyed revenue during the country\u2019s economic slowdown. Similarly, Liberia broadened the scope of its goods and services tax while raising excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.\n\nIntroduce comprehensive tax administration reforms\n\nSuccessful revenue mobilisation cases tend to take a more holistic approach to modernising tax institutions. In all five case studies, revenue administration reforms figured prominently and covered a broad spectrum of legal, technical, and administrative measures, such as\n\nManagement, governance, and human resources: Four of the five countries implemented some management and governance changes. Georgia gradually recruited new tax and customs officers and phased out the old ones as part of its anti-corruption reform.\n\nEstablishment of large taxpayer offices: A large taxpayer office allows a country to focus tax compliance efforts on the biggest taxpayers, as Cambodia has done.\n\nThese offices also support good tax administration; they often pilot new tax and customs procedures before their rollout to the broader population.\n\nSmart use of information management systems: Successful revenue mobilisation hinges on managing information and leveraging the power of big data to improve compliance and fight corruption. Most of the countries studied have taken advantage of IT systems to leapfrog their revenue mobilisation reforms.\n\nRead also: Explainer: How taxes, surcharges drive up airfares in Nigeria\n\nGeorgia has automated most processes, including e-filing. It has also instituted a system for information sharing among tax authorities, taxpayers, and banks, as well as a one-stop Internet portal. Cambodia, Guyana, and Liberia have likewise computerised the administration of their taxes and customs.\n\nMore modern registration, filing, and management of payment obligations: All five countries have sought to establish or modernise basic rules and processes in these key compliance areas. For instance, Guyana implemented a unique system of taxpayer-identification numbers and streamlined its process.\n\nIt also introduced income tax withholding, a measure critical to fostering compliance. Enhanced audit and verification programme: A risk-based audit, which links the likelihood and nature of an audit to the taxpayer\u2019s inherent risks, is the most effective type in terms of encouraging compliance.\n\nAll five countries have made this a key part of their revenue mobilisation strategy. Notably, Cambodia conducted risk-based audits of taxpayers at customs and of the 150 largest taxpayers and hired some 200 new auditors. Ukraine implemented a targeted audit program, improved the internal control of tax administration, fought fraudulent VAT claims, and developed an anti-smuggling programme at the customs office.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nAlthough the optimal timing and design of reform measures vary among countries, these five cases highlight some basic lessons. One such lesson is that countries that pursue revenue administration measures and tax policy reform in tandem tend to see much larger gains.\n\nBut countries must give tax reform time to bear fruit. The duration of the reform episodes ranged from two to seven years. Sustained success requires institutional change, which happens only gradually.\n\nThe revenue increase in each of the five countries was impressive and averaged at least 1 percent of GDP a year over the reform period. This is consistent with the quantitative tax revenue objective over the four- to six-year time horizon recently advocated by the IMF\u2019s Vitor Gaspar and Abebe Selassie. In Georgia, the revenue gains averaged 2.5 percent of GDP a year, as was the case in Ukraine. Moreover, all five countries sustained the revenue gains in the five years after the reform episodes, confirming the quality of the measures put in place.\n\nThese five cases clearly show that large tax revenue mobilisation can be achieved and sustained. Although reform must be tailored to individual circumstances, three lessons stand out: tax reform requires first and foremost a broad social and political commitment; it rests on broad-based strategies that recognise that what and whom to tax should go hand in hand with how to tax; and it should be developed with the longer view in mind.\n\nThis article was first published in 2018.\n\nBernardin Akitoby is an assistant director in the IMF\u2019s Fiscal Affairs Department.",

          "title": "They claim Buhari has done nothing. UN scribe, Antonio Gutteres, says not so",
          "text": "By Femi Adesina\n\nThe Yoruba people of South-west Nigeria have a saying: when a child rejects instructions at home, it is from outside that such child is trained.\n\nAnd that was exactly what happened on Tuesday and Wednesday, this week, when United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Gutteres visited Nigeria as part of a three nations African tour. He said it was \u201ca visit of solidarity with all Nigerians, particularly the victims of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe UN Scribe was visiting Nigeria for the first time, and he had probably fallen for the antics of the Western media, and some unpatriotic Nigerians who have nothing good to say about their own country. They even visit the UN and parliaments of leading countries of the world, to de-market Nigeria.\n\nGutteres had probably thought he was coming to a country where hopelessness and despondency were order of the day. He started from Maiduguri, Borno State, once the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency in the country. When he saw what the Muhammadu Buhari administration, in conjunction with the Babagana Zulum government had done, he had a quick rethink.\n\nAt a meeting with President Buhari on Wednesday afternoon in Abuja, he declared: \u201cI was extremely surprised. The image that exists is of a hopeless situation. But what I saw was a Borno of hope.\u201d\n\nI chuckled as the international public servant expressed his consternation. He said he visited a centre where former Boko Haram fighters were being rehabilitated, and also camps of internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to provide a vision of the future for the people. Vision of jobs, schools, health institutions, and the like. And that was what was being done. It is a remarkably wise and well conceived strategy.\u201d\n\nBut the naysayers, the wailing wailers, always say President Buhari has not achieved anything in the country. They see roads, rail, bridges, airports, but they say he\u2019s not doing anything. Well, like the contumacious child, who refused to take instructions at home, an outsider has come to tell them the home truth.\n\nThey say Nigeria is good for nothing. Gutteres says the country \u201cis a pillar of continental and global cooperation-and a steadfast partner of the United Nations.\u201d He added: \u201cNigeria is a country where Africa\u2019s promise and potential come to vivid life.\u201d\n\nThat is the same country that a clergyman, who should inspire hope and faith, says has been broken, completely destroyed and thrown to the dustbin. Well, when a child refuses to take instructions from home\u2026\n\nThe UN scribe said Nigerians were fantastic people, and the country has \u201csolid institutions, and a vibrant private sector.\u201d But that is not what some ever cynical Nigerians say about their country, and that is not the picture they go abroad to paint of their country. Shame, I say again; shame.\n\nPresident Buhari said Boko Haram was the major security challenge his administration inherited in 2015. \u201cThey will kill people, and shout \u2018Allah Akbar,\u2019 (meaning God is great). But when you do that it is either you do not know that God, or you are being stupid. God is justice, and you can\u2019t take an innocent soul, and say God is great.\n\n\u201cWe began to educate the people, and gradually, they understood that Boko Haram was not about religion. The group is largely decimated today, and government is trying to resettle the people. We are trying to get them back to the land, and things will get better in the near future.\u201d\n\nYet they say Buhari hasn\u2019t achieved anything. When your adversary sees your robust horse, standing in all its grandeur, he turns up his nose, and says; see this dwarf horse.\n\nThey have eyes and see nothing, they have ears and refuse to hear. Well, an outsider will one day come to tell them the truth.\n\nThe Secretary-General said the people he saw in Maiduguri \u201cremain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives.\u201d\n\nStill commending the Buhari administration, he welcomed \u201cthe establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Returns and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North-East.\u201d\n\nBut to some of our people, the country is broken, destroyed, and nothing is working. Well, when a child refuses to accept instructions given at home, an outsider knocks sense into his head eventually.\n\nHear Gutteres again: \u201cAnd I thanked President Buhari for his unwavering support of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Lake Chad Basin Commission.\u201d\n\nYet, to the permanent critics, Buhari is not doing anything, and has not achieved anything. I hear.\n\nIn 2011, Boko Haram bombed the United Nations building in Abuja, killed many people, and completely wrecked the structure. The Buhari administration undertook the rebuilding of the facility, and got it delivered in good time.\n\nThe Secretary-General described it as \u201can impressive edifice, \u201c stressing: \u201cI want to thank the Government and people of Nigeria for not only hosting the United Nations, but for rebuilding and reopening the United Nations House in Abuja in 2019 following the terrorist attacks in 2011.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an outsider appreciating the good works of the Buhari administration, which the willfully blind have refused to see, and the deliberately deaf have refused to hear. If a child stubbornly spurns instructions at home\u2026.\n\nLet\u2019s conclude with this very inspiring one from Mr Gutteres.\n\n\u201cMy trip to Nigeria is not to visit people in despair, but people filled with hope. When there\u2019s political vision, good things can happen.\u201d\n\nIf you have been deluded, brainwashed, hoodwinked into seeing your country as broken, destroyed, good for nothing, then begin to have a rethink. Those who fed you with that narrative have their own sinister agenda. Our country has challenges in security, economy, and other areas, yes, but it is neither broken nor destroyed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t say you are, nobody would say thou art.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari has worked for this country, and continues to work. Let not an outsider come and tell us the home truth that is right before our eyes.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "text": "\n\n\u2026says politics won\u2019t affect governance\n\n\u2026to fix Inisa, Okinni, Oba Ile, Oba Oke, others\n\nAs part of his administration\u2019s efforts to further raise the bar of infrastructure, enhance standard of living and set Osun on the path of socioeconomic rejuvenation through massive infrastructural developments, the Governor of Osun, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Thursday flagged off the rehabilitation of Osogbo-Okinni-Ilobu-Ifon (9.8km) Federal Government road in the State.\n\nThe Governor also flagged off and ordered for immediate reconstruction, Ire-Akari-round-about-Erin Osun LCDA Junction road (3.21km) and Post Office-Aiyetoro-Jamodo Olufon Palace-Janta road in Ifon-Osun (2.1km) respectively.\n\nThe newly-awarded three major roads that fall within Osogbo/Olorunda/Irepodun/Orolu Federal Constituency and Egbedore Local Government Area, have been crying for intervention due to their deplorable condition and neglect over the years.\n\nThe roads have been in a state of disrepair for 13 years after the re-award of the contract for its rehabilitation by the Federal Government in 2013.\n\nThe state government awarded the roads project to Messrs. Slavabogu Construction Nigeria Limited in the sum of N3,265,623,449.00, with a completion period of 12 months.\n\nThis is even as the Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, members of the State and National Assemblies, Communities Leaders, among others extolled the government for considering the roads for reconstruction after so many years of agitation.\n\nGovernor Oyetola reassured the citizens that politics would not for any reason hamper governance as he is committed to completing ongoing projects, initiating new ones as well as consolidating on his monumental strides when he is returned for second term.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Governor Oyetola said the project was in fulfilment of his administration\u2019s avowed commitment to continue to grant development facilities to the people as promised, saying, \u201cThis is another delivery of the need that our people expressed during our Town Hall meetings\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the need to urgently reconstruct the roads was informed by the avoidable hardship being experienced by the residents of the State plying the roads on daily a basis.\n\n\u201cThese three roads, which have been in a deplorable condition over the years, have led to loss of several man-hours with the resultant negative effect on the social-economic activities in the State. It is our resolve to ensure that the relevant communities benefit from our infrastructure development efforts.\n\n\u201cThe contract for the rehabilitation of these roads was used to kick start the e-procurement process newly-adopted by the State Government with four Ministries as the pilot MDAS.\n\n\u201cI am glad to inform this gathering that the award of the Contract is transparent and open to all on the e-procurement platform of the State.\n\n\u201cMessrs. SlavaBogu Nig. Ltd., which scored the highest point, was awarded the Contract in the sum of N3,265,623,449.00.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer and hope that when completed, the people of the State shall use these roads for profitable business as well as for general social development of the area. It is my belief that as good motorable roads boost the development of an area, the socio-economic activities of the citizens around the road network will in no distant time witness a massive turnaround.\n\n\u201cI want to seize this opportunity to enjoin the contractor to deploy relevant machinery to ensure that the roads are delivered in record time and in good quality in line with the Conditions of Award and Quality Assurance.\n\n\u201cI would like to enjoin the citizens of the State to reciprocate the good gesture of the State Government by providing enabling environment for the contractor to do his job.\n\n\u201cThe flag-off of these roads today is a further confirmation of our belief that the path to sustainable socioeconomic development and service delivery is an endless one. It also lays credence to the fact that our administration is completely sold out to providing good governance for our people. It will also convince our people that there is no moment of drought in the four-year term You the People gave to us.\n\n\u201cI stand to confirm to you that as we gravitate towards completing this term, politics and governance will go hand in hand. It is also a clear indication that we shall continue to build a stable, strong and prosperous Osun that our people and prosperity shall be proud of.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of continuity and inclusive governance, we have constructed and rehabilitated scores of roads to transform our economy, some inherited and others initiated by us. These are proofs that ours is a government for all irrespective of political affiliation. We believe, and rightly so, that we were elected into office to do governance and not politics. We have demonstrated that governance is made strong when all and sundry benefit from government and have a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to you all to reciprocate this gesture by relating as one family in the interest of peace and equitable development so that we can all bequeath the Osun of our forefathers\u2019 dreams to prosperity.\n\n\u201cLet me also reiterate here that the roads we are flagging off today, though federal ones, span through five Local Government Areas, it has been in a state of disrepair for 13 years. After the re-award of the contract for its rehabilitation by the Federal Government in 2013, as a State, we made efforts to support the contractor which the Federal Government gave the contract to, yet, it did not yield any positive result.\n\n\u201cAnd because we are concerned about the suffering our people go through on these roads, we decided to take it over to put an end to the sufferings of our people. To meet the Federal Government\u2019s specification, the road shall have 1.5metres shoulders on both sides.\n\n\u201cApart from the roads project we are flagging off today, the Inisa township road, Baruwa, Halleluyah road, Okinni, Akinlalu, Apomu and Ilesa township road are all undergoing procurement process\u201d, he added.\n\nSpeaking in his palace when Mr. Governor paid him homage during the flag-off ceremony, the Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, hailed the Governor for deeming it worthy to reconstruct the road that has become almost a death trap to transporters and residents plying it.\n\nOba Olaniyan, who lamented the present deplorable state of the road, said if completed, it would go a long way to galvanise the socioeconomic and infrastructural development in the benefiting towns.\n\nHe expressed the readiness of his subjects to continuously support the Administration of Governor Oyetola who he described as lover of development.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commissioner for Works and Transport, Engr. Remi Omowaye, said the choice of the roads was hinged on their socioeconomic peculiarity to the State as it traverses and links several communities together.\n\nHe said the roads which have been abandoned for more than 13 years had caused serious setback, hence, the swift response by the state to address the menace not minding the fact that it belongs to the Federal Government.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Senator Bashir Ajibola; Member House of Representatives, Representing Osogbo Federal Constituency, Hon. Bukola Oyewo; Member, House of Assembly representing Irepodun/Orolu State Constituency, Hon. Nashiru Olateju; and Chairman, APC Council of Elders, Engr. Sola Akinwumi, lauded the Governor for the initiative, saying it would restore the economic value of the benefitting communities.\n\nSpeaking, the Executive Vice Chairman, Slavabogu Construction Nigeria Limited, the construction company handling the project, Madam Grace Omolori-Okoya, who was represented by the Quality Control Officer, Engr. Marwan Estephan, assured quality service delivery in record time.",

          "title": "Presidential ticket: Impose Jonathan lose 2023, APC North-South Coalition warns",
          "text": "Ahead of the primary election for the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a group under the aegis of APC North-South Patriotic Coalition (ANSPAC) has taken its protest to the national secretariat of the party, warning the party stands losing in 2023 if it imposed former President Goodluck Jonathan as its presidential candidate.\n\nThe protest which temporarily affected vehicular movement in and around the Buhari House APC national secretariat had several of the protesters carrying anti-Jonathan placards.\n\nJonathan\u2019s speculated bid\n\nThere have been media reports that former President Jonathan was perfecting plans to join the ruling party and vie for its presidential ticket.\n\nThis speculation gained further momentum when the former president told some youth who had come to urge him into the presidential race, that Nigerians would watch out for his next line of action in this regard.\n\n\u201cI cannot declare because some processes are still ongoing. Yes, you are calling on me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring. The political process is ongoing; just watch out. The key role you must play is that Nigeria must get somebody that will carry young people along,\u201d Jonathan had said while receiving Youth Compatriots of Nigeria April 22, 2022.\n\nHe was reacting to the remarks by spokesman of the group, Mayor Samuel, who had said: \u201cWe were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015.\n\n\u201cNow, we know better, under Jonathan, the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us; we have realised our mistakes; we want him back to complete what he started.\u201d\n\nThe protest\n\nBut reading a letter addressed to the APC national chairman to newsmen during the protest Thursday in Abuja, spokesman of the group, Alhaji Toyin Rahim, said the rumour had been around for some time that former President Jonathan of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was being wooed by some power players within the APC to join the party and fly its presidential ticket for the 2023 election.\n\nRahim said the Jonathan project cannot fly because it cannot help party, warning against \u201cfalling victim of ill-advised and action that can push the party out of power.\n\n\u201cOne of the most telling negative implications of such an action is that the APC does not have anyone of electoral value who can win election for us except we smuggle in a former president we defeated seven years ago for his glaring incompetence as president.\n\n\u201cIn APC today there are presidential aspirants with credible pedigrees and humongous electoral value and CBPaCity. It is not only unnecessary to smuggle Jonathan into our great party, it is also self-indicting and meaning that our party\u2019s performance in office has been worse than an administration that Nigerians thoroughly rejected and voted APC in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt will also be an indictment against His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari by making Nigerians believe that we lied to them when we said Jonathan performed woefully and that our dear President Muhammadu Buhari would do better. Are we now saying we lied to Nigerians and that we have now discovered that Jonathan was much better and that he should return to continue his good works that nobody can see?\u201d\n\nWhile demanding a categorical statement from the Adamu-led NWC, the group said: \u201cThose who are masterminding this project do not have the interest of the party at heart and certainly do not love Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat sense is in anyone bringing back someone we announced to the whole world that he was a failure and rejected by the overwhelming numbers of Nigerians and then we go back to start romancing him and make him our presidential flag bearer? That\u2019s self-inflicted disaster.\n\n\u201cWe demand immediate categorical statement from the party\u2019s leadership that such project to import and impose former president Goodluck Jonathan as APC\u2019s presidential candidate is not being contemplated. This demand represents overwhelming majority of opinions in the party across board nationwide.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, Amaechi, others pick forms\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo Osinbajo, Minister of Transportation Rotimi Ameachi, former Senate President Ken Nnamani and former running mate to Muhammadu Buhari in the 2011 general elections, Pastor Tunde Bakare, have picked N100 million nomination forms to contest the APC presidential ticket. The four aspirants have now joined the swelling list of those contesting APC presidential ticket.\n\nAside Bakare and Senator Nnamani who both appeared physically Thursday in Abuja at the International Conference Centre (ICC) venue to obtain the nomination forms, Osinbajo Ameachi were represented.\n\nOthers who have purchased the nomination forms include; Former Lagos state Governor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Senator Rochas Okorocha, Minister of state for Education Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of Niger Delta Godswill Akpabio, Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, Ebonyi state Governor Dave Umahi and Jigawa state Governor Abubakar Badaru.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen shortly after picking his nomination forms, Pastor Bakare promised to rebuild Nigeria on a four pillar- agenda of peace, prosperity, progress and possibilities.\n\n\u201cI trust God helping us with men of good will, East, West, North and South from the country across party lines, male and female who will rise up and rebuild our nation in such a way that the devastation we are experiencing we would see it again no more.\n\n\u201cOur program is very simple: Peace, prosperity, progress and possibilities. Upon those four pillars Nigeria will be rebuilt and the hope of many citizens will be rekindled. We are all going to join hands to make it happen. No other nation will fix our nation, it will take Nigerians from all works of life, within and without and those in the diaspora to join hands together to build our nation.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he was comfortable having many aspirants amidst power shifting agitations, Bakare said: \u201cGod rules in the affairs of men and He gives it to whoever He wills. A Southerner is a Nigerian, a Northerner is a Nigerian. We trust God that the best, the fittest and the most competent will emerge and the one who truly loves our people, especially the poor, will rise to fix our nation.\n\n\u201cMany people run in a race but only one person will wear the crown. There is only one seat, whoever wins the rest of us must rise to support him to rebuild Nigeria, East, West, North or South, Nigeria is our country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the immediate past governor of Ogun stat and lawmaker representing Ogun Central District, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has officially declared his intention to contest the APC presidential ticket.\n\nAmosun declares\n\nAmosun said if given the opportunity, his administration would prioritise human security as a fundamental principle to national security and economic development.\n\nHe said by addressing security and economic development, Nigeria would be better positioned to confront the root cause of the rampant killings, kidnapping and violence nationwide.\n\nThe ceremony which held at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, followed series of declarations by other presidential aspirants including former Akwa Ibom state Governor Godswill Akpabio, former Edo state Governor Adams Oshiomhole and Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi who was present at the event.\n\nWhile commending the Buhari administration for its achievements in the last seven years, Amosun said he\u2019s in the race to \u201cconsolidate on the ongoing processes by broadening and deepening, and where necessary, rebuilding the all-encompassing, coherent and comprehensive security structure to confront the numerous security challenges facing the country.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, I am formally announcing my candidacy for the Presidential ticket of our great party, the All Progressives Congress and the Presidency of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI do so conscious of the immensity of the tasks that lie ahead in our country and the magnitude of the sacrifices that anybody who wishes to lead our country into the next phase must make.\n\n\u201cThis is to honour a historic call and duty to lead the next phase of our collective journey to national glory. It is a duty to re-energise our faith in the future of this country even in the face of the threats to our national sovereignty by insurgents and terrorists; a duty to renew hope in our collective destiny even in the light of some doubts expressed and mobilised in some quaters about our shared fate.\u201d\n\nOn his preparedness to run, the lawmaker said his wide-ranging experiences in both private and public life, in the legislative and executive branches and at every level of government, had imbued him with the requisite insights, political vision, and understanding of the nature of Nigeria\u2019s diversity and economic management capacity.\n\nHe also boasted of an extensive network of relationships adequate to provide a leadership that would galvanise the country to achieve her manifest destiny as the leading black nation.\n\nUnveiling his six-point agenda for the country, Amosun said national security and economic development would take precedence in his effort to build a new Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will prioritise human security as the fundamental principle and ultimate goal of national security. Putting human security at the forefront and approaching human security as the directive principle of state policy would imply that the two dominant goals of my leadership would be national security and economic development.\n\n\u201cBy linking security and economic development, the country will be able to confront the underlying causes of the multiple threats to our national security.\u201d\n\n16 pick APC forms\n\nMeanwhile, as at close of work Thursday evening, about 16 persons have purchased nomination forms to contest the APC presidential ticket.\n\nAlso, Blueprint gathered that about 95 persons across the states obtained nomination forms to contest the party\u2019s governorship tickets nationwide.\n\nAccording to the statistics obtained exclusively, 241 persons have paid for Senate nomination forms, 821 others paid for the House of Representatives tickets while State House of Assembly number of aspirants now at 1505 persons nationwide.\n\nThose that have bought the N100 million forms for the presidential ticket include; Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Governor Yahaya Bello, Governor Dave Umahi, Senator Rochas Okorocha, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba, Barrister Uju Kennedy, Pastor Tunde Bakare, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Nicholas Bello, Governor John Kayode Fayemi, Rotimi Amaechi, Senator Ken Nnanami, Sen. Chris Ngige and governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar.\n\nThe party, has however, extended the Sale of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2023 General Elections to Tuesday, May 10, 2022.\n\nIn a revised timetable issued by the APC National Organising Secretary, Sulaiman Muhammad Argungu, the last day for submission of completed forms and accompanying documents is now set for Wednesday, 11th May, 2022.\n\nAlso, Congresses to elect Local Government Area (LGA), State and National Delegates now hold from Thursday, 12th May to Saturday, 14th May, 2022.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

As far as the committee was concerned, there were arguments that the presidential candidate should go to the South while some said it should go to the Northern part of the country.\u201d\n\nThe party, in a separate statement Thursday by its National Secretary, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, disclosed that the 96th NEC now holds Wednesday, May 11, 2022.\n\nAccording to the statement, the venue remains NEC Hall PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja at 2.00 pm.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe earlier date clashes with the Local Government Delegates Election involving all members of our party.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the party directed all members that its National Caucus meeting earlier scheduled to hold May 10, 2022, would now hold Wednesday, May 11, 2022.\n\nThe statement partly reads: \u201cVenue: Akwa Ibom State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Time: 10.00am.The change is as a result of the Local Government Delegates Election scheduled for May 10, 2022. All inconveniences are regretted.\u201d\n\nPloy to buy time \u2013 Source\n\nBut a top party source told Blueprint that the postponement \u201cbasically has to do with the need to carefully handle the party issues, particularly that around zoning. We are tactically delaying and buying time because we have to be very careful in the way we handle the zoning brouhaha. We must guard against any form of implosion.\n\n\u201cWe are making headway and some aspirants are beginning to express their readiness to abide by the party\u2019s position. That\u2019s to tell you the extent consultations had gone. It\u2019s hoped that by the time we hold the next meeting, the coast must have been clear and the party will be good to go as one indivisible entity into the 2023 contest.\u201d\n\nDiri speaks\n\nIn a related development, Bayelsa state Governor Douye Diri has said no region can produce the president of the country without the support of other regions.\n\nHe specifically stated that the demand of the southern governors that the presidency be zoned to the South cannot be achieved without the support of the North and vice versa.\n\nGovernor Diri spoke Thursday when a PDP presidential aspirant and Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed visited him in Government House Yenagoa.\n\nThe Bayelsa governor urged PDP members to collectively work for the success of the party in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nDiri noted that as an opposition party, what should be paramount is how to wrest power from the ruling party, which he said had lost grip of governance in all aspects.\n\nWhile restating the call for the PDP to zone the presidency to the South, Diri stressed the need for political offices to be rotated among different parts of the country to ensure equity, fairness and justice as exemplified by the PDP in its last national convention.\n\nThe Bayelsa helmsman, however, noted that God remained the ultimate decision maker on who becomes the PDP flag-bearer and that he would support whoever emerges as the party\u2019s choice.\n\nThe governor urged his Bauchi counterpart to speak on issues about the party and how to better the lot of Nigerians, saying the world and Nigerians were looking up to the PDP to salvage the country from total collapse occasioned by the bad governance of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe commended the humble disposition of Governor Mohammed and thanked him for starting his presidential declaration from the state.\n\n\u201cNigeria is waiting for PDP. Our party must be united and support whoever emerges. Even in our quest for a southern president, we need the north. We have to court the north, speak with the north and whoever that God so appoints to be the president.\n\n\u201cYou are one person this state has taken as our own. You have the goodwill of your people in Bayelsa state.\n\n\u201cBut let us all caution ourselves that we are in opposition. It appears some of us still do not understand that fact. We should be talking about we and not necessarily I. At the end of the day, the final decider is God. If God decides it won\u2019t be a president from the south, we cannot run away from that decision. We will stand by our party and work with that person.\n\n\u201cI am one person that has said so much about our party\u2019s offices to be rotational. That is what we did in the convention where we zoned offices. That is for fairness, justice and equity.\n\n\u201cI like to restate and re-emphasise that we need to be at the centre. Nigeria is falling apart and we need to rescue the country. The world is looking up to PDP for Nigeria to work again.\n\n\u201cBayelsa is your home. We are happy to receive you and equally happy that you are kicking off your presidential declaration from Bayelsa, your home state.\u201d\n\nBala on humility\n\nSpeaking earlier, Senator Mohammed had advised other PDP aspirants to be humble in the quest to get support for their presidential ambition.\n\nThe Bauchi governor, who described Bayelsa as his second home, noted that he was in the state to formally declare his intention to run for the presidency.\n\nAccording to him, as a democrat and having benefited from people all over Nigeria, he is not sectional and would support whoever emerges as the party\u2019s candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe called on other aspirants to close ranks and work together for the PDP to take over power at the centre.\n\nBala said: \u201cThose of us that have come out, let us have humility. We have to have the synergy and understanding that we are just stepping out because it is time for us to step out. We cannot be successful without everybody. We must synergise and fraternise.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I am stepping out to express my aspiration as a presidential aspirant. I have come to Bayelsa to meet our party, to say to the outside world for the first time that I am running for the presidency of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou know my public life and antecedents, I don\u2019t believe in sectionalism. I believe in justice, equity and fairness. I have benefited so much from Nigerian patriots from every part of the country. The one I have benefited most is from Bayelsa, who assisted me to come to national limelight. I will never take that for granted. That is why I am starting with Bayelsa. This is my home after Bauchi.\n\n\u201cI believe in Nigeria and if I am not there, whoever is the candidate, I will support. I respect people. I may not be the best.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. Luckily the people understood our message and it has made great impact,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari told the UN scribe that the government had started a gradual, but steady process of resettlement and reintegration where citizens get encouraged to return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.\n\nPresidency Nigeria\n\nThe President thanked Secretary General Antonio Gutress for the maiden visit to Nigeria.\n\nIn his remark, the UN Scribe, who had been in Borno State on Tuesday, said what he saw was a departure from the pictures of hopelessness and despair painted, adding that \u201cpeople exuded hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday, I visited Maiduguri where the United Nations is supporting the internally displaced. I was deeply moved by their stories and struggles. These include the struggles with hunger, with World Food Programme projecting 4.1m people in North East Nigeria to be food insecure in the upcoming lean season,\u201d he said.\n\nGuterres said the United Nations had called for an additional 351 million dollars as part of the overall 1.1 billion dollars for the humanitarian response plan for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut despite all they have seen and endured, the people I met remain hopeful and committed to returning to their communities and resuming their lives.\u201d \u2014\n\n@antonioguterres\n\n\u201cTo that end, I welcome the establishment of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Returns and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North East.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis spirit of hope amidst hardship \u2013 and solidarity in struggle \u2013 was also at the centre of my discussions with the Presidency today,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UN Scribe said discussions with President Buhari also touched on laying groundwork to ensure peaceful and democratic elections next year \u2013 and the full participation of Nigeria\u2019s women and young people.\n\nAt the media stakeout, the UN Secretary General told newsmen that measures to address security challenges in the country, Lake Chad and Sahel were discussed, which include the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel.",

Yahaya Bello is the one we will support. From all he has done for women and for his state in general, he is the one to beat. We will only support those who support us.\n\n\u201cIt has never happened before in the history of Nigeria for a leading presidential candidate to appoint a woman as the Director-General of his campaign.\u201d\n\nResponding, DG of the Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, said the dreams of her mother for a better Nigeria for Nigerian women would be actualized with a Yahaya Bello presidency.\n\n\u201cI am so happy that Nigerian women have decided, for once, to take their destinies in their hands by supporting that one Governor that has given them so much voice and has made the world to see how women can turn stone into bread in a troubled economy. He will do the same for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSeeing this huge honest crowd, I am confident that Yahaya Bello\u2019s good deeds, belief in women, and giant strides in a women-filled government, have earned him the trust of Nigerian women.
