          "text": "National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has urged the Federal Government to deploy software such as the union\u2019s e-tracking platform to help tackle insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Deputy General Secretary of NURTW, Mr Anthony Asogwa, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Sunday, that the platform would enable the union detect threats to vehicle of members.\n\nAccording to him, the union has concluded arrangements and can launch the platform before the end of the year or within the first quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nNigeria has the means to be able to engage any of the sophisticated software, which it can use in tracking the positions of criminals, because most of the times they are camped in the forest.\u201d\n\nArrangements have already been concluded by the union to introduce what we call e-tracking.\u201dIt is a platform we created and all our members will be logged into that platform,\u201cIf there is any threat or any issue, we will be able to detect it.\u201d\n\nIf your friends or relations are traveling and are on the platform, you can monitor the vehicle\u2019s movement at any point in time using the software.\u201d\n\nThis is why I said currently there are enough means to track criminality. With the platform, any of our vehicles that have ssues on the road, we will be able to monitor it and then make calls to the nearest police station.\n\nWe are collaborating with the police on this.\u201dWe hope to launch it between now and the first quarter of 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nNURTW also appealed to the Federal Government to increase its effort toward tackling insecurity on the roads to enable free movement of goods across the country.\n\nAsogwa told NAN that \u201cinasmuch as we know that the Federal Government is doing its best on the issue of security, it has to do more because the situation appears not to be getting better.\u201d\n\nAbout 90 per cent of transportation of goods and services in Nigeria are done by road.\u201d\n\nAnd because of insecurity on the roads, these goods and services cannot move freely to where they are needed and this impedes the economic growth of the country.\u201d\n\nThis situation doesn\u2019t seem to have improved as recently, even the train, which we considered the safest was attacked but God was merciful.\u201d\n\nSo we want to plead with the Federal Government to do more. I believe if they do more, the situation will be under control.\u201d\n\nThe secretary-general also decried the poor state of the Nigerian roads, saying that it enabled crime to thrive on the roads. \u201d\n\nWe have the issue of very bad condition of our roads. Some of these criminals stand at the bad portion of the road, knowing you will definitely slow down and when you do, they will attack.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Mr Taiwo Yahaya, the Secretary, Jabi Motor Park of NURTW also decried the poor state of the roads.\u201d\n\nWhen you are travelling through Ogbaja-Omo-Kabba in Kogi and it rains, you are bound to spend roughly six to seven hours on that road because of its poor state.\u201d\n\nI know the government is really trying but they have to do something and fast concerning the roads,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nFormer Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim, has said the only way Nigeria would progress is when it has peace at home and respect abroad.\n\nHe stated this in his vote of thanks on behalf of recipients of 2020 Zik Awards, yesterday. He was awarded Zik\u2019s prize on leadership, yesterday.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nAnyim said Nigeria must also effect changes in its leadership recruitment to bring in leaders that have vision and could keep pace with contemporary soco-economic and technological challenges that face the country.\n\nHe also said youths must be made the epicentre of nation-building efforts.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to survive and thrive, we must have peace at home and respect abroad. For that we need leaders that must connect and engage with the people, especially the youths. Such leaders must place the youths at the centre of every nation building effort in order to move from the current valley of despair to the height of their potential. Our leaders must be skilled in the science and art of good governance. They must be visionary and ready to keep pace with contemporary social, economic and technological challenges. They must be pragmatic and result driven in dealing with security, education, health and other myriad of challenges that confront our nation.\u201d\n\nAnyim said the problems of Nigeria were becoming more complex and required changes in leadership approach.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that the world is changing. Our problems are now monumental and more complex. Therefore, the demand of leadership in the present day Nigeria has become more daunting. The leadership approach that will cope with these challenges must be beyond the usual; such leadership must have vision and capacity, be determined and above all inclusive.\u201d\n\nHe charged Nigeria to begin to invest in youths, especially as the second quarter of the 21st century, 2026 \u2013 2050 approaches, a period he described as \u201cthe next phase of dramatic technological expansion and social change.\u201d\n\nHe said the period also known as Industry 4.0 would come with several artificial intelligence (AI) and technological innovations that would throw up more challenges for the country.\n\n\u201cIn the next 25 years, oil companies and oil exploration will continue to phase out. This will certainly depress economies that are oil dependant with consequential socio economic effects. For that we need leadership that understands the challenges, the imperatives and concomitant of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We need leaders that must connect and engage with the people especially the youth. Such leaders must place the youth at the centre of every nation building effort in order to move them from the current valley of despair to the height of potentials.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

They would think there is something better than us. Thank God we lost power. Today, Nigerian people know better.\n\n\u201cI believe we will re-energize the party and take over power again, not only at the centre, but in Nigeria, there is a lot of attention taking power at the federal level. There was time PDP was controlling more than 20 states.\n\n\u201cThat has been reduced to 13.

(NAN)\n\n7:03PM\n\nAnambra Election: Counting of Votes Under way Counting of votes has started in some polling units in Awka township after Saturday governorship election in Anambra. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that though voting began late in some polling units in Awka, the exercise was concluded about 3.30pm.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner. Nkwachukwu Orji said that this revised closing time applies to areas where Polling Units opened after the commencement period of 8.30am. In line with existing regulations and guidelines of the Commission, adding that any intending voter who is on the queue by 4.00 pm shall be allowed to vote. He said all Polling Unit staff must comply with this directive. According to him, \u201cThe extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters have had problems with accreditation. The Commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some Polling Units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem. \u201cThe Commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected Polling Unit shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the Commission. With this extension of time and the recommencement of accreditation where the BVAS consistently malfunctions, the Commission assures that no voter will be disenfranchised. \u201cOur deployment has also been adversely affected by transportation challenges in some locations. It must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilized and collected 50% of their sign on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded. Also, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. \u201cThe Commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case by case bases. Consequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the Commission. \u201cWe appeal to all voters, candidates, stakeholders communities and political parties to remain calm and law abiding. We assure you that the Commission is determined to make all votes count.\u201d, he stated.\n\n3:43PM\n\nAnambra Guber: INEC Extends Voting by One Hour Voting continues Sunday David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended voting in the Anambra governorship election.

          "text": "*INEC launches probe, extends accreditation, voting till today\n\n*To begin collation of results this morning\n\n*Hoodlums snatch ballot boxes in Onitsha, attack INEC officials in Ihiala\n\nNseobong Okon-Ekong, Chucks Okocha, Segun James and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nThe governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State, Prof. Charles Soludo; his counterpart in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Valentine Ozigbo; governorship candidate of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Dr. Obiora Okonkwo and the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, yesterday protested the widespread glitches that characterised the governorship election across the state.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has however disclosed that it was investigating the reason the accreditation devices \u2013 Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), did not work perfectly in some polling units.\n\nINEC, which also extended the period for opening and closing of the poll from 8.30 a.m. to 4 p.m., further reiterated that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the accreditation and voting for the affected polling units would continue today or at another time determined by the commission.\n\nThe electoral body also disclosed that the collation of results from local government areas will begin today by 10 a.m.\n\nResident Electoral Commissioner of INEC in Anambra State, Dr. Nkwachukwu Orji, who briefed journalists at the commission\u2019s headquarters yesterday afternoon, had explained that the extension of time arose out of several field reports that voters had problems with accreditation.\n\n\u201cThe commission is currently investigating the reason the accreditation devices, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), have worked perfectly in some polling units, but not in others. In some of the cases, it would seem that this resulted from software glitches. Our technicians have already built an update to the device software to prevent further challenges. The update is currently being installed in the concerned BVAS and we request voters, candidates, and agents to be patient and allow our technical staff to solve the problem.\n\n\u201cThe commission wishes to reiterate that in cases of sustained malfunction of the BVAS, the Presiding Officer must inform the voters and polling agents that accreditation and voting for the affected polling units shall continue tomorrow or at another time determined by the commission,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe explained that the commission faced transportation challenges in some locations.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that on account of security concerns, some of the transporters that were mobilised and collected 50 per cent of their sign-on fee backed out at the last moment, leaving some of our ad-hoc staff stranded. Also, some of the trained ad-hoc staff backed out at the last moment. The commission is on top of these challenges and extant regulations and guidelines will be applied on a case by case basis. Consequently, we are harvesting areas where voting will realistically no longer take place today, including places where substantial disruption has occurred, to enable a possible recommencement of voting at another time, in line with extant laws and the regulations and guidelines of the commission,\u201d Orji said.\n\nIn another press briefing held last night at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Awka, Orji said the commission was satisfied with the progress of the election, despite the earlier glitches posed by the BVAS machine.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m happy to report to you that the technical glitches we experienced with our BVAS were largely solved. We thank the voters and candidates for patiently waiting for the problem with the device to be resolved.\n\n\u201cThe report we got from our field officers and independent observers, convinced us that most voters were able to vote with the BVAS, following the extension of the voting period to 4 pm and our regulation that any voter on the queue at the time must be allowed to vote.\u201d\n\nOrji reiterated that the election would continue today in any polling unit where there was a consistent malfunction of the BVAS, and the voters in the unit were unable to vote.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to receive reports of any location where the sustained malfunction of the BVAS led to no election at all. Still, we shall continue to receive reports through our usual channels, particularly from the collation of the Form EC40G, which is the official document for recording polling units where elections did not hold or were cancelled,\u201d Orji said.\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe election is by no means over; we have now entered a critical stage of the process, namely collation of results. We have made adequate arrangements for the collation of results at the registration area, local government areas, and the state level.\n\n\u201cResults for polling units are already being uploaded in our IRev portal and registration area and the registration area collation has been progressing well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to announce that state collation will commence tomorrow (today) at the state collation centre. I invite those who are entitled to be present to come to witness it.\u201d\n\nDespite the initial threat of violence by separatist groups, the governorship election was held across the 21 local government areas under a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nHowever, in an isolated incident, hoodlums allegedly took away ballot boxes from two polling centres at the Immaculate Heart Catholic Church and the St. Faith Catholic Church in Fegge, Onitsha.\n\nThe assailants, numbering about six, stormed the St Faith Catholic Church by Mbonu Ejike/Basden Junction in an unmarked L300 bus.\n\nThey shot indiscriminately to scare the voters and security operatives.\n\nAnother set of gunmen stormed the polling unit at the Immaculate Heart Church along Zik\u2019s Avenue, also in Onitsha, snatching a ballot box.\n\nThe electoral commission also suspended the governorship election in Ihiala LGA of the state, following the outbreak of violence in various polling units in the area.\n\nINEC officials reported being attacked by hoodlums in different communities across the LGA.\n\nHoodlums reportedly disrupted the election and claimed they were enforcing the sit-at-home order earlier imposed by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), despite the fact that the sit-at-home directive had been suspended by IPOB before the election.\n\nThe widely reported failure of BVAS, according to the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, has\n\nrigged out over 70 per cent of the courageous voters who came out to be electronically captured to vote.\n\nA statement by the group signed by Emeka Umeagbalasi and Chidinma Udegbunam read in part,\n\n\u201cWe have gathered from many, if not most of the polling booths in the state and across the state\u2019s three senatorial districts, 326 wards and 5,720 polling centres that failure of the BVAS machines is widespread and has forced over 70 per cent of the voters not to be captured; thereby rubbishing the popularity and credibility of the entire exercise and paving way for the long rumoured rigging and preparation of the ground for declaration and imposition of an unpopular and unacceptable candidate as the next \u2018Anambra Governor-elect.\u2019\n\nThe group called on INEC to sack its ICT National Director and repeat the poll to give the same the credibility and popularity it deserves.\n\nIt also urged INEC to reverse this high-tech rigging and find alternatives to the massive failure of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System so that voters in the state can vote massively and conscientiously.\n\nThe group commended the Anambra voters who doggedly and courageously defied the security threats all over the state\u2019s political and electoral spaces to come out to vote the candidates of their choice only to be massively failed and disappointed by the commission.\n\nOn its part, the election monitoring group, Yiaga Africa, also criticised the deployment and non-functionality of BVAS, saying it had received reports of the BVAS failure to authenticate voters\u2019 fingerprints and photos even where voter\u2019s details were confirmed on the voter\u2019s register.\n\nMeanwhile, the candidate of the APC, Senator Andy Uba, has won his polling unit in the governorship election.\n\nINEC officials, who announced the results yesterday, said Uba had 80 votes in Ward 16, Polling Unit 17 in Uga, Aguata Local Government Area.\n\nSoludo scored 10 votes while the candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP), Senator Ifeanyi Uba, polled five votes.\n\nOzigbo of the PDP got two votes.\n\nSpeaking during a press interview when he arrived at his Uga Ward 1 to cast his vote at polling unit 17, the APC candidate commended INEC on the smooth conduct of the election.\n\nSoludo also won his Isuofia ward, Polling Unit 2 of Aguata LGA with 126 votes while Ozigbo and APC scored five and three votes, respectively.\n\nWhile YPP scored three votes, ZLP and LP got one vote each.\n\nOzigbo also scored 75 votes in his polling unit 010 Social Centre, Ward 005, of Aguata LGA, to beat his closest rival, Soludo, who got eight votes.\n\nAPC got two votes, while Labour Party and Accord Party got one vote each.\n\nHowever, the Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Nkem Okeke, who defected to the APC, lost his Umueze Awozu, Enugwu-Ukwu Ward 3, Polling Unit 005, to APGA.\n\nWhile APGA got 82 votes, APC scored 61 votes.\n\nPDP scored four votes; YPP, two votes; AAC, LP, and PRP scored one vote each.\n\nSoludo, Ozigbo, Ngige Kick over Malfunctioning of Machines\n\nSpeaking on the malfunction of the BVAS, the governorship candidate for APGA, Soludo stated that although he wants to be governor of Anambra State, he wants it to be done legitimately.\n\nSoludo, who voted after about five hours in his Ward in Aguata LGA, lamented that many people had not voted despite arriving at the polling unit early.\n\n\u201cIn my stronghold, the thing seems to have packed up literally as it were but again, as I said in the morning, I am a die-hard optimist and I want to believe that the system will deliver. If they are extending that till tomorrow, I am sure these people will be back here to vote; whenever they extend it to, these people will be back here because they want to vote and we want technology that enables all the eligible voters to vote. I want to be governor but I want to be elected legitimately with the votes of the people.\n\n\u201cEven if you put electricity here, at the rate at which the machine is going, maybe one person per hour, will be able to vote. I am not sure we will even finish by tomorrow. It is quite concerning, quite frankly, and what is happening in my polling booth here seems to represent largely the pool of the reports that I have got around the state. A few places, I understand, they said worked relatively well but in a vast majority of the places around the state, it just has not worked well. I understand that some people have now, over the last 30 minutes, in some few polling units randomly.\n\n\u201cI am in touch with them all although I have not left here since 11:30 am and I have to cast my vote but I will not jump the queue. I cannot jump the queue and be one of those privileged 20 that will be able to vote. No! These elderly people have been here since morning and they cannot get to vote. Several have left, I have seen hundreds of them walk away because they cannot sit here all day. So, I have just seen the release by the INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner talking about the extension; namely, that if we are here till 4 pm, you would still be allowed to cast your vote. That is fair enough, and there is also implicit in it, in my understanding, that there is a possibility of extending the voting time till tomorrow, possibly. I want to believe that this is one of those places that the voting time must be extended.\n\nOn his part, the governorship candidate of the PDP, Ozigbo, appealed to INEC to extend the duration of the exercise owing to reported glitches with the BVAS.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the peculiarities in the election; what that means is that if we need to extend the voting time, so we don\u2019t allow people who are eligible not to cast their vote, it would be unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m not only commenting on the situation, but I\u2019m also by this appealing to INEC and all the stakeholders to exercise patience and ensure the right people who have all the authentication cast their votes.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only way we can truly ensure that this election is by the people; by the greater Nigerians. We need more people to get their votes in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m by this appealing to the chairman of INEC that you reach out to your team in the various 21 local governments. Check where we have issues because right now there is no more instance form. There is nowhere to complain,\u201d Ozigbo explained.\n\nAlso speaking at his Alor Ward Polling Unit in the Idemili South Local Government Area, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Ngige urged INEC to resort to manual accreditation to allow people to exercise their franchise.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been here for over an hour without success. I\u2019m not impressed.\u201d\n\nNgige said, \u201cThat the machines are failing is understandable, and we all know that it is a human-machine, so it is prone to such malfunctioning.\n\n\u201cHowever, I think that the INEC would have put the BVAS machine to a mock election in another state before bringing it to Anambra to ensure that it works efficiently. I also suggest that the machines should not be dumped after this election, else by 2023 when we go for the general election, it would still be the same case.\u201d\n\nAlso, the governorship candidate of ZLP, Okonkwo said poor functioning of the machines and the late commencement of polls would adversely affect the process.\n\nOkonkwo, who voted at his polling unit, Ogidi Town Hall, Polling Unit 009, Ogidi Ward 2, said many voters would be disenfranchised due to the poor functioning of the machines.\n\nThe member representing Anaocha, Njikoka, and Dunukofia in the Federal House of Representatives,\n\nHon. Dozie Nwankwo accused INEC of what he termed systematic rigging, following the failure of the BVAS machines at his ward, Enuagu Enugwu Ukwu Ward One, Units 003 and 004. The ward has two polling centres and 1,466 registered voters but only 23 voters had been able to vote as of 11:50 a.m.\n\nApart from the malfunctioning of the machines, the election was also characterised by a poor turnout of voters at the initial stages.\n\nAt Polling Unit in No.04 07 02 002 located at Community Primary School in Amawbia in Awka, elderly people were allowed to do accreditation and later voted for the candidates of their choice.\n\nAt the Agu Awka Ward 2, (Aroma Junction) as at 11 a.m., voting had not started due to poor internet network.\n\nAt the Obinagu. Ward 04 in Awka south, votes buying was observed. Some political parties were offering between N7,000 to N10,000.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Journalist and writer, Dele Momodu says the late Femi Osibona, owner of Fourscore Homes and developer of the 21-storey building that collapsed in Lagos, was a cousin of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nOn Monday, the building located on Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos collapsed, killing over 40 people, including Osibona.\n\nIn an opinion article titled, \u2018The Unsolvable Jigsaw of the Ikoyi Tragedy\u2019, Momodu said the deceased was an ambitious man and not the \u201cgreedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is\u201d.\n\nHe added that Osibona despite being a cousin of Vice President Osibanjo never sought or got any government contracts.\n\n\u201cI had known Femi for over 20 years in London as an extremely gifted marketer. Femi\u2019s tongue was honey-coated, and it was impossible not to like him,\u201d Momodu said.\n\n\u201cWe lost touch after I ended exile and returned to Africa, but he soon traced me to Ghana, and he came visiting. He was so happy to reunite with me. He told me how God had blessed him mightily and had made him veer into real estate in London. Femi was a genius who made stupendous gains from regenerating ghetto neighbourhoods in East London. He regaled me with tales of his exploits in the property business.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Vice President Osinbajo Linked To Lagos Collapsed Building With Current Death Toll Of 36 Persons\n\n\u201cHe promised to build the classiest residential apartments in Africa. He said he was out to prove there was nothing the multinational construction companies were doing that his company can\u2019t do. I have never seen such a level of audacity, determination and tenacity. Fourscore was a visionary and a missionary when it came to seeking to excel and do as well as his international counterparts at home and abroad. He had competed in their space, in their countries before, with moderate successes and did not see any reason why he could not replicate the same and attain loftier heights in his home country.\n\n\u201cIf he made any mistakes, it was probably that he overstretched himself, but he was such an ambitious man, full of faith. And certainly not the greedy avaricious person that his traducers now suggest he is. In our country, mistakes are never excused, forgiven or forgotten. When you fail, you\u2019re a villain and outcast. When you succeed, you\u2019re a hero, genius and superstar.\"\n\nMomodu said the inquest and investigation ordered into the incident should be done diligently\n\n\u201cIt must be painstaking and thorough. Such investigations cannot last thirty days as being directed by the government; I foresee that any credible inquiry must take months of arduous diligent work. Various possibilities including negligence, sabotage and even natural or human causes such as the over-dredging occurring in that vicinity must be considered. Dead men tell no tales. They cannot defend themselves, but records and logic abound,\u201d he added.\n\nSee Also News Vice President Osinbajo Threatens Lawsuit Over Report Linking Him With Collapsed Ikoyi Building, Claims Without Evidence SaharaReporters Was Paid To Publish Report\n\n\u201cThose making claims and allegations which are easily rumpled will soon be exposed. I\u2019d known that In February 2020 the third block was at the beginning of the foundation stage and the other two blocks were merely a few storeys gone. It is interesting that nobody who had any misgivings reported such to the Regulators. I say no more, other than that it is always convenient to cast aspersions when it seems there is no potential for the reply.\n\n\u201cWhat I know is Fourscore was a self-made man who depended on no godfather. Despite being a cousin of the vice-president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, he was too proud and self-reliant to approach the vice-president or anybody else for favours of that kind. He never sought for or got any government contracts. He relied on his own ability, marketing skills and funds.\u201d",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience. Within the same period, the local unit grew its profit after tax by 53% to \u20a6220 billion ($385 million).\n\n\u201cMTN Nigeria remains an important part of the Group and its fundamentals remain solid,\u201d Omole said, adding that the share sale \u201cgives local retail and institutional investors an opportunity to tap into MTN Nigeria\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nAs part of its ARP, MTN Group is in the process of finalising a sale-and-leaseback of its South African telecom mast portfolio as well as list shares in the Uganda operation in Kampala.\n\nThe company recently raked in some proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of telecom infrastructure company, IHS Towers, in New York last month.\n\nShare this article",

Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value.

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020.

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

          "title": "40m unbanked Nigerians to benefit from MTN, Airtel mobile money licenses",
          "text": "Estimated at over 40 million, Nigeria\u2019s unbanked adult population who are mostly in the hard-to-reach rural communities are expected to have access to financial services, thanks to the awaiting mobile money licence for MTN and Airtel.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) last Thursday issued MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa Approval-in-Principle (AIP) for payment service bank (PSB) licence.\n\nAlthough it is the first step in the process towards final approval, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions as stipulated by the CBN, the move by the industry regulator shows that mobile money takeoff in Nigeria is just around the corner.\n\n\u201cWith this move by CBN, it is more likely that we are going to meet some of the financial inclusion targets,\u201d Ashley Immanuel, CEO of EFInA, the organisation that collates Nigeria\u2019s biennial financial inclusion data, says.\n\nThis, according to Immanuel, is based on the evidence that has been witnessed in countries that have leveraged the mobile money-led financial inclusion model to onboard the majority of their unbanked population.\n\nLargely driven by mobile technology, Kenya\u2019s financial inclusion expanded from a low base of 26.7 percent a decade ago to 83 percent in 2020. The East African country is one of the world\u2019s leaders in mobile money services. Telecom\u2019s operator Safaricom pioneered its M-Pesa service 12 years ago to cater for Kenyans without access to the formal banking network.\n\nThe success story of mobile money in deepening financial inclusion is also evident in countries like Ghana, Ethiopia and others.\n\nWhile Nigeria went late to the party as the Central Bank only gave an official nod to telecoms and other non-financial companies to offer financial services in 2018, the payment service bank by the regulator would enable players to offer financial services while deepening the country\u2019s financial inclusion rate.\n\nThe permit will allow the companies to among other things, maintain savings accounts and accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, which is covered by the deposit insurance scheme; carry out payments and remittance (including cross-border personal remittance) services through various channels within Nigeria; issue debit and prepaid cards, and operate an electronic purse or wallet.\n\nThe Central Bank gave its first set of licences to three players in August 2020, two years after it received applications.\n\nBefore now, only banks and licensed financial institutions were allowed to provide financial services (bank-led financial inclusion model). Although telecom operators and other fintech companies indicated interest to operate in the market, the CBN policy would not allow them.\n\nThe regulator eventually shifted because of the increasing rate of financially excluded Nigerians and the lack of progress in getting banks to provide financial services to people living in areas that lack access.\n\nAlmost a decade ago, the apex bank set a target to ensure that 80 percent of the country\u2019s adult population was financially included in the financial cycle by 2020. The CBN had in a circular in July 2018, lamented that Nigeria was not meeting any of the financial inclusion targets agreed and contained in the 2012 Financial Inclusion Strategy.\n\nNigeria failed to meet its National Financial Inclusion Strategy target for 2020 to include 80 percent of its adult population into the financial system. EFInA data show that only 64.1 percent was financially included by the end of last year.\n\nThis means that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38.1 million of the country\u2019s 106 million (18 years and above) adults, remain completely financially excluded. This is a shortfall by 16 percent points from the desired target of a 20 percent exclusion rate.\n\nThe 2012 strategy by the CBN had also aimed to reach 70 percent of Nigerians with formal financial services by 2020; the actual figure reported by the EFInA\u2019s Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey released last Thursday showed it was 51 percent \u2013 a shortfall by 19 percent points.\n\nRead Also: AfDB, YDFS signs $500,000 grant agreement to deepen financial inclusion of women in Nigeria\n\nFinancial inclusion means that people have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit and insurance. A higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population, as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\nA higher financial exclusion rate in Nigeria could lead to a poorer population as lack of access to credit and insurance puts them at an economic disadvantage.\n\n\u201cWe have said that the biggest thing the CBN could do to quickly expand financial access to people who are not in the system at all is to increase mobile money services, which in Nigeria will be under the PSB licence and to license entities that are capable at reaching customers at scale,\u201d Immanuel says.\n\nAccording to research analysts at FBNQuest, the unrivalled reach of GSM network operators across Nigeria, and with MTN covering over 90 percent of the nation\u2019s population, will help increase financial access.\n\nCommenting on the recently issued Approval in Principle, MTN Nigeria said, the decision to issue a final approval is firmly within the regulatory purview of the CBN and it respects their right and judgment in that regard.\n\nWith its presence in 14 countries across Africa, Airtel Africa, a provider of telecommunications and mobile money services said its subsidiary SMARTCASH Payment Service Bank Limited (\u201cSmartcash\u201d) had been granted approval in principle to operate a payment service bank business in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Segun Ogunsanya, CEO, Airtel Africa, the telecom company \u201cwill now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the operating licence and commence operations.\u201d\n\nWhy mobile money is a catalyst for financial inclusion growth\n\nThe use of the mobile money-led financial inclusion model has been adopted by many countries that previously suffered high financial exclusion rates because it is one of the easiest ways to include the hard-to-reach unbanked population into the formal financial system.\n\nIn the case of Kenya, Ghana and many other African countries, with the use of mobile phone numbers used in place of a bank account, citizens of the countries are allowed to carry out financial transactions like payment, savings, credit, insurance, and among others.\n\nThe same is expected to happen in Nigeria through the PSB licence. The innovation will remove some of the barriers to having a basic bank account like documentation in obtaining a Bank Verification Number (BVN), an 11-digit number that is created for bank customers before they are assigned a bank account, proximity to financial services provider, among others.\n\nWith just a phone number, any Nigerian who does not have a bank account will most likely be able to ride on the infrastructure of any of the telco or other service providers to transact through an e-wallet or mobile money account.\n\n\u201cGiven the unrivalled reach of GSM network operators across the country, with MTN covering over 90 percent of the nation\u2019s population, its active engagement in the mobile money space will help increase financial access,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest say.",
          "summary": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) last Thursday issued MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa Approval-in-Principle (AIP) for payment service bank (PSB) licence.\nLargely driven by mobile technology, Kenya\u2019s financial inclusion expanded from a low base of 26.7 percent a decade ago to 83 percent in 2020.\nThe East African country is one of the world\u2019s leaders in mobile money services.\nThe success story of mobile money in deepening financial inclusion is also evident in countries like Ghana, Ethiopia and others.\nBefore now, only banks and licensed financial institutions were allowed to provide financial services (bank-led financial inclusion model).",

          "text": "If there is anybody to speak on how Nigerian universities are no longer scared, it is Aliyu Shugaba, a professor and vice-chancellor, University of Maiduguri, Borno State, which is the flashpoint of Boko Haram insurgent attacks and epicenter of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nPainting a picture of the sad developments that have made the Ivory Tower less glamorous for ambitious lecturers, insecure for budding students and less fun for families on campus, Professor Shugaba says, the fact that some of the university facilities were destroyed by bombings and gunshots was devastating.\n\n\u201cSometimes, when the bombs went off, the blasts affected the psychology of our students, making them live in fear. Some of the bombings took place late in the night or early in the morning and this affected the optimal output of the staff and students,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite the bombings and kidnappings of students and lecturers, especially along the Maiduguri-Damaturu highway, the vice chancellor says, \u201cAt some point we made a resolve that we would live with it and continue to discharge our responsibility of teaching, research and community service.\u201d\n\nSo also, other universities across the country resolved to keep on despite the growing insecurity, considering the fact that the government has done little or nothing to curb the attacks on universities, on education and on the future of the country.\n\nToday, university campuses are no longer safe as kidnappers and gunmen have brazen up and are now invading campus to take hostage of lecturers and students unlike the former method of waiting for them outside the campus or on the highways close to the campuses.\n\nThe cases are rising on a daily basis and regrettably unabated. This year alone, over 50 lecturers and university students have been kidnapped by gunmen with at least three deaths across the country.\n\nIn May this year, the Taraba state police command confirmed the kidnapping of Umar Buba, a lecturer and head of the Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, Faculty of Agriculture in Taraba State University by some armed men. In the same May, there were a series of attacks on University of Jos that warranted the management to close all its students\u2019 hostels over security threats to the school.\n\nRead Also: METKA delivers off-grid hybrid power project to second Nigerian university\n\nNigerian University\n\nIn June this year, one Dan Ella, a lecturer in the Department of Theatre Art, University of Jos, was abducted amid a ransom of N10 million for his release.\n\nIn August, two lecturers at Abia State University, Uturu and others were robbed and kidnapped by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen along ABSU-Isuikwuato Road, though they were later released and one of the lecturers was said to have died from the beatings received from the kidnappers.\n\nThere was also a report of the kidnap of Professor John Alabi, dean of the Faculty of Management Sciences at Kogi State University, Ayingba, by unknown gunmen when the lecturer was about to enter his apartment.\n\nMost recently, gunmen invaded University of Abuja staff quarters in Gwagwalada and abducted six persons including four professors. Reports have it that they have been rescued by security agents.\n\nAlthough in many of the cases, most of the abducted lecturers, their family members and students have regained freedom, probably after ransom is paid, the spate of the attacks on Nigerian campuses is alarming.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, Anele Oguezi, an associate professor at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State, decried that no place is safe if gunmen can attack the Nigerian Defense Academy in Kaduna unchallenged.\n\n\u201cGovernment keeps saying Boko Haram is technically defeated, that bandits are being taken care of, yet these felons keep taking more hostages every day, making money from it and denying many the opportunity to go to school,\u201d he decried.\n\nSpeaking further, the aggrieved lecturer, who has lost five students to foreign universities due to the growing insecurity in Ebonyi State, lamented that the government\u2019s weakness in addressing the situation is giving the culprits energy to do more.\n\nBut Onyedi Ifeatu, a senior lecturer at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, thinks that the university community should secure itself as kidnapping has become a lucrative business jointly perpetrated by hoodlums and some unscrupulous security operatives.\n\n\u201cI will not be surprised that some students will be considering going into kidnapping after graduation because there is no job anywhere; kidnapping is paying good money and kidnappers seem to enjoy protection from some unscrupulous security agents,\u201d Ifeatu said.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cImagine making N5 million from ransom in a month, then kidnapping more people and doubling that amount in two months, what business or job will pay you such an amount? Kidnapping is now lucrative and that is why it is thriving, with even security agents joining.\u201d\n\nAli Nuhu, a father of a University of Jos student who was kidnapped and later released, decried that the government has failed in its security responsibility as families are left to bear the burden of paying ransom for the release of their kidnapped loved ones or bear the loss alone, in the case of death or declared missing for a long time.\n\nNuhu, a pharmacist, said the government can curb the security challenge if it wants to, but shying away because of certain interests, which is killing the country today. Our security is bigger than any person, religion or tribe. Deal with bandits, kidnapper and Boko Haram with full federal might and they will disappear. Government can, but it will not until we all die because their children are all overseas. It is a shame,\u201d he said.\n\nThe pharmacist, who studied on scholarship, decried that already the number of out-of-schools is growing in Nigeria and the attacks on campuses would compound the situation, forcing more students, whose parents cannot send abroad, to be at home instead of being kidnapped or killed on campus by gunmen.\n\nApart from Boko Haram insurgency, increased attacks on local farmers, killings and kidnapping by suspected Fulani herdsmen marauding as bandits have become the order of the day.\n\nThese herdsmen have terrorised Nigerians, destroyed properties and communities, maimed, kidnapped for ransom, while leaving tails of anguish on the lips of many Nigerians.\n\nA recent report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and European Union (EU) said no fewer than 2,295 teachers have lost their lives, while 1,400 schools have been destroyed in North-East Nigeria since 2009 as a result of insurgency.\n\nPolitical leaders have blamed armed groups for carrying out the series of kidnapping for ransom and raids on schools and universities in Northern Nigeria in recent times.\n\nObservers say that such an attack on a university in Abuja, the seat of power, was a glaring sign that Nigeria is unsafe for the masses and that the situation had worsened with no hope in sight.\n\nPublic affairs analyst, Kayode Kehinde, however, blamed government at all levels for not doing enough to address the situation, stressing that the unemployment rates, corruption among the leaders in the armed forces had contributed.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI mean more emphasis has been put on the Northern regions of Nigeria, inter-state travels, and rising levels of insecurity in some other parts. But right again, abduction at the central capital territory and even in the University environment diminishes all hopes that some parts of the country are still safe.\n\n\u201cWe cannot overemphasise how the insecurity issues in Nigeria keep deteriorating as the day goes by. And if you ask why; to get a better answer, we must also consider the major root causes of increasing crimes in societies.\n\n\u201cWhen governments do not fulfil their promises to the people, when we have increasing unemployment, corruption in the military, and including other forces who are supposed to be the protectors of the lives and property of people, but are now terrors, when we have groups of selfish leaders who know the right things to do but for their personal gains abandon them, etc, the result would always be an insecure society.\u201d\n\nKehinde further advised the Federal Government to redouble its effort to check the spate of insecurity across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBefore the issue further degenerates, it is high time the government sat tight to its responsibilities. As I often say, the best definition of a failed state is one that fails to protect the lives and property of its people.\n\n\u201cWe must act right to get positive results, and the government should stop solving problems from its surface lining but from its actual root,\u201d Kehinde added.\n\nA father of four who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the incident at UNIABUJA had devastated him, making him to almost lose hope in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn July this year, I was discussing with a group of people that Abuja remained the only place where students can now study peacefully. I had said that it would be difficult for the bandits terrorising Niger, Kaduna, Zamfara, and some other states, to venture into Abuja. In fact, I also said that parents should start encouraging their children to apply for admission in the private and public universities in Abuja for security reasons; but I have been proven wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nThe retired federal director-general advised the government to do everything within its power to restore confidence in the citizens, saying \u201cThe primary role of every government is protection of lives and property. If bandits should take over the Federal Capital Territory, it signifies the failure of any government.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAbuja \u2013 In a week of Climate Change Summit in Glasgow, Scotland in the United Kingdom, President Muhammadu Buhari also used the opportunity to voice his deep-rooted desires to boost Nigeria\u2019s National Infrastructure Stock.\n\nBuhari made his feelings known in Glasgow at the COP26 high-level side event on improving global infrastructure hosted by President Joe Biden of the United States, EU Commission President, Von Der Leyen, and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on Nov. 2.\n\nAccording to Nigerian leader, over 1.5 trillion dollars is needed by Nigeria over a 10-year period, to achieve an appreciable level of the National Infrastructure Stock.\n\nBuhari, who had earlier delivered his national statement at COP26 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, on Tuesday, said:\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration has established a clear legal and regulatory framework for private financing of infrastructure to establish a standard process, especially on the monitoring and evaluation process.\n\n\u2018\u2018We look forward to working with you in this regard.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also declared that his administration had taken infrastructure expansion in Nigeria seriously, conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is a nexus between infrastructure development and the overall economic development of a nation.\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration identified this early enough as a major enabler of sustainable economic development and the realisation of other continental and global development aspirations particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\u2018\u2018On my assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria faced a huge infrastructure deficit and the total National Infrastructure Stock was estimated at 35% of our Gross Domestic Product.\u201d\n\nWhile delivering his national statement to world leaders, the President pledged that Nigeria would cut its emissions to net zero by 2060.\n\nHe said that attaining national and global climate change goals would require adequate and sustained technical and financial support to developing countries.\n\nAccording to him, greater effort should be channelled towards assisting developing nations to meet their \u2018\u2018Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) commitments through the pledges made by the developed countries to provide at least $100 billion yearly.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari noted that easier access to climate finance had become imperative in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, which really battered the economies of developing countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018I do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Desertification in the North, floods in the centre, pollution and erosion on the coast are enough evidence.\n\n\u2018\u2018For Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today.\n\n\u201dNigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president had on Nov. 1 at an event, co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron, the Prince of Wales, and the Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, maintained that \u201dAfrica\u2019s ambition of restoring over 100 million hectares of degraded landscape for productive agriculture is achievable\u201d.\n\nThe president expressed optimism at the Climate Change Summit, COP26, side event on the Great Green Wall (GGW).\n\nThe Nigerian leader said it was noteworthy that the meeting was tailored towards ameliorating the problems of land degradation, desertification, depletion of the forest ecosystems and biodiversity in Africa.\n\nThe president, who was speaking on the theme of the event, \u201cAccelerating land restoration in Africa, the case of the Great Green Wall initiative\u201d, said:\n\n\u2018\u2018With all hands on deck and concerted efforts at land restoration by African leaders, I am optimistic that Africa\u2019s ambition of restoring over 100 million hectares of degraded landscape for productive agriculture is achievable.\n\n\u2018\u2018Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to inform you that Nigeria will soon be assuming the leadership of Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Pan African Agency of the Great Green Wall.\u201d\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that American billionaire and founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, had also on Nov. 1 in Glasgow, Scotland, commended Buhari\u2019s leadership role in restoring degraded lands in the country.\n\nBezos described the commitment of the Nigerian leader to restore 4 million hectares as exemplary.\n\nBezos joined Buhari, French President Emmanuel Macron, Prince Charles and the Mauritanian President, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, at a COP26 side event entitled, \u201cAccelerating land restoration in Africa, the case of the Great Green Wall (GGW) initiative\u201d.\n\nWhile heaping praises on the Nigerian leader at the event co-hosted by the French President, his Mauritanian counterpart and the Prince of Wales, the Amazon founder said: \u201cWe are fortunate to have President Buhari of Nigeria with us today.\n\n\u201cNigeria plays a critical role in the restoration movement and has pledged to restore 4 million hectares of degraded lands.\n\n\u201cThis kind of ambition coming from Africa\u2019s largest economy underscores just how vital this issue is.\u201d\n\nThe Bezos Earth Fund has 10 billion dollars to allocate money to projects fighting climate change.\n\nBefore departing for the COP26 in Glasgow, Buhari had commiserated with families who lost loved ones in the 21-storey building collapse in Lagos.\n\nBuhari shared the sad moment with people and Government of Lagos State, calling on

Congress (APC), Sen. Bola Tinubu, at his official residence, State House, Abuja, on Oct. 31.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents after the closed door meeting, Tinubu dismissed the insinuation that he was in the presidential villa to discuss politics with the president.\n\nHe, however, stated that his Sunday\u2019s mission to the seat of power was to thank Buhari for visiting him when he was recovering from a surgery at his residence in London.\n\nHe said: \u201dI came only to thank, first of all, the president for his visit to my residence in London when I was \u2026\u2026after the surgery, and wishing me well, lifting my spirit.\n\n\u201dIndeed, what an exceptional leader will do.\n\n\u201dThat\u2019s what I came for and to welcome him back from the trip from Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201dNo politics, just courtesy call, thanking him in a big way, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nThe president had on Aug. 13 visited the APC chieftain in London.\n\nNAN reports that the president also received briefing from the Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo, at the Presidential Villa on Sunday.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Buhari had expressed deep shock and grief over the killing of 69 people in Niger Republic by insurgents on the country\u2019s common border with Mali and Burkina Fasso.\n\nHe said: \u201dThis dastardly and callous attack on innocent people, including a mayor in Niger Republic, is a disturbing setback to the regional efforts to stem terrorist activities that have caused massive destructions in our countries.\u201d\n\nThe president on Nov. 6 also condoled with the government and people of Sierra Leone, following the fuel tanker explosion in Freetown, the country\u2019s capital, where at least 100 people were killed and many injured.\n\nThe tragic incident happened late on Friday when a fuel tanker exploded following a collision, and many people rushed to the scene to siphon petrol.\n\nThe Nigerian leader said: \u201dI\u2019m anguished by the unfortunate loss of lives and injury to so many.\u201d\n\nNAN also reports that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo had on Nov. 7 attended the meeting of the Nigeria-Cote d\u2019Ivoire Binational Commission where he signed agreements with Ivorian Prime Minister, Patrick Achi.\n\nThe signing of agreements was at the high level segment of the Second Session of the Nigeria-Cote d\u2019Ivoire Bi-National Commission on Saturday in Abidjan, Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nOsinbajo thanked Achi for his excellent leadership in hosting and co-steering the 2nd session of the Nigeria-Cote d\u2019Ivoire Bi-National Commission to a successful outcome.\n\nHe said that Achi\u2019s opening remarks were certainly very important for setting the tone and ensuring that objectives of the meeting were achieved.\n\nThe vice president also expressed gratitude to President Alhassane Ouattara for granting him and his delegation audience earlier and for giving both sides very wise and insightful guidance on how to deepen relations between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian delegation on its part is quite happy with the outcomes especially the Agreements that we have signed on this occasion,\u201d he added.\n\nNAN reports that Buhari will this week pay an official visit to Paris, France, to reciprocate an earlier one to Nigeria by the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and also attend the Paris Peace Forum 2021.\n\nThe Paris Peace Forum will be the fourth edition to be hosted by the French President.\n\n\u201dIt will have Heads of State and Government and CEOs of major multinationals as well as several civil society actors, gathering to advance concrete solutions to the enormous challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and to improve global governance in times of COVID-19.\n\n\u201dThe Summit will focus on spurring a more solid and inclusive recovery by addressing the various gaps in global governance, offering initiatives to better tend to the global commons and putting forward new principles of action for the post-COVID world,\u201d the president\u2019s media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, had said in a statement.\n\nHe revealed that while the president is in Paris, the Nigerian government would organise the Nigeria-Paris Forum.\n\nAccording to him, the event is expected to pull a crowd of Nigerian and French investors, government and business leaders, diplomats and the media in the hope of showcasing opportunities on both sides.\n\nShehu expressed optimism that the event would also bring enlightenment to bear on the prevailing security, economic and investment climate in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the presidential aide, Buhari is expected back in the country after the engagements.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nJos \u2013 Security of lives and property has significantly improved in some parts of the North-Central and Taraba with the residents now conducting their activities in a relatively peaceful atmosphere, a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) survey has revealed.\n\nPart of the survey was conducted in Nasarawa, Plateau and Taraba, among other states, and it found that travelers and other road users in the zone were now moving around with less fear, courtesy of the improvement of the security situation there.\n\nIn Nasarawa State, to begin with, Salihu Adamu, Chairman, National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Nasarawa State branch, told NAN that there was a decline in the attack on his members when compared with the second and third quarter of the year.\n\n\u201cThe security situation on our roads is improving. Before now, in a week, I used to receive reports of two to three attacks by armed robbers and kidnappers. I have not received report of any attack in recent times,\u201d Adamu said.\n\nHe said that there had been an increase in passenger traffic in most of the parks in the state because of the improvement of the security situation in the state, and prayed for its sustenance.\n\nHe commended security agencies for \u201cdealing decisively with the criminal elements on our high ways\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Peter Ahemba, who was at the New Park, Lafia to board a vehicle to Akwanga, noted that kidnapping, robbery and other forms of attacks on Lafia \u2013 Akwanga road had reduced when compared to the early part of the year.\n\nAhemba attributed the reduction of insecurity in Nasarawa state roads to the onslaught against criminal elements and constant surveillance by security agencies.\n\nHe commended the government and security agencies for their efforts, but appealed for sustenance of the gesture by way of stepping up efforts to curtail the activities of marauders in the high ways.\n\nIn Taraba also, residents of the state affirmed the reduction in armed robbery, kidnappings and other forms of insecurity on the roads within the state when compared to the beginning of the year.\n\nThey told NAN in Jalingo that many routes in the state such as Wukari- Takum and Danacha- Bornu Kurukuru which were impassable at the beginning of the year due to armed robbery and kidnapping were now safe for motorists.\n\nOne of them, Alhaji Abdullahi Suleiman, a businessman, said he could now pass through some routes that were considered \u201cdanger areas\u201d at the beginning of the year.\n\n\u201cAs a businessman who moves round the state, the last few years through to the beginning of 2021 were terrible for me as a lot of routes in the state were impassable due to armed robbery, kidnappings and communal crisis.\n\n\u201cThank God there is noticeable reduction at the moment because I personally pass through such routes like Takum- Chanchaji- Wukari, Mutum Biyu \u2013 Garba Chede roads among others for businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Helen Matsonde, a resident of Jalingo, also noted that the rate of insecurity on the roads in the state had significantly reduced.\n\nAccording to Matsonde, almost all roads in the state were not safe both during the day and in the night at the beginning of year 2021 with daily reports of armed robberies and kidnappings.\n\nAlhaji Sani Hamamgabdo, the Taraba Chairman, National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), also confirmed that the roads in the state were safer now compared to the beginning of the year.\n\nHamamgabdo also said that there was a gradual increase in passenger traffic at the parks as the Christmas and New Year celebrations period drew nearer\n\nSimilarly, an official of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW),Farin Gada Motor Park, Jos,Plateau, said security on the Jengre, Saminaka and Zaria road had improved.\n\nHe attributed the improvement to the inclusion of neighbourhood watch and vigilante in the patrol of highways in the area.\n\nHe said kidnapping which used to happen almost on a daily basis on that route was now a thing of the past.\n\nHe, however, advised the government to allow civil security outfits to take part in highway patrol to reduce attacks on the nation\u2019s roads.\n\nSome drivers spoken to also said that security on the highways within and outside the state had improved.\n\nOne of them is Sani Mohammed, who operates at the Plateau state motor park.\n\nHe told NAN that security on the Yobe-Maiduguri highway had improved in the last months.\n\nMohammed, who plies the Yobe-Maiduguri road through Jos, attributed the improvement to more presence of security personnel on the highway.\n\n\u201cSecurity on the Yobe, Maiduguri highway has improved in the last months and we are very grateful for that.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the Boko Haram insurgents would come out to attack people on the highway on a daily basis, sometimes three times in a day.\n\n\u201cIt has reduced drastically in the last three months.There are more security men on the highway who are on patrol all through the day, this is the reason for the reduction of the attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Joe Etuk, a luxurious bus driver, who drives to Lagos and Ibadan from Jos, also said the security on the highway had improved of recent.\n\nEtuk,however, decried the poor state of the the roads, which he said, was causing road traffic crashes.\n\nIn Niger, however, the State branch of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), said the security situation in the state had worsened with residents and drivers of the association afraid to travel to certain parts of the state.\n\nAlhaji Idris Adamu, the State Secretary of NURTW, who disclosed this said the association had recorded decrease in the number of passengers that traveled because of consistent kidnapping of travellers by bandits on the major roads of the state.\n\nAdamu said that at the beginning of the year, many passengers and drivers were traveling without fear, but that the situation had now changed as many people were afraid to travel due to fear of being kidnapped.\n\nHe said that the situation was now worst compared to the beginning of the year as passengers and drivers were being kidnapped on daily basis.\n\n\u201cBefore now, we only had one or two cases of kidnapping, only few of our members were being whisked away by these hoodlums, but recently, we have had many cases of attacks on commercial vehicles.\n\n\u201cThis experience scares many people from traveling, especially to axis like Zungeru, Kontagora, Kagara, Rafi, Mashegu, Mariga, Wushishi, Babana, Rijaw Nasko that are volatile.\n\n\u201cThere is a decrease in the number of persons that travel now, except during festive periods like Christmas and Sallah where large number of people travels,\u201d he said.\n\nThe secretary said that some of the kidnapped passengers and drivers were rescued, some escaped, some paid ransom before they were released, while some died in captivity.\n\nHe noted that attacks by bandits on the roads had increased of recent as a result of the ongoing security operations in neighbouring states of Zamfara, Kaduna and Kastina, which forced most of the bandits to flee to Niger.\n\nHe, however, said that the association was working with security agencies to station personnel across motor parks as part of measures to protect passengers and drivers.\n\nIn Lokoja, some road transport workers and commuters appealed to the government to intensify efforts at ensuring that the roads were safe for travellers by increasing the level of security patrol.\n\nThey told NAN that the security situation on Federal and State roads across Kogi had yet to improve to an appreciable level.\n\nBut Long distance drivers and National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) from the major motor parks in Lokoja commended the state government for its efforts at making the roads safe with the support of security agencies.\n\nThey, however, said that kidnapping and robbery on the roads had yet to reduce to appreciable level as pockets of criminal activities were being reported daily and could increase with the approaching yuletide.\n\nAccording to Mr Ajoro Monday, Vice Chairman, Kogi Travellers Bus park at Cemetery, Lokoja, intra-state roads were safer now compared to the rampant cases of robbery and kidnapping recorded before this year.\n\nMonday, however, lamented that kidnappings on Okene-Okpella, Okene-Ibilo and Okene-Adogo-Ajaokuta roads had yet to abate as cases of hostage taking of travellers on the highways had remained a recurring decima, almost on daily basis.\n\nHe said that Itobe-Anyigba as well as Idah-Ejule-Anyigba roads which were notorious for criminal activities in the early parts of the year now enjoyed relative peace with an on-and-off reports of hoodlum activities.\n\nAbdulsalam Abubakar, the Secretary of the Ganaja Junction, Lokongoma NURTW Park, said kidnapping was no longer rampant as it used to be but \u201cit is definitely not over and one cannot relax because it is difficult to predict them.\n\n\u201cBetween June and October, they kidnapped about four of our drivers between Otukpa Branch and Ochadamu road and they are still operating. They can take anybody unawares.\n\n\u201cGovernment should intensify more effort in ensuring that the roads are safe for travellers by increasing the level of patrol by security agencies,\u201d he implored.\n\nAccording to Mr Nathaniel Abaniwo, a Human Rights activist and Executive Director, Rehoboth Community Advancement Initiative (RECAN), the roads are not all that safe now.\n\nAbaniwo said that travellers only had the option of prayers when the journey was too important to skip, adding, \u201cyou need to pray and ask God to take care so that you will go and come back safely. We are just hoping on God as the Chief Security of everyone.\n\n\u201cWe are having more cases now because it is like the kidnappers who went into hiding before are now back on the roads and it is not only the roads now, they are going into people\u2019s homes to pick them.\n\n\u201cThe government has to step up the game. Yes, our governor is really doing well in the area of security but I think this is the right time to do more as we are gradually going into the festive period,\u201d he said.\n\nObabolu Obahopo, a journalist at the Mega Terminal, Lokoja, said the security arrangements were more effective in the night than in the day.\n\nObahopo said that all the state roads were very safe in the night than during the day, adding that the hoodlums now took advantage of that to carry out their heinous activities in the day.\n\nMr Emmanuel Abdullahi, a commercial vehicle driver, said the security situation was deteriorating more as \u201cwe now have more cases of robbery and kidnapping\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe pray government finds solution to this problem by deploying more security personnel to the roads to solve this problem for us to have peace and ease of commutting on our roads,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nMeanwhile, passengers at some motor parks in Makurdi, the Benue capital, have decried the rising cases of insecurity on roads in the state of recent.\n\nOne of them,Mr Iorwashima Kulenkwagh, who spoke with NAN at Yaman Park, said that most of the roads in the state were not safe as early as 8 p.m.\n\n\u201cStrong men do take charge of most of the Benue roads as from 8 p.m.,\u201d Kulenkwagh said.\n\nChiangi Aluna, also a passenger in the Makurdi Local Government Area main motor park, agreed with Kulenkwagh that because of insecurity on most of the Benue roads, passengers no longer made night trips.\n\n\u201cThe situation is worse on Makurdi-Aliade road.\n\n\u201cVehicles coming from the South usually sleep in Aliade town and some even sleep in Otukpo until the following day before they continue with their journey.\n\n\u201cSame thing applies to vehicles going to the South from the North. They usually sleep in Makurdi once it is 8 p.m.,\u201d Aluna said.\n\nAt New Nyanya park, Mrs Vera Odeh, a passenger said that she plied the Makurdi-Lafia road at least once in a week,but that she did not travel in the night because of insecurity.\n\n\u201cJust last week, to be precise on Thursday, my husband\u2019s brother was coming to Makurdi from Abuja in the night and was attacked by armed robbers at Yelwata.\n\n\u201cThey dispossessed him of all his belongings including his clothes. The road is not safe during the night,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Terngu Fate, an official of the Yaman park said that they cautioned drivers in parks against operating in the night due to the high rate of insecurity on the roads.\n\n...",

          "text": "A resident electoral commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Samuel Egwu, has expressed dissatisfaction over the 2021 Anambra governorship election which has been declared inconclusive.\n\nMr Egwu, on Sunday, described the election as \u201cthe most difficult\u201d during a programme tagged; \u201cSunday Politics,\u201d on Channels Television.\n\nAccording to him, the low voter turnout in some polling units is one of the major problems experienced during the election, adding that it is not good for Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cI came into INEC in August 2017, since then, I have been part of many elections, so I can categorically say that this is the most difficult election that I have experienced,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn this particular election, as we have seen since yesterday, we have had problems with extreme situation of low voters turnout.\u201d\n\nMr Egwu attributed the low voter turnout to the fear that has been created in people and the IPOB sit-at-home order that was dissolved before the commencement of the election.\n\nHe also added that the low turnout was obvious in the three local governments he supervised \u2013 Onitsha North, Onitsha South and Ogbaru local government area.\n\n\u201cIn the three local governments, the registered voters are between 14000 and 15000, the number of people accredited on election day was between 1200 and 1500.\n\n\u201cThere is a whole gauge of fear that has been created and the threats of violence, and IPOB has been able to enforce overtime the sit-at-home order, so the fear of the repercussions that IPOB would do to people became a threat to the election,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on logistics, the commissioner disclosed that some of the contracted suppliers of election materials withdrew a day to election.\n\n\u201cIn many instances, we did the logistics, to procure the number of vehicles we needed to carry the personnel and materials, many of the suppliers committed to that but when it was time for election they withdrew from their promises, some reduced the number of vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe election\n\nChukwuma Soludo, the candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has so far secured the majority of the votes cast in Saturday\u2019s Anambra governorship election.\n\nThe results were formally announced at the INEC state collation centre in Awka, Anambra State, on Sunday.\n\nHowever, the electoral body has declared the election inconclusive as elections were not held in some parts of the state.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nIt is getting increasingly likely that the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chukwuma Soludo will emerge as the winner of the yet-to-be concluded Anambra State governorship election which commenced on Saturday.\n\nSoludo, who had earlier amassed more votes in each of the earlier announced six local government areas, has also led his opponents in two additional local government areas \u2013 Agwuata and Orumba North.\n\nHe won Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Valentine Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Aguata LGA, the three top contenders\u2019 native council. But the three gladiators had won in their respective polling units.\n\nIn a very likely event of the direction of victory remaining till the announcement of the final result, Soludo will begin to receive congratulatory messages for realizing an age-long dream of occupying the number one political office of Anambra State.\n\nIn a clime where corruption scandal is a common tag for public office holders, maintaining a spotless public image years after a five-year term of overseeing Nigeria\u2019s number one treasury house is not a common feat. That is the story of the last but one governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nSince leaving the CBN top job, the 60-year old professor of Economics has remained a star, meaning different things to different people who view him from the angles of excellence, integrity, performance or the rest of his core values.\n\nAs CBN governor, he demystified the banking sector, performing what most Nigerians thought was impossible, including the banking sector reform, a revolutionary recapitalization exercise that pruned operators with less than N25 billion capital base off the nation\u2019s banking landscape. The motive was to put an end to hitherto recurring bank liquidations that saw customers losing hard-earned deposits.\n\nThere is no gainsaying that the multiplier effect of that historic step was phenomenal as thousands of people secured jobs in the bigger banks that eventually emerged; many more jobs were created in companies financed by these bigger banks just as thousands of small, medium and large enterprises saw opportunities to access credit facilities from the banks. Also, hundreds of people that now have bureau de change and microfinance bank licenses, among others, owe their gratitude to the ingenuity of this radical economic thinker.\n\nSoludo served the federal government as chief economic adviser to former President Olusegum Obasanjo and chief executive officer of National Planning Commission during which he authored the economic agenda of the government called NEEDS.\n\nMany years down the line, the nation has not stopped tapping from his wealth of experience. Soludo currently serves as a member of the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) appointed by President Mohammadu Buhari, to replace the Economic Management Team of the federal government.\n\nEAC\u2019s mandate is to advise the president on economic policy matters, including fiscal analysis, economic growth and a range of internal and global economic issues working with the relevant cabinet members and heads of monetary and fiscal agencies.\n\nAn eminent patriot, Soludo has continued to contribute to nation building, taking positions on issues of serious national importance and proffering solutions to economic problems. For instance, in 2017, he insisted that Nigeria must take steps to eliminate the regime of multiple exchange rates, advising that the difference between the then official and parallel market exchange rates of the naira must be reduced to three to five per cent.\n\nOn the ravaging Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the erudite professor argued that it was wrong to adopt the \u2018cut and paste\u2019 approach to mitigating the pandemic in Nigeria and Africa. He advised African leaders to re-assess the total lockdown, insisting that the continent could not sustain a total economic shutdown. Arguing that the structures to support the lockdown in most African countries do not exist, he maintained that African leaders cannot continue to shut in citizens without food.\n\nWith a distinction in the West African School Certificate (WASC) from the Uga Boys Secondary School in Anambra State, a first class honours in Economics, MSc, PhD in Economics from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and promoted professor at the age of 38, having met the requirements to be professor at 32, Soludo has proved to be a gifted solution provider to social and economic problems of the world in general and Nigeria in particular.\n\nA world class technocrat and scholar, Soludo had lived in Ethiopia, United Kingdom, USA and travelled to 45 other countries around the world as consultant to countries and about 20 international development and financial institutions even before the federal government called him to serve Nigeria. His advice saved many countries and created millions of jobs. His is a story of a man who has earned his place as a global citizen and still remains a humble village boy as he prefers to call himself.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the world has honoured him with scores of awards among which was the best governor of the central bank in Africa and in the world at the time. Even many years after leaving office, Soludo is still recognized as one of the 100 most influential Africans. In Nigeria, he has received over 100 awards and honours, including the third highest national honour, Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (CFR).\n\nFormer President Obasanjo once described him as \u201cone of the leading lights of our nation whose leadership qualities are admirable and his willingness to listen and learn is simply infectious\u201d.",

We really do have alot to do.\u201d\n\nHe enjoined the Committee to come to the aid of the Tribunal, saying adequate funding and timely releases would enable the CCT to use all funds allocated to it and still follow the procurement procedures, its cumbersome nature notwithstanding.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee responded saying the panel is not impressed with the activities of CCT because it could not effectively utilise its meagre allocation.\n\n\u201cBasically, the agency is underfunded by the executive arm of the government. That is not to say that the little amount appropriated and released to the Tribunal would not be spent.\n\n\u201cWe have cried loud over the years but this has not been improved upon. Again, the agency is sleeping on its right,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called on President Buhari to improve on the yearly appropriation for the Public Complaints Commission, Code of Conduct Bureau and Code of Conduct Tribunal, whose mandate is to fight corruption, which is one of the cardinal goal of the present administration.\n\nHe also urged the CCT and CCB to seek the intervention of the President, saying, \u201cMatch to Mr President to improve your budget. For us, it is the envelope you are given that we will work upon.\u201d Nation\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Security Council, the African Union, and Kenya and Uganda have also called for a ceasefire in the conflict that has killed thousands of people.\n\nCanada, calling the situation in Ethiopia \u201crapidly evolving and deteriorating\u201d, has withdrawn the families of its embassy staff and non-essential Canadian employees, the foreign ministry said on Sunday.

They will never succeed, we are Ethiopians,\u201d said 37-year-old Tigist Lemma.\n\nThe conflict in the north of the country started a year ago when forces loyal to the TPLF seized military bases in the Tigray region. In response, Abiy sent troops, who initially drove the TPLF out of the regional capital, Mekelle, but have faced a sharp reversal since June this year.\n\nAddis Ababa Mayor Adanech Abiebe addressed protesters and cited Ethiopia\u2019s history of resisting colonial power to justify the war.\n\nThe conflict has killed thousands of people, forced more than 2 million from their homes and left 400,000 people in Tigray facing famine.\n\nU.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths travelled to Mekelle on Sunday and met women affected by the fighting and humanitarian partners, the U.N.\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.\n\nOCHA said he \u201cengaged with de facto authorities on the need for humanitarian access and protection of civilians through all areas under their control, and respect for humanitarian principles.\u201d\n\nUnder a state of emergency declared on Tuesday, the government can order citizens of military age to undergo training and accept military duties.\n\nReuters has not been able to confirm independently the extent of the TPLF advance. The TPLF and their allies told Reuters last week they were 325 km (200 miles) from the capital. The government accuses the group of exaggerating its gains.\n\nThe government has also complained about foreign media coverage of the conflict and some people at the rally held signs denouncing \u201cfake news\u201d in Ethiopia.\n\nBillene Seyoum, Abiy\u2019s spokesperson, said on Twitter on Saturday: \u201cOrchestrated media propaganda against Ethiopia is escalating \u2026 Despite it all Ethiopia will overcome!\u201d",

Corruption has destroyed things in Nigeria. Awolowo, Zik and Sardauna would not have achieved what they did then if the settings were the way they are now. They achieved that much because powers were concentrated at the regions.\u201d\n\nYerima recalled that back in 2007, he alongside and other human rights activists, came together to seek amendment of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThey drafted a constitution which they wanted the courts to compel the National Assembly and the Federal Government then to compare with the 1999 Constitution to see how the loopholes in the constitution can be addressed but the courts never responded.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution does not create room for an exit, or a referendum that would allow a group exit the country. We are of the view that a room for referendum should be created. Those agitating for secession should be allowed to have a referendum, let\u2019s see how popular the agitations are.

Ayuba Abok.\n\nThe coalition which is an umbrella body of about 74 civil society organisations, expressed concern at the turn of events in the aftermath of impeachment of the former Speaker, which it said was unhealthy for the much-needed peaceful atmosphere in the state.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, the Convener of the coalition, Comrade James Dauda who was flanked by other members maintained that attempt to whip up sentiment through spurious allegation that Governor Lalong was behind the impeachment of the former Speaker was not only condemnable but unacceptable in a democratic setting.\n\nThe group noted that the governor, who is the chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, NGF , was the first to grant judicial and legislative autonomy in Nigeria which the former Speaker enjoyed the privilege.\n\nIt wondered how members of the State House of Assembly, which is independent of the executive arm of government in the state, turned out to impeach its Speaker for reasons best known to them, yet the governor is being accused of \u2018behind the scene\u2019 role.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the press, we are aware that Plateau State House of Assembly was the first out of 36 States of the Federation to enjoy legislative and judicial autonomy, even when Hon.

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko and Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa had suffered serial closures over students protests bordering on fees hike.\n\n\u201cThe Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo shrank to a student population of 1,753 from over 9,000 due to fees increase. Most private residential accommodation for students in Owo are now empty. Even the economy of the ancient city has been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cParents and students of UNIMED received shockers of their lives when they noticed increment of fees with nearly 120% for 2021/2022 session. No explanation was given for this hike. Medical students have to pay as much as N1,320,000.00 as against N515,000.00 payable in the previous academic session (2020/2021).\n\n\u201cAt Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti students of Medicine and Surgery require only N468,750.00 for 2021/2022 Session. For Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye N176,396.00 will be enough for the same course\u201d.\n\nThe PDP said there is no justification for this continuous upward review of school fees when the economy of the state is practically comatose and workers\u2019 salaries are not only irregular but never paid in full.\n\nThe party called on Ondo State Chapter calls on the Governor and the APC led government to wear a human face in taking decisions that affect the well being of our future leaders.\n\nThe statement stressed, \u201d A government that only brings sorrow to the people through policies of this nature is no longer worthy of its stay in power.\n\n\u201cIf neighbouring States with lesser revenue are charging lesser fees, why must Ondo State breed University drop outs because of wickedness of one man?\n\n\u201cEducation is the only industry Ondo State is known for.

Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko and Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa had suffered serial closures over students protests bordering on fees hike.\n\n\u201cThe Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo shrank to a student population of 1,753 from over 9,000 due to fees increase. Most private residential accommodation for students in Owo are now empty. Even the economy of the ancient city has been adversely affected.\n\n\u201cParents and students of UNIMED received shockers of their lives when they noticed increment of fees with nearly 120% for 2021/2022 session. No explanation was given for this hike. Medical students have to pay as much as N1,320,000.00 as against N515,000.00 payable in the previous academic session (2020/2021).\n\n\u201cAt Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti students of Medicine and Surgery require only N468,750.00 for 2021/2022 Session. For Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye N176,396.00 will be enough for the same course\u201d.\n\nThe PDP said there is no justification for this continuous upward review of school fees when the economy of the state is practically comatose and workers\u2019 salaries are not only irregular but never paid in full.\n\nThe party called on Ondo State Chapter calls on the Governor and the APC led government to wear a human face in taking decisions that affect the well being of our future leaders.\n\nThe statement stressed, \u201d A government that only brings sorrow to the people through policies of this nature is no longer worthy of its stay in power.\n\n\u201cIf neighbouring States with lesser revenue are charging lesser fees, why must Ondo State breed University drop outs because of wickedness of one man?\n\n\u201cEducation is the only industry Ondo State is known for. If the incumbent administration cannot improve our lots, it is better not to complicate a bad situation\u201d.",

Series of investigations into recent multiple attempts to export illicit drugs to the UK led to the arrest of the drug dealer on Tuesday 2nd November, when he was caught with 78 parcels of Cannabis, concealed in black soap packs labelled as Dudu Osun, with a total weight of 12.250 kilograms heading to United Kingdom.\n\nFurther investigation also revealed that Okoli is the one behind the attempt to export 7.350kgs of Cannabis to the UK on Thursday 21st October, a consignment that was intercepted at NAHCO export shed of the MMIA.\n\nCuriously, a separate investigation by operatives of the Directorate of Operations and General Investigation, DOGI, of the Agency, attached to courier companies have equally traced two other attempts to export 47.7kgs of cannabis to the UK through courier firms, to Okoli after his agents arrested in the course of investigation named him as the owner of the consignments.\n\nIn the same vein, desperate bids by traffickers to export over 2 kilograms of Cocaine, Methamphetamine and Cannabis hidden inside containers of body cream, tea bags, vehicle oil and air filters to London, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirate and New Zealand through two major courier firms in Lagos have been scuttled by narcotic officers of the Agency.\n\nIn Kano, a controlled delivery of an illicit consignment on Friday 5th November led to the arrest of two suspects; Ibrahim Sulaiman and Muhammad Sani Alhassan with 23kgs of Diazepam tablets; 2kgs of Codeine syrup and 32kgs of Exol 5 tablets, bringing the total weight to 57kgs.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday 3rd November, operatives of the Kano command of the Agency had arrested one Mizambilu Tijjani, with 64kgs of Cannabis sativa and Victor Nsodikwa Chu-chu, with 34 cartons of Pentazocine injection and one carton of Diazepam injection in Sabongari area of the city.\n\nIn Kogi state, operatives also seized a consignment containing 28.251kgs of Exol- 5; 6.6kgs of Barcadin Codeine Syrup; over 38.532kgs of Tramadol, bringing the total drugs seized to 73.808kgs. In a related development, operatives of the Osun state command have seized 130.518kgs of cannabis and 18grams of Cocaine in Modakeke area of Ile-Ife.\n\nImpressed by the outcome of investigations that led to the dismantling of the drug syndicate led by Okoli in Lagos, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) commended the officers and men of the MMIA command, DOGI and their counterparts in Kano, Kogi and Osun for sustaining the heat on the cartels across the country.\n\nHe urged them and their compatriots in other commands to intensify the offensive action against all merchants of death in Nigeria.",

They were taken to the Police Hospital in Falomo for treatment and some of them have been discharged.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the full records of survivors in the incident. This gives a total of 15 people rescued alive. We have a total of 42 bodies that have been recovered,\u201d the governor explained.\n\nHe identified the latest survivors to include a 38-year-old woman, Glory Samsom, Ndajor Ahmed, Yunusa Abubaka, Ajiboye Habib, Jeremiah Samson, and one man identified as Emem.\n\nWhile most of them sustained varying degrees of injury, according to the governor, Samson, 20, is said to be in a coma.\n\nSanwo-Olu, also, said 49 families had filled the missing persons\u2019 register as at Saturday morning, saying the register had helped the state government to reconcile the details of victims rescued alive and also medically account for bodies recovered.\n\nThe governor said identification of bodies by relatives had commenced, adding that DNA examination was being undertaken on some of the bodies difficult to be identified by their families.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cThere is a sum of money that has been reserved by the state government for succour and to give for befitting burial for those who died in the incident.\n\n\u201cFamilies that wish to accept it are being supported for the burial arrangement. Also, survivors in hospitals have been given the financial support to help them settle and cope with challenges of feeding in the aftermath of the incident.\u201d\n\nTinubu, on Saturday, visited the site of the collapsed building in the company of Sanwo-Olu and his Nasarawa counterpart, Sule, among others.\n\nTinubu and Sule sympathised with families who lost their relatives and state government over the unfortunate tragedy.\n\nThe building collapsed on Monday with many artisans and others trapped in the rubble. Currently, 42 bodies have been recovered, 49 families filled the missing persons\u2019 registers while 15 rescued alive.\n\nThe state government had said families of the victims would go to the Infectious Disease Hospital, Yaba to identify the corpses recovered from the rubble.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Osinbajo has again warned media houses and online publishers against publications linking him with the 21-storey building that collapsed last week in Ikoyi, Lagos State.\n\nA statement entitled: \u2018Libelous Publications of and Concerning His Excellency, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Collapsed Ikoyi Building\u2019, issued by his lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), stated that the warning became necessary to explain the legal consequences of fabricating falsehood and unsubstantiated negative reports concerning the vice president.\n\nThe statement warned that in law, \u201cliability for libellous publications is not limited to the original author or publisher thereof, but it also extends to and includes all those who, out of sheer ignorance, mischief or malice, or all, cause any libellous publication to be repeated, reposted or re-published, either personally or through any platform for which they have control\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe are solicitors to His Excellency, the Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), on whose instruction we write, in respect of the above subject matter.\n\n\u201cWe have the mandate of our client to draw your esteemed attention to certain publications of and concerning him, in respect of the 21-storey building that recently collapsed in Ikoyi, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cThese publications believed to have been sponsored by faceless individuals and entities to tarnish the good name and reputation of our client, claim most spuriously, that our client is connected with the said building, one way or the other, without any scintilla of proof. For the records, our client is not involved in, associated, or connected with the ownership or development of the collapsed building, in any manner whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThis notice has thus become necessary, partly to explain the legal consequences of fabricating falsehood and unsubstantiated negative reports, of and concerning our client. In law, liability for libellous publications is not limited to the original author or publisher thereof, but it also extends to and includes all those who, out of sheer ignorance, mischief or malice, or all, cause any libellous publication to be repeated, reposted or re-published, either personally or through any platform for which they have control.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, we have the instructions of our client to compile and preserve the particulars of anyone found to have published, re-published or endorsed or consented to the publication, distribution or circulation of any libellous material, of and concerning him, to commence civil actions in court, in any jurisdiction where such publication occurs\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, implore you not to yield your noble platforms for the dissemination of any libellous publication of and concerning our client, henceforth.\u201d\n\nSegun James and Wale Igbintade",

However, the superior firepower of the security operatives led to the arrest of eight members of the notorious gang while some other members of the gang fled into the forest and nearby communities.\u201d\n\nIt said the FCT Police Commissioner, Mr. Babaji Sunday, enjoined residents particularly those around the Gwagwalada area of the FCT to be vigilant and provide the police with useful information that could assist in apprehending the gang members still at large while efforts were being intensified to arrest fleeing members of the gang.\n\nIt said all the suspects would be charged to court on conclusion of the investigations.\n\nThe CP disclosed that investigation was being accentuated while a dragnet was extended to arrest all the criminals.\n\nHe further implored residents to report all suspicious movements.\n\nMeanwhile, the FCT Police Command said it had launched an investigation into the kerosene tank explosion that killed five persons in Kubwa Village Market.\n\nThe inferno triggered by the explosion burnt many shops in the area.\n\nA statement by FCT Police Command said it had commenced investigations into the unfortunate fire incident.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command has commenced investigations into the unfortunate fire incident that occurred at the Kubwa Village Market of the FCT in the evening of November 5, 2021.\n\n\u201cPreliminary investigations, however, revealed that two shops in the market were affected in the fire incident following a kerosene surface tank explosion.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the remains of five persons already burnt beyond recognition were evacuated from the scene by the rescue team and taken to the hospital where they were confirmed dead while 10 others, who were seriously injured, were immediately taken to the hospital and presently receiving medical attention\u201d, it said.\n\nThe FCT Police Commissioner, who described the incident as unfortunate, ordered a discrete investigation into the incident.\n\nHe noted that operatives from the forensic section of the command\u2019s criminal investigations\u2019 department, were deployed to the scene for forensic analysis to unravel the cause of the incident and more importantly, provide recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence of such incident.\n\nBabaji commiserated with the families of the victims.\n\nHe affirmed that the inferno was under control and commended the people, who were at the scene at the time for supporting in the rescue operation and general control of the fire.\n\nNiger Demolishes Suspected Kidnapper\u2019s Home\n\nIn another development, the Niger State Government on Friday night demolished the home of a suspected notorious kidnapper.\n\nThe demolition exercise took place in the Nikangbe area of Bosso Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe state government\u2019s bulldozers carried out the exercise under the watchful eyes of the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Emmanuel Umar, in the presence of heavily armed security operatives.\n\nThe identity of the owner (suspected kidnapper) of the buildings was not disclosed.\n\nThe suspect was said to have started constructing the buildings about two months ago and completed one wing within one month.\n\n\u201cHe does not live in the building,\u201d one of the neighbours told THISDAY.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the neighbours became suspicious of the source of money for the construction because of the speed of construction work, leading to the information being leaked to the authorities.\n\nDiscreet investigation was said to have been carried out by security agents, which confirmed that the houses were being constructed from proceeds (ransom) of crime.\n\nIt was learnt that the suspect was subsequently arrested and taken to Abuja for further investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is a landmark achievement, I salute our law enforcement agencies for this great feat,\u201d Umar said, during the demolition exercise pointing out that: \u201cIt is a realisation of the state government\u2019s determination to go the extra mile to ensure restoration of peace in this state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a building owned by a kidnapper that has been arrested. It is from a proceed of crime and it is in our policy not to allow any criminality to reign in this state. We can establish this and that henceforth, we will not allow any criminal to have a place in our land. It is part of the determination of the governor to ensure Niger State is safe for us all\n\n\u201cThis action will serve as a deterrent and warning to other criminals that the state government would give no place to criminals to live in the state,\u201d the commissioner explained.\n\nThe commissioner however refused to give details of how the suspect was apprehended but said it was established that he (suspect) used part of the proceeds of the crime to construct the building\u201d.\n\nUmar said: \u201cIt is part of the policy of government not to allow any criminal to have a place in the state,\u201d adding that \u201cif they did not leave peacefully, the law will catch up with them and they will leave by force\u201d.\n\nHe disclosed that government has met with stakeholders in the state, including the landlord associations, estate owners, and hoteliers and has told them to report any suspicious movement or strangers moving into the society. \u201cI hope we get more information to act on and make the state safe,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Ward Head of Kpakungun who oversees Nkangbe, Alhaji Tanko Ibrahim commended the action of the state government saying \u201cif followed judiciously, it will help to keep the state safe.\n\nIn June this year, the State House of Assembly passed a bill imposing capital punishment on kidnappers, bandits, and their informants.\n\nThe bill also provides that anyone found guilty of kidnapping, banditry, and of being their informants will face a death sentence.\n\nThe bill assented to by Governor Abubakar Bello, which necessitated the demolition exercise, was designed to check the increasing wave of kidnapping and banditry in the state and strengthen the fight against criminalities by the state government.\n\nThe bill also states that anyone found guilty of the offence of banditry, kidnapping, or giving out information that results in kidnapping and banditry will be sentenced to death by hanging in public.\n\nAbout seven local governments areas in Niger State have in the last one year been under the siege of bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers leading to over 3,500 people being displaced and about 400 killed in the affected local government areas.\n\nThe LGAs under the siege of bandits are: Munya, Shiroro, Rafi, Wushishi, Mariga, Mashegu and Magama.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna",
