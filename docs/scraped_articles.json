We are of the opinion that if Mr Oriyomi Hamzat\u2019s phone number and call logs are subjected to diligent investigation, the identity or identities of some of your men that are sabotaging your commendable efforts on this case may be revealed.\n\n\u201cFinally, sir, we humbly demand that Mr Oriyomi Hamzat be invited, questioned and possible criminal charges filed against him for defamation, character assassination, cyberbullying, misinformation and inciting the public against the police authority in a manner that may derail police investigations and cause perversion of the course of justice.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We ask that our military step up on the onslaught against criminal elements who have vowed to make life a living hell for innocent Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe union submitted that the deployment of proactive intelligence, active surveillance and hi-tech weaponry would be useful in combating and conquering the barbarism being exhibited by the terrorists.\n\nAlso, it urged that a strong military presence be established to protect vulnerable villages, especially after bombardments, adding that slow responses to emergencies did not speak well of the military.\n\n\u201cWe demand a rapid response to crisis situations by our security forces. That terrorist went on a bloody prowl for nearly 48 hours unchecked does not speak well of the emergency capabilities of our security system. The way security forces respond to emergency situations is a measure of the premium placed on the lives of Nigerians \u2013 whether 58 or 200,\u201d Wabba stated.\n\nThe Congress observed that military operations alone may not quell the insurgency in the North, urging the government to create jobs for the youths and social security cover for vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Nyesom Wike, have predicted victory for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBoth governors spoke on Monday when Wike visited Diri at the Government House in Yenagoa.\n\nAccording to Diri, only PDP can rescue Nigeria from insecurity and economic downturn.\n\nHe said the party had been repositioned to be able to clinch the presidency in 2023.\n\nHe further said that PDP had the pedigree to give Nigerians hope and a sense of direction.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThe presidency is one sacred office and we must do everything to protect it and ensure that our party clinches victory in the 2023 polls.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing for our party is our unity. Second is who becomes president.\n\n\u201cWe have a capable national chairman that can steer us back to power in 2023,\u201d the Bayelsa governor said.\n\nHe commended Wike for demonstrating leadership and purposeful governance.\n\nHe underscored the need for greater unity among the states of the Niger Delta region to enable them to tackle their common challenges, particularly environmental pollution and underdevelopment.\n\n\u201cBayelsa and Rivers are sister-states historically and culturally and if anyone is trying to divide us, we must come against them.\n\n\u201cI call on Ijaw leaders to come together and amicably resolve whatever issues we may have.\n\n\u201cWithin a family, we will always have issues but that should not remove our brotherliness,\u201d Diri said.\n\nHe further commended Wike for his role in ensuring that PDP was repositioned, describing him as a committed party man.\n\nIn a remark, Wike expressed confidence that PDP would produce the next president of Nigeria.\n\nHe emphasised the need for unity of purpose between Bayelsa, Rivers and PDP, saying that success would elude the party, if members failed to form a united front\n\nHe lauded Duri for his developmental efforts and commitment to the party and urged the people of the state to continue to support him.\n\n\u201cToday, I came to let everybody know that Douye Diri is one of the governors I can tell you has shown commitment even though he is new.\n\n\u201cHe believes in the development of his state.\n\n\u201cI have also come to tell him that everybody must work together to make PDP united because without party there cannot be a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cLet us all unite.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe All Progress Congress (APC) national leader and former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said he has told President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to vie for the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nHe said as a democrat, President Buhari did not stop him from attempting to pursuing his life-long ambition.\n\nThe party chieftain said this while responding to questions from State House Correspondents after he met the president in his office at the presidential villa, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAsked if he had informed Buhari of his ambition, the APC chieftain said: \u201cI will answer that with categorical yes. I\u2019ve informed the president of my intention but I have not informed Nigerians yet. I\u2019m still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. And I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people will I consult. You will soon hear, all you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You\u2019ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr. President of my ambition, you don\u2019t expect more answers than that.\u201d\n\nOn the president\u2019s response, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s our business. He is a democrat. He didn\u2019t ask me to stop. He didn\u2019t ask me not to attempt and pursue my ambition, it\u2019s a lifelong ambition. So, why do you expect him to say more than that? You are running a democratic dispensation, and you must adopt the principles and the values and the virtues of democracy. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHe declined to comment on what a race for the APC ticket between him and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo whose support groups have been mobilising for his candidacy would look like.\n\nAccording to him, with what he did in Lagos as governor, he has the capacity to rule Nigeria.\n\nOn Osinbajo\u2019s potential ambition, Tinubu maintained that he would not discuss any individual.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself. I have the confidence, the vision, the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President, and turn Nigeria better. I\u2019ve have done that with commitment and unyielding\u2026 you know, in Lagos State. You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.\n\n\u201cYou know, the confusion, the drift of the past in PDP is being corrected. And you can\u2019t take away from that. As we are today, go back to the data on how many barrels of oil we were producing when we first came in and what it is today. We cannot even\u2026 at the time we came in, we did not pay the counterpart funds to start our rail line. Today, you enjoy the comfort of having rail from Lagos to Ibadan, you have the Kaduna and you have the one for Kano State on the aggressive pipeline, you see excellent infrastructure. I just came from Azare and I have seen good roads, the carnage of dying on motor vehicles is reducing except you know, lack of compliance with a lot of Nigerian drivers and VIOs. Let us think back, let us be intellectually inquisitive as to the past and the present and what the future holds for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked why he would not remain a kingmaker rather than being the king, he said there was nothing that stops a kingmaker from becoming the king unless he has committed murder.\n\n\u201cAbout the cap of king maker. I\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless you commit murder. So, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and your story based upon your own perception.\u201d\n\nOn the direct primaries and the convention, he said: \u201cFirst of all, the National Assembly and the president must be encouraged to review and review again. Whatever they come up with as electoral amendment is what we must comply with. There is no unlimited elasticity in what we face because we have to plan and plan well, and be able to manage the time effectively. The great roadmap to success is the ability of a leader to do what he must do at the right time that it should be done. So, to me, the electoral amendment point, we will still look at that collectively. And it is our country. It\u2019s our democracy. We had adopted it and we will push it rigorously.\u201d\n\nOn the ruling party\u2019s convention, he said: \u201cIt is certain that we are going to get it.\u201d\n\nAsked when he responded: \u201cOh, well\u2026 I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the party. And the president is the leader of the party. So, expect convention, maybe if that\u2019s added to your own anxiety, or the other party\u2019s anxiety, it\u2019s is good for us. We get it and we\u2019ll get it done properly.\u201d\n\nOn the purpose of his visit, Tinubu said he came to see the President on general issues concerning Nigeria, including the ruling political party, security issues, the achievement and the New Year Agenda.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nSouth\u2013South leader, Chief Edwin Clark has reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Channels Television interview where he again rejected the clamour for state police as a solution to worsening security situation in the country.\n\nThe president had said: \u201cState police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local governments and the governors. Are the third tiers of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Let the people in local government tell you the truth; the fight between local governments and the governor.\u201d\n\nBut Clark, a former minister of information and leader of Pan Niger Delta Delta Forum (PANDEF) said Buhari was also guilty of the excuse that governors would misuse state police. He alleged that the current administration was also using the police to persecute perceived political opponents, thereby undermining the National Assembly and obstructing free speeches.\n\nHe said it was unconstitutional and authoritative for Mr. president to say that state police, which was even recommended by the Governor El-Rufai Committee as one of its items under devolution of power to be transferred from the Executive List in Schedule 1 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, to Schedule II of the Concurrent List, should be discarded.\n\nHe therefore urged President Buhari to give in to the demands of allowing the creation of state police.\n\nHe stated this in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, entitled, \u201dMajority of Nigerians believe in state police because it is one cardinal points or one of the ingredients in a federal system of government.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said the truth and not lies remain essential in running a democratic government and that there was the need for proper guidance, survival and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cMr President dismissed the call for state police in the country. He said that state police was not an option, that governors will misuse it. He gave an unrelated instance of the relationship between state governors and local governments, that there is no functional local government in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile the president is right that no local government in this country truly functions as provided by the constitution, not even the joint account under which state governments receive monies on behalf of the local governments, because the accounts are fully controlled by the state governors, it is not enough to dismiss the demand for state police.\n\n\u201cIt may be necessary to refer to some Sections of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution. Section 214 (1) says: There shall be a police force for Nigeria, which shall be known as the Nigerian Police force, and subject to the provisions of this section no other police shall be established for the federation or any part thereof.\n\n\u201cAnd Section 215 (4) says subject to the provisions of this section, the governor of a state or such commissioner of the government of the state as he may authorise in that behalf, may give to the commissioner of police of that state such lawful directions with respect to the maintenance and securing of public safety and public order within the state as he may consider necessary, and the commissioner of police shall comply with those directions or cause them to be complied with provided that before carrying out any such directions under the foregoing provisions of this subsection the commissioner of police may request that the matter be referred to the president or such minister of the government of the federation as may be authorised in that behalf by the President for his directions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI humbly submit that the above Section 214 (1), does not portray tenets of a federal system of government, but a unitary form of government. Hence the 1999 Constitution is rejected by democratic Nigerians who believe in a federal system of government. In a similar manner, Section 215 (4), does not really contain the ingredients of a federal system of government. As I stated in my recent interview, state p oleic is a popular agitation by Nigerians and was robustly discussed and agreed upon during the 2014 National Conference.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nNigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has advised members of the National Assembly, particularly members of House of Representatives, to drop their proposed bill meant to outlaw strikes and other industrial actions, particularly by health care workers under the umbrella of Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU).\n\nA House of Representatives member from Enugu State, Simon Atige, had championed a bill entitled: \u2018An Act to amend the Trade Disputes Act, cap T8, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, meant to prohibit medical practitioners in the employment of federal, state and local governments in the \u2018essential service\u2019 sectors, from embarking on strikes.\n\nThe bill was also meant to accelerate administrative and judicial proceedings in the determination of trade disputes involving them and related matters.\n\nNLC said the move was a deliberate attempt to gag the workers and legally weaken their strength, so they can loose legal backing to pursue their legitimate rights which mostly come from strike and other industrial actions, and they won\u2019t accept it.\n\nNLC President, Ayuba Wabba, who addressed journalists in Abuja, on the proposed bill, said Nigerian workers won\u2019t accept the bill, and would use all available means and strength to stop it.\n\nWabba said the proposed bill was an outright violation of fundamental human rights of workers, and also a violation of some sections of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, particularly on the Freedom of Association which Nigeria is a signatory to.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe NLC president disagreed with the plan to categorise health care workers under JOHESU as \u2018essential\u2019 service providers by the bill, hence they won\u2019t be entitled to strike. He, thereby, made reference to some sections of the ILO document particularly on Freedom of Association which only recognised air traffic controllers as essential service workers.\n\nWabba said: \u201cCompilation 769 of the ILO treaty stated clearly that strikes aimed at increase in wages and payment of wage arrears falls within the scope of legitimacy of trade union activities.\n\n\u201cAlso, compilation 751 stated that the right of workers to strike constitute a fundamental human rights of workers and their organisation, especially unions. Besides, strikes are used as means of defending the economy, social rights and interests of workers.\u201d\n\nHe, however, promised that NLC won\u2019t be confrontational in its approach against the lawmakers, rather it would adopt the option of lobbying and other means to pacify the lawmakers, and properly educate them on the dangers of their steps and the need to retrace the steps for the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cThis move by lawmakers is laughable and a display of ignorance of the ILO conventions. Obviously, those proposing this law against strike by health workers are not aware of the ILO conventions, hence they are taking the wrong steps. Nigeria, through the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, is aware of the ILO conventions, and often provide reports on the compliance to the ILO authorities, periodically.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022AGF, BPP back Bala-Usman\n\n\u2022President orders conclusion of procurement process within 60 days\n\nEromosele Abiodun\n\nThe battle by INTELS Nigeria Limited to retain its service boat contract in the pilotage district of Lagos, Warri, Bonny, Port-Harcourt and Calabar, which expired on August 8, 2020, has met a dead end with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cancellation of the January 2021 directive to restore the contract.\n\nTHISDAY reliably gathered that the president took the decision following advice from the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Director General Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), and Acting Director-General, Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission (ICRC), that unanimously advised the president against the restoration of the contract.\n\nThe development was seen as major victory for the suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Bala-Usman whose alleged sin was failing to honour a presidential directive on the said contract.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi had listed failure to honour a presidential directive on the restoration of INTELS pilotage contract as terms of reference for the panel of enquiry set up to probe the NPA.\n\nThis was despite Bala-Usman\u2019s explanation that the president had withdrawn the directive pending further advice from the Attorney- General of the Federation and the Bureau of Public Procurement(BPP).\n\nThe terms of reference read: \u201cExamine and investigate issues leading to the termination of pilotage other contracts of NPA and confirm compliance with the terms of the respective contracts, court ruling and presidential directive.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter addressed to the AGF and the Minister of Transportation, with reference number: SH/COS/23/A/229, dated January 7, 2022, and singed by the Chief of Staff (COS) to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, seen by THISDAY, the president directed that the procurement process initiated by the procuring entity, NPA, that was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Transportation be forwarded immediately to the BPP for action.\n\nThe COS in the letter stated: \u201cThe president has also directed that upon receipt of the No-objection approval from the BPP, a memorandum be presented by the Ministry of Transportation to the Federal Executive Council for consideration, that the Ministry of Transportation should ensure that the process is concluded within 60 days of the president\u2019s directive to avoid further loss of revenue by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat NPA should ensure that the sanctity of the agreements with respect to Onne 4 (Berths 9, 10 & 11) be maintained, as there is no subsisting contract with INTELS for their utilisation.\u201d\n\nBuhari also directed the AGF to ensure quick determination of the cases in court in view of their economic importance, stressing that the above set of directives prior approval dated January 22, 2021 granted on the matter.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Buhari decided to act after reading the submissions of both the AGF and BPP who expressly warned of the danger of further litigations if the pilotage contract is restored.\n\nThe AGF had two months ago written to the president after a review of submissions by the NPA and INTELS.\n\nIn the letter dated November 18, 2021, with reference MJ/DSD/23/VII, seen by THISDAY, the AGF had stated that the NPA neither suspended nor terminated any of its contracts with INTELS, \u201cwhich therefore obviates the need for any restoration.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is certainty in the duration of the contract and the position of the law remains clear that a written contract freely entered into by the parties is binding on them. \u201cAccordingly, the contract for Managing Agent awarded to Messrs INTELS in 2007 validly came to an end and extinguished pursuant to the terms of agreement between the parties, which specified an end date of August 2020. The agreement did not provide for any further extension of the contract in favour of INTELS.\n\n\u201cIt is also to be noted that NPA pursuant to the expiration of the contract, kick-started the procurement process to appoint another managing agent in order to forestall any break in the service being rendered.\n\n\u201cNPA submitted that it concluded the tender/bidding process and forwarded the result to the Minister of Transportation for same to be presented for FEC\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\nINTELS, the AGF added, resorted to litigation to frustrate the conclusion of the procurement process based on its grievance on a different subject-matter.\n\nThe development, the AGF added, had created a vacuum in the provision of this critical service in the maritime sector with its attendant loss of revenue from service boat operation to the federal government.\n\nThe AGF also stressed that the approval granted by the president in January last year, which Bala-Usman was said to have disobeyed, was based on insufficient information at the time.\n\nThe purported termination, he concluded, could not have occurred since the contract came to an end in 2020 based on the agreement by the parties.\n\nIn the same vein, the BPP denounced claims by the Ministry of Transportation and urged the president not to restore the contract to avoid further litigation.\n\nThe BPP in a letter addressed to the COS to the president, with reference, BPP/DG/2021/007, dated March 9, 2021, had stated that the decision by the NPA to initiate a procurement process in anticipation of the expiration of the contract for boat operation managing agent was in order.\n\nThe BPP in the letter signed by its Director General, Mamman Ahmadu, concluded that, \u201cThere is a compelling need to ensure that contractors and service providers do not take undue advantage of government agencies and do not obtain contracts from government agencies through the court rooms.\n\n\u201cThe correct procedure is that contracts should be won through a proper procurement process that complies with the provisions of the PPA, 2007. Furthermore, there is need to avoid the kind of monopoly currently enjoyed by Messrs INTELS which has cascaded into entitlement mentality being demonstrated by the firm.\n\n\u201cAlso, monopoly will inevitably result in charging a higher price to the consumer/client than what is obtainable from a competitive market, thereby eroding value for money.\u201d\n\nThe NPA and INTELS have since 2020 disagreed over the renewal of the pilotage or boat service contract.\n\nThe Nigerian Ports Authority insisted that the 10 years contract with INTELS expired on August 8, 2020, after which it initiated procurement processes for the contract.\n\nThe NPA thereafter submitted the outcome of the procurement process, which the Authority says INTELS participated in, to the Minister who, rather than forward same to BPP, sought the approval of the President to restore the contract to INTELS. This situation has brought the boat pilotage service operations to a standstill for about 16 months, with attendant revenue losses to the nation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Informs Buhari of his intention to contest in 2023\n\n\u2022Says he is not done consulting, boasts capacity to succeed current govt\n\n\u2022Dismisses anything unusual in kingmaker becoming king\n\n\u2022Knocks PDP for creating nation\u2019s woes APC is trying to solve\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nA national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday, described as his lifelong ambition, the nation\u2019s presidency and disclosed that he had decided to give it a shot in 2023.\n\nThus, as part of steps to realising this ambition, Tinubu formally made his aspiration known to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, clearing years of speculations about his intentions.\n\nTinubu, who by his disclosure, put paid to speculations around his ambition, told newsmen after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, that, \u201cI\u2019ve informed the president of my intention, but I have not informed Nigerians yet. I\u2019m still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people I will consult.\n\n\u201cYou will soon hear. All you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You\u2019ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr. President of my ambition, and you don\u2019t expect more answers than that.\u201d\n\nAsked what the response of the president was to his ambition, the former two-time Lagos State governor replied, \u201cThat\u2019s our business. He is a democrat. He didn\u2019t ask me to stop. He didn\u2019t ask me not to attempt and pursue my ambition, which is a lifelong ambition.\n\n\u201cSo, why do I expect him to say more than that? You are running a democratic dispensation, and you must adopt the principles and the values and the virtues of democracy. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nTinubu also said he was at the Villa to see the president on wide-ranging national issues, \u201cincluding our political party, APC, security issues, the achievement, and the New Year Agenda.\u201d\n\nHe stated that it was not in his character to discuss other presidential hopefuls, saying he is out to market himself, as he possesses the capacity and vision to lead Nigeria, having successfully governed Lagos State.\n\nThe APC leader stated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself. I have the confidence, the vision, the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President, and turn Nigeria better. I\u2019ve done that with commitment, you know, in Lagos State. You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.\u201d\n\nOn whether it wouldn\u2019t be ideal for him to remain a kingmaker instead of becoming a king himself, Tinubu emphasised that there was nothing wrong in a kingmaker aspiring to be king. He said, satirically, that he had never seen the cap of a kingmaker before.\n\nTinubu explained further, \u201cThat is the truth. And I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rulebook anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king, unless you commit murder. So, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and your story based upon your own perception.\u201d\n\nOn the Electoral Act Amendment Bill that was rejected by the president, the APC leader stressed the need for both the executive and the legislative arms to collaborate and come up with a realistic electoral bill.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe National Assembly and the president must be encouraged to review the Electoral Act Bill again and again. Whatever they come up with, as electoral amendment, is what we must comply with. There is no unlimited elasticity in what we face, because we have to plan and plan well, and be able to manage the time effectively.\n\n\u201cThe great roadmap to success is ability of a leader to do what he must do at the right time that it should be done. So, that to me, the electoral amendment bill, we will still look at that collectively. And it is our country. It\u2019s our democracy. We had adopted it and we will push it.\u201d\n\nTinubu took a swipe at the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the mess Nigeria found itself before APC came to power in 2015, saying the drift is being corrected by the Buhari administration.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou know, the confusion, the drift of the past in PDP, is being corrected. And you can\u2019t take away from that. As we are today, go back to the data on how many barrels of oil we were producing, when we first came in and what it is today. We could not even at the time we came in pay the counterpart funds to start our rail line.\n\n\u201cToday, you enjoy the comfort of having rail from Lagos to Ibadan, you have the Kaduna and you have the one for Kano State in the pipeline, you see excellent infrastructure. I just came from Azare and I have seen good roads\u2026\n\n\u201cLet us think back, let us be intellectually inquisitive as to the past and the present and what the future holds for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSee full text of Tinubu\u2019s exchange with State House Correspondents below:\n\nSHC: Why are you here?\n\nTINUBU: I will not answer that question when I have not lost my citizenship. I came to see the President on general issues concerning Nigeria, including our political party, APC, security issues, the achievement and the New Year Agenda. That\u2019s all I can tell you. The new strategy that we must have, party congresses and all that.\n\nSHC: President Buhari recently said he did not want to divulge his favorite for the APC 2023 presidential ticket. Nigerians will like to know, have you informed your president, because they are urging you to come out and contest. Have you informed him about your ambition?\n\nTINUBU: I can answer that with categorical yes. I\u2019ve informed the President of my intention but I have not informed Nigerians yet. I\u2019m still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. And I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people will I consult.

He is a democrat. He didn\u2019t ask me to stop. He didn\u2019t ask me not to attempt to pursue my ambition; it\u2019s a lifelong ambition. So, why do I expect him to say more than that? You are running a democratic dispensation, and you must adopt the principles and the values and the virtues of democracy. That\u2019s it.\n\nSHC: We have seen a number of support groups, drumming up support for your ambition, that of Vice President Osinbajo and Governor of Kogi State too. What\u2019s your perspective on this? How do you see a potential race between you and these other persons for the APC ticket?\n\nTINUBU: I don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself. I have the confidence, the vision, the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President, and turn Nigeria better. I\u2019ve done that with commitment and unyielding, you know, in Lagos State. You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.\n\nYou know, the confusion, the drift of the past in PDP is being corrected. And you can\u2019t take away from that. As we are today, go back to the data on how many barrels of oil were we producing when we first came in and what it is today. We cannot even at the time we came in, pay the counterpart funds to start our rail line.\n\nToday, you enjoy the comfort of having rail from Lagos to Ibadan; you have the Kaduna and you have the one for Kano State. On the aggressive pipeline, you see excellent infrastructure. I just came from Azare and I have seen good roads, the carnage of dying on motor vehicles is reducing except you know, lack of compliance with a lot of Nigerian drivers and VIOs. Let us think back, let us be intellectually inquisitive as to the past and the present and what the future holds for Nigeria.\n\nSHC: Tinubu as Nigeria\u2019s President, what do we hope to see?\n\nTINUBU: You want my manifesto now? Not yet. Not yet.\n\nSHC: I would like you to speak on the direct primaries and the convention. And secondly, what would be your response to those that say, the cap of being a kingmaker fits you more than you throwing your self into the ring; that you should remain a kingmaker?\n\nTINUBU: First of all, the National Assembly and the president must be encouraged to review and review again. Whatever they come up with on the electoral amendment is what we must comply with. There is no unlimited elasticity in what we face, because we have to plan and plan well, and be able to manage the time effectively.\n\nThe great roadmap to success is the ability of a leader to do what he must do at the right time that it should be done. So, that to me, the electoral amendment point, we will still look at that collectively. And it is our country. It\u2019s our democracy. We had adopted it and we will push it rigorously.\n\nAbout the cap of kingmaker. I\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country, that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless you commit murder. So, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and your story based upon your own perception. Convention? It is certain that we are going to get it.\n\nSHC: When next month?\n\nTINUBU: Oh, well, I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the party. And the President is the leader of the party. So, expect convention, maybe if that\u2019s added to your own anxiety, or the other party\u2019s anxiety is good for us. We get it and we\u2019ll get it done properly.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NLC demands drastic action to end bloodletting\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), has described the recent killings in Zamfara villages by terrorists as nothing but satanic.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, stated this in a statement issued yesterday.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), has asked the federal government, to take very drastic steps to bringing an end to the current orgy of bloodletting, destruction of property and displacement of people in the country.\n\nThe APC, while expressing its heartfelt condolences to the families that lost their loved ones and also commiserated with the government and people of Zamfara state, assured the people that the killings in Zamfara state and elsewhere would not go unpunished.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, \u201cThe All Progressives Congress (APC) is deeply pained and condemns the recent killings of innocent Nigerians in their villages in Zamfara State by criminal gangs, also known as bandits.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the recent designation of these satanic, evil and criminal elements as terrorist groups will further buoy our security services to deal with them as such and ultimately, contain their nefarious activities in the country.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party commended the military and other security services, whose concerted onslaught on the camps of the criminals was ensuring the rescue of kidnapped citizens and neutralising the criminal elements.\n\nThe party noted that already, the terrorists had begun to flee as troops clearance operations had forced their dislodgement from their enclaves, urging Nigerians to watch out and report any suspicious movement.\n\nThe NLC, while reacting to the recent massacre of some villagers in Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas of Zamfara State, said there should be rapid response to such crisis situations by the security forces.\n\nA statement signed by the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, condemned the wickedness and inhumanity of terrorists, saying government should take drastic action to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must take very drastic steps to bring a firm closure to the current ogre of bloodletting, destruction of property and displacement of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe commend the gallantry and sacrifice of our soldiers and other armed services personnel in the current war against terrorists. We ask that our military step up on the onslaught against criminal elements, who have vowed to make life a living hell for innocent Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nWabba said the deployment of proactive intelligence, active surveillance and hi-tech weaponry would be useful in combating and conquering the new strain of barbarism and desperation being exhibited by the terrorists and urged that strong military presence should be established to protect vulnerable villages especially, after bombardments.\n\nWhile faulting the responses of security agents to emergency security situations like the what happened in Zamfara villages, Wabba said the fact that terrorists went on a bloody prowl for nearly 48 hours unchecked does not speak well of the emergency capabilities of our security system.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe way security forces respond to emergency situations is a measure of the premium placed on the lives of Nigerians \u2013 whether 58 or 200. We call on our security agents to intensify manhunt for the criminal elements and terrorists that perpetrated the recent pogrom in Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Areas of Zamfara and either bring them to justice or take justice to them.\n\n\u201cWe also call on the relevant agencies of government to ensure that relief materials are immediately dispatched to families displaced by this attack. Finally, the findings from the recent NLC Security Summit and Social Protection Roundtable show that bombs and bullets alone will not win the war on terrorism and secure the peace.\n\n\u201cWe urge government at all levels to fix the social dislocations at the root of deteriorating security situation in our country. Government should prioritize the creation of decent jobs for our youths, extension of social security cover to vulnerable Nigerians, promotion of the rule of law and institutionalization of good governance. The foregoing issues are the fulcrum of the Charter of Demands by Nigerian Workers.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Unchecked ambition, lax regulations: The genesis of predatory digital lenders in Nigeria",
          "text": "Ebuka Anyaeji thought he had seen it all, so when he first received a threat message about being a guarantor to a debtor on the run, he dismissed it as a joke, a message sent by an angry creditor to the wrong phone number. But the messages (WhatsApp and text) kept coming in; then Anyaeji found out his friends were also getting the same.\n\nLater on, the harassment moved from messages to phone calls\u2014real-time and pre-recorded calls. The content of the messages transitioned from just informing him that someone was owing the creditor money to threatening to embarrass him if he didn\u2019t get the defaulting debtor in question to pay.\n\n\u201cThe messages typically went along this line: \u2018This person is owing us money, and you\u2019re one of his guarantors. Tell him to pay or else we\u2019ll embarrass both of you\u2019,\u201d Anyaeji told TechCabal. \u201cIn some instances, they mentioned the amount of money owed, which was surprisingly low\u2014about \u20a610,000 ($17.8) or \u20a630,000 ($53.6)\u2014or in other cases they just referred to the debtor as a chronic debtor or fraudulent individual.\u201d\n\nOut of the numerous messages he\u2019s gotten, there\u2019s been only one occasion where he knew the debtor being referred to\u2014a university mate. What did he do about this case? He didn\u2019t bother informing the person, because they weren\u2019t close.\n\nA screenshot of Anyaeji\u2019s Whatsapp chat.\n\nFor Anyaeji, who now occasionally dishes out witty responses to the senders of these messages just for fun, he wonders why the debt collection practices of digital lenders like Soko Loan, LCash, 9Jacash among others use shaming tactics and, more importantly, whether this new trend would continue unchecked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this\n\nThere is no doubt that Africans have embraced taking loans through digital-lending apps. They are discreet, quick to access, and require no collateral. But this also means lenders who use the repayment habits of users to gauge their creditworthiness\u2014and never physically meet their customers\u2014often struggle with loan repayment.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been like this in Nigeria. Loans were primarily issued out by traditional banks, who rarely ever gave out loans without the backing of collateral or guarantors.\n\nIn the case of a loan default, before it ever gets to the point where a defaulting debtor\u2019s collateral is seized, there are a number of checks put in place. First, loans are given only after credit checks have been run and the account relationship manager can vouch for a potential borrower. When a borrower defaults, the account relationship manager first reaches out to the lender to find out the reason, and even visits to confirm. Guarantors and referees are also contacted, if need be.\n\n\u201cAs long as both parties are open and transparent, penalty charges don\u2019t come in yet. Until when they\u2019re past due obligations, which is typically over 90 days,\u201d an employee of a Nigerian bank, who spoke under anonymity, told TechCabal.\n\nOftentimes, while the account officer is following up with the defaulting customer, the monitoring team and even bank directors can also check up on the defaulting customer. The conversations typically revolve around ascertaining the repayment ability of the customer, restructuring the loan to extend the tenure and possibly waiving off penalty charges.\n\nIf all efforts to reach a reasonable agreement or recover the debt fail, the bank reverts to possessing the item\u2014usually a house or car\u2014used as collateral. This is a last resort that the bank isn\u2019t keen on exercising, another banker told TechCabal. \u201cWe detest having to possess people\u2019s lands or houses, which serve as collateral; the bank is not into real estate,\u201d he said.\n\nHow did lending apps come into the picture?\n\nFor a long time, Nigerian banks preferred to lend to businesses and not individuals. This led to the rise of new lenders like Carbon (formerly Paylater), Renmoney, and Branch that have filled the gap by offering quick loans through smartphone apps.\n\nTemi Sodipo, a credit risk analyst recalls the early days when there were only a few prominent Nigerian digital lenders like Renmoney and Paylater. But, as the years went by, new digital lenders popped up at different corners. People were at first skeptical but, over time, consumer confidence grew.\n\n\u201cI remember in late 2017 when we disbursed \u20a61 billion ($1.8m) in loans at Renmoney, we had a party to celebrate. In early 2019, when we issued \u20a64 billion ($7.3m) loans, it was just a normal month,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more digital lenders coming into the space, Sodipo believes that, despite the fact that many claim they\u2019re getting more people financially included, most digital lenders serve the same set of people because the terms for accessing the loans are similar. The terms include a six-month-long bank statement, verifiable government ID, employment letter, or work email verification.\n\nHe believes this has created an avenue for a few ambitious players who wanted a slice of the market to become lax with their rules. Some digital lenders even started giving out loans to people with bad ratings on credit bureau\u2014an obvious red flag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder why they turn to desperate debt collection measures as they contend with a high rate of default. It\u2019s simply bad underwriting and not paying attention to basic credit risk principles,\u201d Sodipo said.\n\nCommercial banks also started dishing out instant loans\n\nIn 2020, at least half of the 22 existing Nigerian commercial banks started offering instant loan products without collaterals, something that was unheard of years ago. What was the driver of this move? A new directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN announced an increase in the required minimum Loan-Deposit Ratio (LDR) of commercial banks to 60% from 57.64%. At the end of September, it further increased the LDR to 65%. LDR stipulates the volume of loans a bank must give out as a percentage of its total deposit. In the case of 65% LDR, it meant that if, for instance, a bank has \u20a6100 billion of customer deposits, it must have at least \u20a665 billion issued as loans. The increase was done to encourage commercial banks to issue more loans to individuals and businesses in order to stimulate the economy.\n\nTo avoid the sanctions that came with not meeting the LDR, these commercial banks began offering instant loan products without collaterals at risk of high repayment default rate. When debtors defaulted, the banks, however, unlike digital lenders, responded differently to the defaults.\n\nA source familiar with this incident told TechCabal that, unlike the digital lenders, these big commercial banks can afford to introduce these types of loans and make a loss on them, considering that they make tens and hundreds of billions of naira in profit.\n\nIn addition to being able to absorb the loss, the CBN issued a directive\u2014the Global Standing Instructions (GSI) policy\u2014that gave banks the right to deduct the amount owed from the bank account of the loan defaulters in other banks, in order to reduce the amount of non-performing loans\u2014a move that reduced the chances of defaulting customers owing while having money with other banks.\n\nOptions available to digital lenders\n\nCurrently, digital lenders don\u2019t have the right to debit the accounts of loan defaulters in other banks via GSI, so they rely on automated card debits, repayment reminders, and reporting customers to the credit bureau as a last resort. But do these methods work?\n\nJulian Flosbach, CEO of BFree, an ethical debt recovery company, believes they do if they consider the reasons customers default as well as their current financial situation. According to flosbach a majority of borrowers default because they lose their jobs, their business fails, or due to health emergencies that change the financial affordability of customers. He believes that assessing the new financial abilities of a customer and offering new repayments plans via convenient communication channels can then increase the repayment rates from these customers significantly.\n\nAn employee at a digital lending company explained that reporting to the credit bureau could be effective at times. She cited a case of a defaulting debtor whose application visa was denied because he failed to repay his loan for over a year. Credit checks are a prerequisite for issuing visas in some countries.\n\nShe also affirms Sodipo\u2019s point about an influx of lenders with lax rules by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s typically companies not registered with the credit bureau that use unethical debt collection practices.\u201d\n\nSlow and steady doesn\u2019t win this race\n\nIt\u2019s clear that digital lenders involved in unethical debt collection practices do so because of their unchecked ambition and the convenience of operating outside the law.\n\nFortunately, a number of governing bodies are beginning to do something about these digital lenders.

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Crypto made it to AFCON! Aren\u2019t African governments wary?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day\n\nOluwanifemi, here\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCrypto at AFCON\n\nTouch and Pay (TAP)\u2019s Cowry card\n\nCrypto ads at AFCON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Sky Sports\n\nThe African Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2022 kicked off on Sunday, January 9, in Cameroon. Although there have been multiple postponements, anticipation didn\u2019t quite wane. So far, four matches have been played, and many more are to come before the finale on February 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about sports, but I\u2019ve grown a liking for football, and I\u2019ve been conveniently drawn to foreign leagues, especially the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. Following the buzz around AFCON, I asked Emmanuel Paul if players were on an international break. \u201cApparently not,\u201d he replied.\n\nAfrica is a great exporter of talents, and this includes football. This means some foreign clubs would have to miss their players for some weeks. Well, my real worry was Chelsea having Kepa Arrizabalaga man the nets for its upcoming major matches\ud83d\ude10, instead of Mendy, who is off to make Senegal proud. Anyways, the entire situation was surprising since AFCON is one of the world\u2019s major continental tournaments, like Euros and Copa America.\n\nWant to know something even more surprising? Binance is a major sponsor for AFCON. Before expressing my main concern, I also found that Nigerian-founded payments startup, Flutterwave partnered with Afrosport TV, the cable channel that acquired AFCON broadcast rights. Cool, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSo, back to Binance. Getting the global crypto-trading platform on AFCON basically translates to legitimately allowing millions of Africans to see crypto ads on every matchday. The terms of the partnership involve having Binance adverts placed on the perimeter boards on all the stadiums hosting AFCON matches. 52 live matches!\n\nOh, the irony. I hope we\u2019re not quick to forget the hostility of African central banks and regulatory agencies toward digital currencies. One that readily comes to mind is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricting cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Despite all that, Africa still tops the chart regarding peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platforms in terms of transaction volume globally. Source? 2020 and 2021 stats.\n\nRecall? Nigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions\n\nIt might not be convenient to argue that the football governing body for Africa, the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF), isn\u2019t aware of this apathy. Does this further confirm the suspicion that African governments, like many other countries, are comfortable with leaving the cryptocurrency sector unregulated only to clamp down on it occasionally?\n\nIt\u2019s not new. Between 2018 and now, more cryptocurrency and blockchain companies have gotten into sports worldwide. A crypto-trading platform, eToro is one of Europe\u2019s biggest football sponsors. Clubs like Tottenham Hotspur FC, Brighton & Hove Albion FC, Cardiff City FC, Crystal Palace FC, Leicester City FC, Newcastle United FC, and Southampton FC make the list. In fact, in 2021, Binance became the main jersey sponsor for S.S. Lazio, an Italian football club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto.com sponsored the US Superbowl for $700 million, and FTX has shelled out almost $150 million for the NBA\u2019s Miami Heat.\n\nBolu, our reporter covering cryptocurrency and blockchain, can enlighten you, our esteemed readers, about crypto use cases in sports. Only if you ask. Leave your request in the comment section.\n\nWhether this was an oversight or the sports body chose to look away from the hostility instead of losing investor funds, it seems sports is playing a good role here in supporting digital currencies in Africa. Well\u2026\n\nCashless bus rides with Cowry card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying for bus fares with TAP\u2019s Cowry card\n\nHave you ever thought about paying for your bus fare with a bank card or transferring money to your bus conductor?\n\nWell, if you\u2019ve lived in Lagos for long enough, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s something that might never happen. Conductors like speed; they want transactions to be done on time and will even ask you to \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t have change or worse, you forget your wallet at home? Scenarios like this propelled Micheal Oluwole and Olamide Afolabi to start the company, Touch and Pay (TAP).\n\nTAP is the company behind the Cowry cards used to pay for bus fares on BRT buses. The cards are Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled, so payment can be made with a single touch.\n\nAccording to Oluwole and Afolabi, the idea behind TAP is to create something close to cash transactions as this is the best way to digitise transactions in the informal sector where cash reigns supreme.\n\nThey spoke to Bolu about how they got the Lagos deal, their ups and downs and some of the big plans they have for the future.\n\nRead all about it here: How Touch and Pay (TAP) got 1.5 million Lagosians to adopt cashless bus rides\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nY Combinator will now invest $500,000 in accelerated companies.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a busy Thursday afternoon in one of Nigeria\u2019s busiest cities \u2014 Lagos. Three young men who needed to go from Ikotun to Agege hopped into the popular yellow buses known as Danfo.\n\nShortly after the journey began, the conductor asked for payment.\n\nThe man who was to pay their fare had no idea his wallet wasn\u2019t with him and confidently reached for it in its usual place \u2014 his back pocket \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t there. He calmly stuck his hand into the left-back pocket but withdrew it with a panicked look on his face.\n\nThat pocket, too, was empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreets of Lagos\n\nHis situation instantly became a drama; his fellow commuters, the audience, and he, the protagonist in a stage play with a bad script.\n\nThe conductor, who stood right in front of him, glared at him as he tried to come to terms with the situation.\n\nBeads of sweat had begun to appear on the young man\u2019s head. He wasn\u2019t okay. Although he knew he wouldn\u2019t find it, he searched his other pockets frantically.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten his wallet at home.\n\nResigned to his fate, he concluded that he and his friends were in trouble. When the conductor finally asked what the problem was, he asked, \u201cCan I do a transfer?\u201d\n\nThe conductor threw his head back in laughter but what followed was a very dark look.\n\nMichael Oluwole, Olamide Afolabi, and Yinka Adewale (Kudi CEO) had a similar experience, which led them \u2014 Oluwole and Afolabi \u2014 to create a digital payment system that is as seamless as cash payments.\n\nThey are the founders of Touch and Pay (TAP), creators of the contactless Cowry card used in paying bus fares. It is especially popular in Lagos, with over 1.5 million users. TAP is currently trying to replicate its success in Kaduna, Kano, Oyo, and Ogun States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoding from OAU to LAUTECH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAP Co-Founder, Olamide Afolabi and Micheal Oluwole.\n\nThe three friends wanted to own a tech company since they were in university, so they did the techiest thing they could think of \u2014 coding.\n\nFrom what Afolabi told me, coding was perhaps the coolest thing to do in university then.\n\n\u201cWe were basically tech enthusiasts. In the university, we devoted most of our time to technology. We participated in Microsoft Imagine Cups and Microsoft student ambassadors. Those were the things that reigned seven or eight years ago. To be cool in school, you just had to be a member of a tech organisation.\u201d\n\nAfolabi went to Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Osun State, Nigeria, while Oluwole and Adewale studied at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. Though Afolabi wasn\u2019t in the same school as his friends, he said they could still do things together.\n\n\u201cWe came together to participate in Microsoft Imagine Cups, and the first time we did it, we didn\u2019t even qualify. We did it the second time, and we came second, and the third time we won to represent Nigeria in Russia.\u201d\n\nThey were great at coding, and to them, that was all they needed to build a successful tech business, but after a couple of unsuccessful businesses, they quickly realised they couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\nThey came up with businesses such as Clinic Bell, a platform that helped doctors and patients secure appointments at a mutually convenient time. Still, the three went broke within a couple of months as their pocket money could not keep the business running.\n\nWhen they returned from Russia, they got into the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) and learnt that being able to code doesn\u2019t make you a good businessman.\n\nGetting the Lagos deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAP\u2019s Cowry card\n\nTAP started the process of digitising microtransactions in 2017, but it didn\u2019t start with transportation. It piloted with different sectors before realising transportation was the way to go.\n\n\u201cBetween 2017 and 2019, we ran a lot of pilots. We created wristbands for Gidi Culture Festivals; we collected the Jangali tax in Kwara. We also deployed the technology at Babcock University and LAUTECH. We even tested it with microfinance banks and thrift collectors.\n\n\u201cAnd it was at that point we realised we couldn\u2019t keep stretching ourselves. We were probably a team of eight then.\u201d\n\nThe team asked, \u201cWhich sector can we look at that will give us traction in the shortest amount of time?\u201d\n\nThe answer was transportation, and they decided to focus on digitising transactions in that sector.\n\nOluwole said the decision to focus on transportation put them in the right place at the right time. They started by working with LAGBUS, creating a revenue assurance system that helps track revenue.\n\nImpressed by their work, LAGBUS recommended them to LAGFERRY to do the same thing. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, everything was about to change for TAP.\n\nSide note: LAGBUS was created by the Lagos State Government in conjunction with a private company in 2007 and has over ten franchises. LAGFERRY, on the other hand, was established in 1983 in conjunction with Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA). LAGBUS and LAGFERRY are under a single regulator, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA).\n\nPopularly known as BRT buses, LAGBUSes are anchored at several terminals across Lagos, where passengers get tickets to board buses. However, TAP has been contracted by LAGBUS to digitise the payment system. Passengers now load their Cowry cards at terminals instead of paying with cash and getting tickets. They pay by placing the cards on the NFC-enabled devices on the buses.\n\nThe entire country was in lockdown, and governments were saddled with the daunting task of figuring out a way to open up economic activities in the safest way possible. Transportation was obviously a strong spread point for the virus.\n\nExchanging cash, handing out bus tickets, and frequent communication were ways the virus could spread, and the Lagos State Government needed a solution.\n\nAfolabi defined the solution the State wanted specifically as \u201cthe contactless system just like Oyster in the UK.\u201d\n\nA lot of companies that could provide this solution came forward. Oluwole said they came from Cyprus and several other European countries. But their solutions did not conform with the realities of Lagos. He said many of them proffered online transactions, but Internet quality in Lagos and Europe differ significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwole and Afolabi live in Lagos, and they understood that a radical change that was too different from what people were used to would not work. And with enough experience with LAGBUS and LAGFERRY, TAP was the right company for the job. The startup formed a strategic partnership with the Lagos State Government to digitise the transport system.\n\nDigitising microtransactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrotransactions are daily transactions, like paying bus fares and buying things in traffic. They\u2019re transactions done with cash because they\u2019re inexpensive and are not worth the hassle of bank transfers or card payments.\n\nAs insignificant as they might seem, microtransactions are very important to the economy. They are what keep small businesses going. These small businesses are the backbone of the Nigerian economy. According to PwC, they have contributed 48% of the national GDP in the past five years.\n\nHowever, microtransactions are still largely cash-based in Nigeria. Towards the end of 2021, naira notes in circulation rose by 4.6%, signifying a high dependence on cash.\n\nHowever, digitising daily transactions is hard. Afolabi said it is understandable to use bank transfers for rent, school fees, and other large payments, but doing the same for micropayments isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nThe founders thought the best way to digitise small payments would be through contactless cards.\n\nOluwole said, \u201cWe needed to mimic cash transactions, and one of the characteristics of cash is that it is physical. It doesn\u2019t get network issues, and you receive the value immediately. Hence the reason why we went through the contactless route.\n\n\u201cToday, contactless works both online and mostly offline. So, if I perform a transaction, it will be completed whether there is a network connection or not.\u201d\n\nAfolabi chipped in that in the informal sector, it has always been speed over accuracy, which is why cash works.\n\n\u201cAny tech that will digitise cash transitions in the informal sector has to match the speed.\u201d\n\nOther startups have tried to digitise payment for public transport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos\u2019 yellow buses. Source: Steemit\n\nThere are many problems with the public transport system in Nigeria, especially Lagos, and the easiest way to sum up these problems is through a single phrase, \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nThat phrase takes into account the ways of unruly bus conductors, uncomfortable sitting arrangements, and even the battle to secure a place for yourself in old rickety yellow buses.\n\nBut the most apparent meaning of the phrase is, only board a bus with the exact denomination of the bus fare or be prepared to give away your change.\n\nTAP isn\u2019t the first startup attempting to digitise payment on public transportation. In 2019, we featured Gona, a startup digitising bus payments with Quick Response (QR) codes.\n\nPassengers download the Gona app and scan one of the many QR codes that have been pasted in strategic points on the bus to pay their fares. However, we\u2019ve not heard much of the startup; lately, the website, getgona.com is also not functioning.\n\nInterestingly, Afolabi pointed out that TAP is also experimenting with QR codes, but they\u2019ve realised not everyone has a smartphone to scan them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment with QR code\n\nAccording to Statista, 48.12% of Nigerians use mobile Internet. It is projected that this number will hit 59.7% by 2026. Afolabi admits that the smartphone penetration in Nigeria is definitely growing, and scanning QR codes as a means of payment could be an iteration for TAP.\n\nATM cards have contactless capabilities too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nThe touch to pay technology on contactless cards is made possible by Near Field Communication technology or NFC. While NFC is just catching on as a payment method, it is not exactly a shiny new technology.\n\nIn 2006, Nokia created the first NFC-enabled mobile phone and most flagship smartphones since 2010 have NFC. Once a card or device has an NFC chip, it can exchange information with other NFC-enabled devices.\n\nMost bank cards also have this NFC chip in them. A radio wave image at the corner of an ATM card indicates it has an NFC chip. So why can\u2019t we just pay for bus rides with our bank cards?\n\nAfolabi\u2019s first answer is that bank cards still need the Internet to carry out transactions with NFC because the money has to be debited from the bank account. Where there\u2019s a network timeout or the recipient\u2019s bank isn\u2019t available, transactions will fail.\n\nOluwole explained this further with a bit of humour, asking, \u201cWould you go to the bank to complain that a \u20a6200 transaction did not go through? The current infrastructure we have today doesn\u2019t really support microtransactions,s and that\u2019s why we are creating a new framework.\u201d\n\nIt is also quite expensive for the merchant and the customer. According to Afolabi, there are charges that the card issuer (MasterCard or Visa), the bank, and the terminal provider deduct from every transaction, which is to the detriment of the merchant.\n\nAnother major reason why bank cards will not work is that \u201cwe still have so many people that don\u2019t have bank accounts.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) puts the number of Nigerians with a bank verification number (BVN) at 51.8 million as of January 2022. This leaves about 54 million Nigerian adults without a BVN.\n\nHe, however, admitted that TAP is working with some banks so users can top up their Cowry cards directly from their banks.\n\nA path to true financial inclusion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it\u2019s starting with transportation, TAP has plans to digitise the entire informal market with contactless cards and perhaps it could be a way to achieve true financial inclusion.\n\nThe founders explained that Cowry cards generate financial data about people that might not even have bank accounts.\n\nAn instance is how they\u2019ve deployed the technology in other states like Kaduna, Ogun, and Oyo. In Kaduna, for example, the Cowry card helps the government receive revenue from transport operators.\n\nOluwole pointed out that receiving the revenues via cash through a collector left out a lot of information that could be valuable to the government. The actual bus drivers or bus owners were unknown to the government even though they pay taxes regularly.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re changing that model by giving them a card which could also serve as their association ID card. They can fund this card and make their daily payments with it. The more they make these payments with the card, the more the government has access to them.\u201d\n\nPaying with the cards gives the government information about individual drivers and how much they pay tax. Giving tax returns or tax reliefs then becomes easy.\n\nBus drivers could also access insurance through the plethora of data the card payment system provides.\n\nBoth founders did not immediately admit they were positioned to solve the problem of true financial inclusion in the country when I asked them. However, they inadvertently did when they enthusiastically painted scenarios where the Cowry card could facilitate financial inclusion.\n\nOne of those scenarios is passengers getting rides on credit due to information available about their ride patterns.\n\nIt is important to note that all these could be possible without even having a bank account.\n\n\u201cThese are informal transactions, and nobody has been able to penetrate this sector. We are creating a simple platform that provides visibility into these transactions, and all of a sudden, the entire ecosystem changes and now we have data.\u201d Oluwole said.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a 2% or 5% fee on transactions. Oluwole hinted that merchants are happy to part with the fees because it doesn\u2019t only cover the transactions but the entire process of digitising a business.\n\nThe company has grown so far without raising any funds, but Communications Manager, Damilola Adebesin, said they have plans to raise in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

I\u2019ve got quite an interesting lineup for you today, including some information (probably unwarranted) about super apps.\n\nSo, today I\u2019m discussing:\n\nBFREE $1.7 million pre-Series A\n\nInstant transfers in Tanzania\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup laws\n\nBFREE raises $1.7 million pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBFREE team; Source: TechCrunch\n\nNigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE has announced a $1.7 million pre-Series A as the company looks to expand to Asia, South America, Europe, and across Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis expansion drive will see the company move into 16 countries, including Ghana, India, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Pakistan, and Indonesia.\n\nThe round saw participation from 4Di Capital, Octerra Capital, VestedWorld, Voltron Capital, Logos Ventures, and several other angel investors. This comes after the fintech\u2019s $800,000 seed raise in May 2021 and brings total disclosed funding to $2.5 million.\n\nIf you live in Nigeria or Kenya, chances are you might have received a text from a loan company debt shaming a friend, colleague, or family member. To solve issues like this and with experience working for digital lending startups, Julian Flosbach (CEO), Chukwudi Enyi (COO), and Moses Nmor (CPO) founded BFREE in 2020.\n\nCurious about BFREE? You should check out this in-depth article: How Nigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE, is helping Africans repay their loans\n\nPer TechCrunch, the company has hired two additions to the team: Konrad Pawlus (CTO) and Yohan Theatre, Head of Data Decision-Making and Financial Engineering.\n\nThe startup says it currently serves around 800,000 customers and has followed up 1.1 million defaulters to date, with Flosbach telling TechCrunch that the company looks to handle 1.4 million profiles by the end of next month.\n\nThe African funding scene is off to a good start this year, with startups in different industries already bagging significant amounts. Last year was a good one, and you can check out Chimgozirim\u2019s analysis here: African startups raised $1 million every 2 hours in 2021 \u2014 Africa: The Big Deal\n\nTanzanians to enjoy instant transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has said that it expects to roll out its new payment system, Tanzania Instant Payment System (TIPS), in February 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, what does TIPS do? This payment system would enable Tanzanians to instantly transfer money to people in their mobile contact list without searching for their phone numbers. It would also allow the interoperability of digital financial services among payment service providers to make transactions cost-effective and secure.\n\nEssentially, users of all digital payment systems, including mobile money operators like Airtel Money, Tigo, M-Pesa, and HaloPesa, will be registered under a single platform and anyone can send money by searching the name of the registered recipient in the system.\n\nUnder Tanzania\u2019s present payment system, transfers are made within two hours of the initiation of the transaction. In an increasingly digital world, this could be a roadblock for everyday use cases in markets and shops.\n\nThree years in the making: preparations for TIPS first began in June 2018 following the passing into law of the Payment Systems Act 2015, which authorised the BoT to upgrade and create new financial systems. It was to be launched in 2020 but got shelved due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter several delays, a potential date of December 2021 was given but was postponed due to upgrades being made to the system.\n\nComparing Africa\u2019s startup laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s recent history with startup acts appears promising. From the first foray by Tunisia in 2018 to the second by Senegal in 2020, countries on the continent are creating enabling environments for these disruptors.\n\nRecently, Nigeria-based technological advisory firm, Tech Hive Advisory and Africa-focused tech policy research NGO, Ikigai Innovation Initiative released a guide on African startup acts: Start-up Laws in Africa Vol. 2.\n\nThe guide highlighted and compared regulations \u2014 proposed and already existing \u2014 from six countries: Tunisia, Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Algeria.\n\nComparing the first five countries, the guide focused on the material and territorial scope of the different laws and regulations, labels and governance, incentives, and enforcement.\n\nAlthough there were several similarities, these regulations differed on several counts. For example, only Tunisia provides a paid vacation to resurrect fledgling startups, fully sponsored by the government. All five are quiet on monetary penalties.\n\nInterestingly, going by the four parameters, The Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) appears to rank highest, with Tunisia coming in a close second.\n\nHowever, I noticed that on the table, regarding sanctions like withdrawal of labels and marks, The NSB got positive marks, contradicting an earlier position in the guide which stated that there were no provisions for a withdrawal of labels and marks.\n\nThe NSB has received approval from Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council and is expected to be presented to the National Assembly by Muhammadu Buhari, the country\u2019s president.\n\nCurrently, it appears there are no publicly available copies of the bill.\n\nWe can, however, (re)read Emmanuel\u2019s Paul\u2019s analysis here: Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nI\u2019m back with my music recommendations, and this weekend, I listened to a playlist I curated myself.

          "title": "How Nigeria can get more from $1.5bn start-up funding",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem may have had 2021 as its best year with more than $1.5 billion recorded in investment, but a significant portion of that total funding did not enter into the Nigerian economy, experts say.\n\nApart from the talent that comes mostly from Nigeria, tech companies source equipment and infrastructure abroad, the two claiming a large share of the funding. Also, with the majority of the foreign investors coming from abroad, the decision for what is allocated to each segment is made from the company\u2019s headquarters, mostly abroad where the companies are incorporated.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about venture funding is that there are tight milestones attached to the money,\u201d notes a tech founder who pleaded anonymity. \u201cThis means there are agreements about what the money will be used for. However, it is a double-edged sword and if things don\u2019t go the way you planned it, it can be disastrous. This is the reason it is critical for startups to have good governance from the beginning to keep them honest and focused on the reason for raising funding.\u201d\n\nA report compiled by Maxime Bayen, senior venture builder at BFA Global, and Max Cuvellier, head of mobile for development, GSMA, shows just how busy Nigerian tech companies were in 2021. The report found that whereas fintech companies dominated the funding scene, one in every five dollars raised in 2021 was by a Nigerian fintech startup.\n\nOPay, a company that has its roots in Nigeria, took the largest slice of the funding with its record haul of $400 million. Nigeria also recorded three unicorns, Flutterwave, OPay, and Andela, the first of its kind by any African country in a calendar year.\n\nExperts attribute the record funding to five factors. The first is Nigeria\u2019s population size. It is really tough to ignore a market of 200 million people, even though the size of the middle class may be smaller relative to what is obtainable in more developed economies. The second factor is that venture capital firms will continue looking for new markets as the Western economic growth potentials flatten.\n\nMore Nigerian companies and founders getting into global accelerators, an indication of the high quality of the founders in the ecosystem, is attributed as the third factor. The fourth factor is that Nigeria\u2019s largely untapped economic potential makes it a good place to test hypotheses. It may be a tough environment to succeed in, but it also has a high mobile penetration, which is an indication of access to digital products.\n\nThe final factor is the growth of the fintech space and many fintech startups have done well to project their continental and global ambitions.\n\nNevertheless, a vast majority of the companies that received funding in 2021 have their headquarters located outside the country, despite their primary market being Nigeria and other African nations.\n\nFlutterwave (raised $170m, for example, has its main office at 1323, Columbus Avenue, San Francisco. OPay ($400m) was incorporated September 24, 2019, with a registered office at 19 Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, England, M4 4FY. Andela ($200m) sees itself as a US company with \u2018campuses\u2019 in Nigeria and other African countries. TradeDepot ($110m) is primarily located in San Francisco, CA, United States, and is part of the Computer Systems Design and Related Services Industry of that country. Kuda Bank ($80m) was primarily incorporated in 2015 in London.\n\nExperts say where a tech company is primarily incorporated is very significant for its operations. The ability to secure funding easily is one of the reasons. Foreign investors, which made up about 80 percent of the total funding raised by Nigerian companies, would have found it difficult to commit their money, especially in large sums to tech companies with primary bases in Nigeria.\n\nRead also: How 10 Nigerian startups have fared after Y Combinator funding\n\nOne reason for this is the unpredictability of macroeconomics in a country like Nigeria. For example, the country\u2019s inability to control the exchange rate is a big turn-off for many investors. Other problems like multiple taxation, poor digital infrastructure, and high inflation are some of the reasons tech companies run abroad to incorporate.\n\nQuite a number of the companies that secured funding in 2021 were incorporated in Delaware, a small mid-Atlantic US state that sits on a peninsula, for a reason. A US venture capital investor often prefers Delaware startups because of the several classes of stock that Delaware law allows. The law gives preferred stock investors of a corporation certain voting rights and control over the corporation. Many venture capitals (VCs) insist on the Delaware corporate form and will even require a startup to convert the current entity to a Delaware C Corporation before they are willing to invest.\n\nA startup registered in Delaware is taxed as a C-Corp. A c corporation (or C-corp) is a legal structure for a corporation in which the owners, or shareholders, are taxed separately from the entity. Often these Delaware corporations come with 10 million shares of common stock authorised with $0.0001 par value. Most of these corporations issue half of the shares to founders.\n\nThese corporations are seen as well-adapted to VC and angel investing over other forms of business entities.\n\nImportantly, US VC investors typically set standardised procedures for their investment activities and often require Delaware corporations for their investment targets. For instance, Y Combinator, a US seed money accelerator founded in 2005, requires that international startups they invest in are registered in the US as well as in their local countries. Y Combinator has invested in 30 Nigerian companies so far some of which include Paystack, Flutterwave, Cowrywise, Termii, and many others.\n\nAlthough many of the funders may genuinely want their funds to help develop Nigeria and the African continent, they are first businesses and want great returns. Investors also want security and peace of mind, this is why most times they insist on founders incorporating in friendly jurisdictions that would not make bad decisions, states a source in the industry.\n\nIt is equally important to note that institutional investors, some of which came into the African funding scene for the first time in 2021 are not angel investors. They are interested in the company meeting all the agreed milestones so that the next valuation is much higher and they can exit at a great position if that is the strategy. To ensure this becomes reality, many of them would take board positions, track the performance and push for growth.\n\nIn insisting startups are incorporated within their jurisdiction, the investors are trying to mitigate two risks: the risk of company failing and business environmental risks. The first kind of risk is tackled in different ways and can work out very well, just good or bad. But the business environment risks are more straightforward. Nigerian and most of Africa have bad perceptions and structural problems including poor tax structures, profit repatriation and low reputation for ease of doing business.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the government must decide to either play the good game or lose out,\u201d says a source that would not be named, to make him speak freely.\n\n\u201cThe elephant in the room is that most of the best-funded startups are headquartered in other climes. This reality will have consequences in future liquidation events.\u201d\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji, founder/managing partner of Future Africa, tells BusinessDay that the Nigerian economy benefits from talent recruitment, however, noting the risk of more of the money being spent abroad. The risk could also affect talent recruitment, where without a concerted effort to engage the universities to deliver more industry-ready talent, companies could be forced to outsource their development to other countries.\n\nAboyeji says Nigeriads to hire qualified talent at all levels. Who in the education sector is specifically delivering talent for this purpose,\u201d he asks.\n\nCompanies will also need more sophisticated financial services; especially given they have raised funding in dollars and would want to manage exchange rate risk much better. In this regard, Nigerian banks could come up with dedicated help desks for startups that have raised millions of dollars.\n\nAboyeji also notes that startups will need new kinds of real estate and infrastructure to scale.\n\n\u201cI remember the CEO of a global payments business that bought a Nigerian company recently asking over breakfast, \u2018where can I put 1000 engineers in Lagos\u2019?\u201d All of a sudden I realise that indeed there is no facility for that.\n\nIt was one of the reasons we decided to build Talent City, which is basically a city-scale infrastructure designed for tech companies and their employees to live, work, and play, he states. \u201cWe can go on and on. But the biggest determinant of whether Nigeria benefits from these funds is whether captains of industry and government wake up from their slumber, and design strategies to serve the industry properly,\u201d he says.",

          "text": "The number of Nigerian students granted sponsored-study visas to the United Kingdom (UK) has increased by 368 percent within two years to a record high of 36,783, an official data from the British government show.\n\n\u201cIn the top five nationalities, Nigerian nationals (citizens) saw the largest relative increase in sponsored study grants compared increasing by 28,923 (+368%) to a record high of 36,783, making them the third-largest nationality group in 2021,\u201d information from the UK\u2019s immigration website shows.\n\nIn terms of nationalities granted visa to the UK, the data show from September 2019 \u2013 September 2021, other countries such as Pakistan, India, China, and the United States also recorded 225 percent, 197 percent, 13 percent, and 3 percent, respectively.\n\nThe data also add that two nations \u2013 India (33%) and Nigeria (31%) \u2013 accounted for the majority (64%) of sponsored study dependents.\n\nSimilarly, in terms of visas issued, Nigeria recorded a rise of 234.7 percent to 18,580 in the first nine months of 2021 from 5,551 in the same period of 2019.\n\nThe UK, a developed economy, operates an immigration system underpinned by the principle of visa sponsorship. The sponsor for immigration purposes is the educational institution where the student will study and the visa is issued for a particular course at the institution.\n\nEarlier last year, the UK government issued a Graduate Route post-study work visa. The visa helps Bachelor and Masters Graduates to be able to live and work in the country for up to two years, while Ph.D. graduates can live and work up to three years.\n\n\u201cThe UK has been a bit more lenient in accepting general applications from Nigeria because they have realised that Nigeria has the intellectual capacity that they want and their labour is cheap,\u201d Jennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered recruitment and training consultancy, says.\n\nOyelade states that the UK\u2019s big gap in their talent leaves a lot of job vacancies that Nigerians can fill, \u201cSo, basically Nigeria is their preferred base when they are opening their borders.\u201d\n\nHigher education has always been one of the principal conduits of permanent emigration. But Nigeria\u2019s current realities such as high inflation, unemployment, and fragile economic growth have now made it a major reason why its citizens emigrate to other countries for greener pastures.\n\nRead also: Global Wissen Consult to launch blockchain programme for varsity students in Nigeria\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria\u2019s inflation stood at 15.4 percent in November 2021, and unemployment was at a record high of 33.3 percent as of the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Nigeria\u2019s surging inflation rate has increased the number of poor people to 90.1 million and that number is expected to increase by 11 million in 2022, according to the World Bank.\n\nAlso, nearly half (45%) of Nigerian adults say they plan to move to another country within five years, far the highest among 12 nations surveyed across four continents, a 2018 Pew Research Centre survey showed.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy could pay a huge economic price if it continues to lose talents to other developed nations, as labour, a critical factor of production, plays an integral part in growing and sustaining any economy.\n\nOlugbenga Ogunbode, CEO, International Education Corporation Group, notes that Nigeria is the biggest loser here because we are losing our best brains to the UK/Europe.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep our young and agile population rather than losing them to a new form of slavery,\u201d he says.\n\nSimilarly, Kemi Ogunkoya, a leadership development strategist, states that Nigeria has a lot of mid- and high-skill people leaving, which affects how businesses operate in terms of the talents that they have and their stability.\n\n\u201cThe skills leaving would drain businesses, which in the long run means those businesses will now start sourcing for talents outside of Nigeria that may be more expensive,\u201d Ogunkoya further states.",

It is a project that is dead on arrival. Because God is a universal entity that he is always interested in truth, fairness and equity. So for anybody embarking on anything that is not rooted in equity and justice will not succeed and this is a countervailing force that has sustained this world from the beginning.\n\n\u201cSo Tinubu knows that he is embarking on a cause that has no foundation in anything: foundation in equity and justice; and of course is a project that will not succeed.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze spokesmen added that, \u201cbecause there is this collective conscience that has been guiding this country. The collective conscience is to culturally determine what is right and what is wrong and to pursue the one that is right and ignore the one that is wrong.\n\n\u201cBut all the same, those who have really gone against the convention have often lost, you know at a point General Sani Abacha wanted to continue but he lost; Goodluck Jonathan ran against the current; he lost; any other person that tries to go against the convention and the current will always lose it. Mr Tinubu is working across purposes with the foundations of this country \u2013 foundation rooted in equity and justice.\n\n\u201cHe knows that this is the turn of the Igbo and instead of supporting for the Igbo to emerge for peace to reign, for the corporate existence of Nigeria to remain intact, he decided adding to the problem and crisis.\n\n\u201cSo for one to succeed as a matter of facts, patriots should consider the collective interest \u2013 the group interest more than self-interest. But in this case now Tinubu is more interested in self-interest.\n\n\u201cHe considered self-interest above group interest or corporate existence of Nigeria. And that is selfishness at its height and any country that has such people is always in problem.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze\u2019s position is that Tinubu knows that he is doing the wrong thing. He is embarking on a project that is not rooted in equity, justice and fair play, and is against the common current of the conscience of the people and to that extent he will surely lose.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nNational Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu has told President Muhammadu Buhari about his 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nTinubu said this Monday while fielding questions from State House correspondents after a meeting with Mr President in his office at the State House Abuja.\n\nHe said as a democrat, the president did not stop him from pursuing his lifelong ambition.\n\nAsked if he had informed the president of his ambition, the APC chieftain said: \u201cI will answer that with categorical yes. I\u2019ve informed the president of my intention but I have not informed Nigerians yet. I\u2019m still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. And I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people will I consult. You will soon hear, all you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You\u2019ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr President of my ambition, you don\u2019t expect more answers than that.\u201d\n\nOn why he, as a kingmaker, would want to contest, Tinubu said: \u201cAbout the cap of kingmaker, I\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless you commit murder. So, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and your story based upon your own perception.\u201d\n\nThe former lawmaker said with what he had done in Lagos as a governor, he has the capacity to rule Nigeria.\n\nHe also declined to comment on what a race for the APC ticket between him and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo would look like, saying he would not discuss any individual.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss individuals now. I must discuss myself. I have the confidence, the vision, the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr President, and turn Nigeria better. I have done that with commitment and unyielding\u2026 you know, in Lagos State. You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.\n\n\u201cYou know, the confusion, the drift of the past in PDP is being corrected. And you can\u2019t take away from that. As we are today, go back to the data on how many barrels of oil we were producing when we first came in and what it is today. We cannot even at the time we came in we did not pay the counterpart funds to start our rail line. Today, you enjoy the comfort of having rail from Lagos to Ibadan, you have the Kaduna and you have the one for Kano State on the aggressive pipeline, you see excellent infrastructure. I just came from Azare and I have seen good roads, the carnage of dying on motor vehicles is reducing except you know, lack of compliance with a lot of Nigerian drivers and VIOs. Let us think back, let us be intellectually inquisitive as to the past and the present and what the future holds for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn direct primaries and the APC national convention, the APC national leader said: \u201cFirst of all, the National Assembly and the president must be encouraged to review and review again. Whatever they come up with electoral amendment is what we must comply with. There is no unlimited elasticity in what we face, because we have to plan and plan well, and be able to manage the time effectively. The great roadmap to success is the ability of a leader to do what he must do at the right time that it should be done. So that to me, the electoral amendment point we will still look at that collectively. And it is our country. It\u2019s our democracy. We had adopted it and we will push it rigorously. It is certain that we are going to get it.\u201d\n\nOn the national convention of the ruling party, the former governor said: \u201cOh, well, I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the party. And the president is the leader of the party. So, expect convention, maybe if that\u2019s added to your own anxiety, or the other party\u2019s anxiety is good for us. We get it and we\u2019ll get it done properly.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the purpose of his visit, Tinubu said he came to see the President on general issues concerning Nigeria, including the ruling political party, security issues, the achievement and the New Year Agenda.\n\nGroups back Osinbajo\n\nIn a related development, a coalition of fifty-seven youth and student groups under the aegis of National Coalition of Youth and Students (NACOYS) have declared their support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as successor to President Buhari in 2023.\n\nThe groups said its endorsement was a part of strategies to signal a resolve that Nigerian youth cannot afford to remain indifferent to the nation\u2019s political process and its future, they have declared.\n\nThe groups disclosed this in a communiqu\u00e9 Monday in Abuja after an official meeting with officials of The Progressive Project (TPP) \u2013 the sole coordinating body for other existing and upcoming pro-Osinbajo groups across Nigeria.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 was signed by representatives of 57 organisations drawn from the North-central, North-west, South-west, North-east, South-east and South-south geo-political zones.\n\nThe youth groups include; North-central Youth Assembly of Nigeria, ECOWAS Youth Parliament, Kwara Youth Movement, Association of Northern Nigeria Students, Arewa Youth and Students Assembly (AYASA), Arewa Youth Parliament (AYP), National Youth, Progressive Front Usman Mubarak, Sir Ahmadu Bello, Youth Council of Nigeria ( ABYCN), National Association of University Students (NAUS), Nigeria Good Governance And Transparency Initiative, National Youth Awareness Group, APC National Students Vanguard, Association of Northern Yoruba Students, Arewa Youths Congress of Nigeria, Petroleum Training Institute SUG and Federal Polytechnic Offa SUG among others.\n\nAddressing newsmen in Abuja, national coordinator of the coalition, Barrister Festus Ofume, said: \u201cFor the future of Nigeria, we firmly believe that the man Yemi Osinbajo SAN, GCON is the best qualified for the office of the President, especially with his intellectual accomplishment, empathy for the younger generation, understanding of the economy and the fact that he has the experience of being an acting President and Vice President with uncompromised passion to consolidate on the achievements of the last seven years.\u201d\n\nNACOYS pledged to mobilise at least five million youth across Nigeria to support Osinbajo if he finally decides to run for the presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cBeing the most viable candidate for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, we shall, in the best of today\u2019s youth and coming generations, strive towards the election of Professor Yemi Osinbajo SAN, GCON as the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\u201cAt our enlarged meeting held at Abuja on the 10\u2033 day of January, 2022, we unanimously endorsed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON as our candidate for the top job of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the 2023 general elections; we came to this conclusion after due consultation nationwide and after a thorough assessment of all he has done over the past seven years.\n\n\u201cVice President Yemi Osinbajo is not only the best qualified among all the names being mentioned as potential aspirants; he is also the most qualified in terms of practical potentials towards redressing issues of deep concern such as the rule of law and unemployment; he has consistently demonstrated deep passion for impactful economic policies and we all know a bit about his roles in the Economic Recovery and Growth Project (ERGP) and other policies targeting macro-economic stability and restoration of economic growth,\u201d Ofume stated.\n\nThey further said: \u201cWe, members of NACOYS and other stakeholders have resolved that Yemi Osinbajo, who is a Southerner should succeed President Buhari as the tide is set for the presidency to rotate to the south; in this regard, we know that Mr. Yemi Osinbajo SAN, GCON will select his running mate from the North to balance the political equation and ensure effective representation of the North bur for the national interest and the interest of future generations.\n\n\u201cAfter scrutinising the current challenges of the country and the pertinent efforts and roles played by Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON towards containing these challenges, we are firmly confident about his capacity to address all the challenges the country is currently facing, if given the chance to serve in the capacity of Commander in Chief and the Chief Executive Officer of the country.\n\n\u201cAfter due consideration and a nationwide sampling of opinions among the youths and students across Nigeria\u2019s six geo-political zones, we came to the firm conclusion that Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON is a well-liked and highly acceptable figure to people across the country; we are in no doubt that he is best qualified to foster national unity and quench the incessant aggressive quest for self-determination and demarcation of Nigeria,\u201d the coalition stated.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 also expressed confidence in Osinbajo\u2019s capacity to lift millions of Nigerians out of poverty and create vast opportunities for millions of youth in technology-related fields.\n\n\u201cNorth won\u2019t cede presidency \u2026\u201d\n\nAlso, a former presidential aide, Alhaji Abdulrahman Sumaila Kawu, has said the North won\u2019t cede presidency to the South the through intimidation, blackmail or coercion come 2023.\n\n\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment Dr. Chris Ngige was in a media report, quoted to have said any political party that fields a northern candidate for the 2023 presidential election would lose.\n\nIn a statement by Kawu, a three-term former member of the House of Representatives said the likes of Ngige should bury their heads in shame for trying to intimidate and blackmail the North.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the North would only cede power to the Southern part of the country through negotiations, dialogue, consensus and understanding and not ranting in the media.\n\n\n\n\n\nKawu said: \u201cI think the likes of Ngige should be placed where they belong. You cannot come and try to intimidate the North in the media. Politics everywhere in the world is a game of numbers, and those that have the numbers can decide who leads them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to say without fear of contradiction that the North will not succumb to intimidation or blackmail of the likes of Ngige. The North can only cede power through peaceful negotiations and dialogue. Open confrontation will not give the South presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe one should refresh Ngige\u2019s memory. We were all in this country when Goodluck Jonathan contested and won presidential election in 2011 even when it was the turn of the North to complete the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s tenure. Did the world come to an end then? Certainly no!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, nobody should try to bamboozle us today just because of 2023 presidency. If the North wants to contest, I don\u2019t think anybody can stop it through intimidation. Let this sink in the minds of Ngige and his co-travellers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI also want to make it clear that I have a lot of respect for Ngige. I worked closely with him during the formation of APC. But I felt it was important to make things clear on the issue of 2023 presidency.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria will begin their quest at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) on Tuesday when they face Egypt in a Group D match in Garoua.\n\nThe Super Eagles, aiming for their fourth African title having last won it in 2013 in South Africa, will rekindle a rivalry dating back to the 60s against Egypt at the Estadio Roumde Adjia in the group\u2019s opening game.\n\nWhile Nigeria look to add another trophy to their cabinet, Egypt are record AFCON winners having emerged champions on seven occasions.\n\nLess than two months before the tournament, Nigeria sacked their long-time manager, Gernot Rohr, and appointed former international, Austine Eguaveon, to take charge of the team on an interim basis.\n\nAside from that, the side headed to the tournament missing star striker, Victor Osimhen. The Napoli forward was ruled out of the competition for health reasons, raising concerns about the team\u2019s attacking options.\n\nVictory, Not Personal Glory\n\nWatford\u2019s Emmanuel Dennis was also left out after his club stopped him from going to the competition. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) had accused Watford of \u201cbaring fangs\u201d over the player\u2019s absence. Defenders Leon Balogun and Shehu Abdullahi were also excused from the soccer party.\n\nHeading into the competition, the game against Egypt, the Nigerian coach admitted that while he respects them, his side is in for business.\n\n\u201cWe respect Egypt, but Nigeria is a great team, and we didn\u2019t come here to lose,\u201d Eguaveon said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for personal glory, but the most important thing I\u2019m looking for is an achievement for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe team\u2019s skipper, Musa, is also confident that Nigeria can emerge winners in the end.\n\n\u201cWe have a good team, and we are going to compete for the title with whatever it takes,\u201d the former Leicester City star said ahead of the Egypt clash.\n\nKey Men For Nigeria\n\nWhile the absence of Osimhen \u2013 the nation\u2019s top scorer in the qualification race for the competition \u2013 is a major blow for the Nigerian side, the Super Eagles can bank on the services of Union Berlin\u2019s Taiwo Awoniyi, Leicester City\u2019s Wilfred Ndidi, and Villareal\u2019s youngster, Samuel Chukwueze, to do the damage.\n\nNdidi has been a mainstay for the Foxes in the English Premier League while Awoniyi is expected to replicate his form with the German side for Nigeria.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt are making their 23rd appearance at the AFCON. In 2010, the Pharaohs won their third AFCON trophy in a row.\n\nThey have also secured a place in the playoff stage of the World Cup qualifiers. They got four wins and two draws from six Group F games.\n\nCoach Carlos Queiroz believes his boys have what it takes to win the competition in the Central African nation.\n\n\u201cWe will face a team that has many great players, but we are ready and we will face them with full force,\u201d he said.\n\nCaptain, Mohamed Salah, while re-echoing the coach\u2019s comment, said he looks forward to winning the trophy.\n\n\u201cI have never won a title with the national team and I hope this will be the first. We have a great coach and a great team so we will give our all,\u201d he added.\n\nKey Men\n\nLiverpool\u2019s Salah is arguably the man to watch out for when the Nigerian team battles Egypt. The forward is the leading scorer in the English Premier League with 16 goals.\n\nHaving lost to South Africa in the round of 16 in the last continental tournament, Queiroz\u2019s men will be relying on the former Chelsea man to set the tone for the team in their search for an eighth crown.\n\nMohamed Elneny of Arsenal is also another man to watch out for against the Super Eagles.\n\nTeam Form\n\nNigeria have only lost one of the last five games. They have won three and drawn one \u2013 the defeat against the Central African Republic (CAR) during a 2022 World Cup qualifier.\n\nOn the other hand, their opponents have lost two, drawn one, and won two games.\n\nHead To Head\n\nIn the last five encounters between the sides, Nigeria have won twice just as Egypt have defeated the Super Eagles twice. The other game ended in a draw.\n\nBoth teams last met at the AFCON in Angola 2010 with the North Africans beating Nigeria 3-1 en route to winning their seventh African crown.\n\nMatch Time\n\nNigeria\u2019s Group D AFCON fixture with Egypt will start by 5 pm (local time) on Tuesday, January 11, 2022.",

          "text": "Standard Chartered is closing about half its Nigerian branches as it moves to expand its digital banking.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter stated that the international bank took the decision as the finance industry comes under pressure from mobile money providers.\n\nThe London-listed lender\u2019s local unit already started to shut some offices in December and would eventually operate only 13 branches in the West African nation, a document seen by Bloomberg News showed, down from about 25 previously.\n\nStandard Chartered is instead strengthening mobile banking and recruiting agents to reach new customers and handle cash deposits and withdrawals across Africa\u2019s biggest economy, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they aren\u2019t authorised to speak publicly.\n\nA spokesperson for the bank declined to comment and said it would address future plans at the \u201cappropriate time.\u201d\n\nThe shift by the bank mirrors efforts by Nigerian lenders to embrace digital banking amid a fintech boom that\u2019s put much of Africa at the cutting edge of the revolution in mobile money.\n\nInstead of opening more physical branches, banks including Access Bank and First Bank of Nigeria are also curbing costs by building networks of authorised agents, or people within communities to sell their products and services.\n\nStandard Chartered has focused on corporate banking since establishing a presence in Nigeria in 1999.\n\nBut it recently looked to expand its retail base and outlined a target in 2019 to grow the number of its customers fivefold from 100,000 in about two years by using digital technology to on-board clients faster.\n\nThe lender also plans to start digital lending to process small loans quicker and increase the volume of retail credit, according to the people.\n\nWith a population of over 200 million people, of which more than a third have no access to financial services, Nigeria has seen an explosion in demand for payment solutions and lending outside traditional banking.\n\nBusinesses have been building on the rapid spread of mobile phones. Financial-technology companies have also benefited as customers sought to reduce physical contact during the pandemic.\n\nThe bank plans to close 50 per cent of its branches and reduce global office space by a third, as it seeks to save costs by permanently adopting changes to working practices and retail banking that accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn April last year, Chief Financial Officer of the bank, Andy Halford, said the emerging markets-focused lender would slash its network to 400 from 776 branches after they experienced less usage during worldwide lockdowns in 2020. At the time, the Financial Times reported that it will take a $500m charge to do so.\n\nStanChart\u2019s physical footprint has been declining over the past five years. It operated 1,068 branches across Asia, the Middle East and Africa back in 2016, but Covid-19 has hastened a trend to online and mobile banking.\n\nHalford also reiterated plans to reduce city-centre offices by a third after staff indicated they wanted to continue working flexibly.\n\nIn 2020, it signed an agreement with IWG to allow many of its 95,000 employees to work from \u201cnear-home\u201d locations rather than commuting into cities.\n\nLast November, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) granted approval in principle for Payment Service Bank (PSB) licences to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa as part of its objective of enhancing financial inclusion and the development of the payment system through a secured technology-driven environment.\n\nIt is expected that the enhanced financial inclusion would help increase access to deposit products and payment/remittance services to small businesses, low-income households and other financially excluded entities through high-volume low-value transactions in a secured technology-driven environment.\n\nRecently, the financial technology space in Nigeria has become competitive with a reported 250 companies operating in the system, according to Nairametrics.\n\nIn simple terms, financial technology aims at delivering financial services to consumers and may include internet, apps, mobile phones and other technological devices.\n\nCompanies in the fintech space offer services such as money transfer, depositing a check with a mobile phone, applying for credits, raising funds for business, among others.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",
