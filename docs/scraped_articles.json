          "text": "By Chioma Obinna\n\nAs the world marked the 2021 World Population Day, the Executive Director of UNFPA, Dr Natalia Kanem has urged governments to close the gaps created by the COVID-19 pandemic everywhere sexual and reproductive services are essentials even as it advised against reactionary policy responses that can be extremely harmful if they violate rights, health and choices.\n\nKanem in her message to mark the day themed: \u201cRights and Choices are the Answer: Whether baby boom or bust, the solution to shifting fertility rates lie in prioritising all people\u2019s reproductive health and rights\u201d, noted that despite the fact that COVID-19 has disrupted childbearing for some people, it has also disrupted the health services leaving many with unintended pregnancies.\n\nShe said the disruption by COVID-19 has provoked alarmist concern about baby boom or busts. \u201cBut the real cause for concern comes when people cannot exercise their sexual and reproductive rights and choices because of disruptions in the health services.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic may influence choices but the right to decide when and if to have family does not change.\n\n\u201cThe COVID19 pandemic has compromised health care systems particularly in the area of sexual and reproductive health.\n\nSimilarly, in a statement on its websites, it noted that the pandemic also exposed and exacerbated gender-based inequities: gender-based violence increased under lockdown, as did the risk of child marriage and female genital mutilation as programmes to abolish the harmful practices were disrupted.\n\n\u201cSignificant numbers of women left the labour force \u2013 their often low-paying jobs were eliminated or caregiving responsibilities for children learning remotely or for homebound older people increased \u2013 destabilizing their finances, not just for now but in the long run.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, many countries are expressing growing concern over changing fertility rates. Historically, alarmism over fertility rates has led to abrogations of human rights.\u201d\n\nThe agency further emphasised that women must be empowered educationally, economically and politically to exercise choice over their bodies and fertility.\n\nQuoting the WPD dashboard, UNFPA said that it took hundreds of thousands of years for the world population to grow to 1 billion \u2013 then in just another 200 years or so, it grew sevenfold.\n\nOn average 4.5 children each; by 2015, total fertility for the world had fallen to below 2.5 children per woman. Meanwhile, average global lifespans have risen, from 64.6 years in the early 1990s to 72.6 years in 2019.\n\nIt also added that the world is seeing high levels of urbanisation and accelerating migration.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "2021 UTME: JAMB threatens withdrawal of candidates\u2019 results involved in malpractice",
          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nTHE Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, has said it would not hesitate to withdraw results of candidates involved in malpractice in the just concluded Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, after thorough viewing of Close Circuit Television,CCTV cameras deployed for the examination.\n\nThis was as it disclosed that it recorded 40 cases of malpractices as well as arresting some security agents for involvement in various forms of fraud during the exercise.\n\nThe 40 cases of malpractices in this year\u2019s examination, according to the board, were against the over 4,000 recorded in the previous year.\n\nRegistrar of JAMB, Prof. Ish-aq Oloyede, made this known during an overnight visit by the Senate Committee on Basic and Secondary Education to the board\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nOloyede who presented the 2020 budget performance of the Board to the Committee, said the introduction of National Identification Number (NIN) in UTME registration successfully flushed out \u2018fake people \u2018 from the exam process as well as curtailed malpractices.\n\n\u201cThis year examination malpractice dropped radically from over 4000, 5000 to about 40 and of the 40, not less than 50% of the 40 are traceable to institutions\u2026..\n\n\u201cWhat we have this year is security agents trying to change candidates after they have been verified. After biometric verification their parents would have paid security agents they will now smuggle him out and smuggle in new person whose finger was not verified, of course the cctv cameras will pick them and that is why we are now arresting the security men, two or three have confessed that I paid N2,000, my mother paid N3,000 to smuggle in a person other than the person (registered for the exam) because they could not go through biometrics,\u201d Oloyede said.\n\nOn the alleged poor performance by candidates in this year\u2019s exam , Oloyede said UTME is not a certification exam, hence, there cannot be an issue of mass failure.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t know that in the ranking exam there is no pass or fail. You can\u2019t fail it, you are just ranking them because what qualifies candidates for university education is not UTME, what qualifies you is five O level credits so, it is assumed all of them have five O level credits. I give this example; that somebody has a wife and five children and he is going to Lagos for Sallah and he said, oh, all of you are my children, how do I choose those to go with me? Ok, I will set a test for you. The first three will go with me.\n\n\u201cThere is no pass mark. Somebody can score 9, the second can score 3, Nigerians will say 3 over 10? As if.., the exam will conduct is one chance exam. One chance exam. What that means is that anything can affect it, if you quarrel with your wife that morning it will affect your performance. In the certification exam you take more than three and there is continuous assessment. They don\u2019t know what assessment is, rather than keep quiet they will be fouling the environment with ignorance,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the results, the JAMB boss said \u201cWhen we released the last results those who are making noise are the proprietors of schools and tutorial masters because of the money they have collected from the parents and their ability in the past to cut corners and get inflated results for people.\n\n\u201d We are blocking them and thanks to the Federal Government. The introduction of NIN really helped. Many people were making noise saying the introduction of NIN will put people under pressure, that thousands would not be registered.\n\n\u201d To show the statistics, after we have finished with the old (normal registration), we opened the new one, we said everybody who had not be able to take our forms due to NIN come and register, bring a draft of N4000 so that we don\u2019t just make fake people to come around and they came.\n\n\u201cAll of them were about 36,000, who were deprived because of NIN, but the gain for the country is better than 36, 000 that were not registered because of the fake number we were having.\n\n\u201d Last year we registered 2.2 million, yes it is money for JAMB but that is not the type of money a nation needs,\u201d adding that only close to 1. 4 million candidates registered for this year\u2019s exam because of the NIN which prevented dubious registration.\n\nOloyode also revealed that plans are underway to put in place 2,500 capacity CBT centre in the present JAMB headquarters for the conduct of UTME and other exams for government agencies.\n\nVice Chairman of the Senate Committee on basic and secondary education, Akon Eyakenyi, who led the team to JAMB, expressed delight and satisfaction with the report presented by Oloyede, especially in the area of the Board\u2019s expenditure and seamless conduct of UTME.\n\nOn some of the issues raised by the Board, the committee promised to ensure an amendment of JAMB Act to prohibit regularisation of illegal admission and prescribe a minimum age that must be attained by a candidate before gaining entry into the university system.\n\nShe said : \u201cThe interaction with the registrar of JAMB today revealed a lot of truth that Nigerians don\u2019t know as it relates to conduct of special exams like the UTME. I would like to first appreciate the registrar, his management team. Indeed, today\u2019s revelation has proven that the registrar is a round peg in a round hole. He knows what it takes to run an institution like this. Most of the revelations on things we saw are not what should be exposed to the public in terms of the conduct of the exam.\n\n\u201cThe indices; what they are looking for. What the registration bodies should do, what the admission institutions should do. I want to say that they have done very very well. The progress so far, what we have seen as a committee oversighting board. We want to congratulate them for the great work they have done. If this continues, definitely the educational sector in this nation will be improved. That is what we are looking out for.\n\n\u201cJAMB serves as a bridge between the secondary and the University, if the products from the secondary school are not properly catered for and reassessed before turning them to the university, definitely we will have a problem as to the students in the university. JAMB is doing a great job in that aspect.\n\n\u201cOur own work is that of making laws, we have identified two major areas that we need to go into the process of amending the Act establishing JAMB that is the area of support that we will give, other than that, we also intend to pass on what we have seen today to the appropriate MDAs, the Federal Ministry of Education to ensure the support that JAMB needs is given to them.\u201d\n\nOther members of the committee that took part in the oversight visit include Senator Yahaya Oloriegbe, Senator Francis Ibezim, Senator Kola Balogun and Senator Stephen Odey.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

APC helped her by further denying her membership in a letter made available to the press.

You all have no idea the implications of having a brazenly partisan person as an INEC commissioner. We all did it together.\u201d\n\n@emmaikumeh,\u201dNow the Senate has rejected the nomination of Lauretta Onochie as National Commissioner for INEC. She can now go back to her ward and collect her party membership card.\u201d\n\n@judeferanmi, \u201cCivic Engagement Works. The Senate has rejected the nomination of Ms Lauretta Onochie. Lawmakers should represent the people, not one man or one party\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\n@Manlikeicey, \u201cLauretta Onochie is a well known Buhari apologist and even his former media aide but they still wanted to make her INEC commissioner, these old men don\u2019t even rate us sha. I commend the Senate for rejecting her.\u201d\n\n@Ayemojubar, \u201cIf we had kept quiet, they would have confirmed Lauretta Onochie.Hope you got the point: Put PRESSURE! Stay FOCUSED!.\u201d\n\n@buchinjere, \u201cWas Lauretta Onochie\u2019s nomination to prove to us the independence of the current Senate? Good try.\u201d\n\n@chrisrexcollins, \u201cNow that the @NGRSenate has done the much expected needful by REJECTING Lauretha Onochie can they also follow suit by passing the much desired electoral act with electronic transmission of votes.\u201d",

          "text": "Benue youths under the umbrella of Benue Youth Forum, BYF, have issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, for allegedly speaking in favour of Fulani herdsmen who wreak havoc in the state.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday by the group\u2019s president, Terrence Kuanum , the former governor of the state was accused of mocking the state government for enacting the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law.\n\nAccording to the statement, the former lawmaker also claimed that the state was free of security crises during his tenure between 1999 to 2017.\n\nThe group vowed that there would be a heavy sanction by the state council of chiefs against Senator Akume if he fails to apologize within the stipulated time.\n\nThe statement reads in full: \u201cWe watched with shock a viral video which the Hon Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume mocked the people of Benue State openly for enacting the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law and for complaining about the killing of our people by Fulani militia. Most shocking was the fact that it came from someone we are supposed to all look up to as a leader and statesman.\n\n\u201cAlso in the video, the Hon Minister brazenly lied that there were no killings in Benue during his tenure as Governor of Benue State when in reality, our people were killed by these jihadists in 2024 and he watched helplessly without doing anything to protect his people who were left to their fate at the mercy of our enemies\n\n\u201cIt is quite sad that at a time when the entire country is heading towards the ranching revolution that has come to stay in Nigeria, a son of Benue who represents the state in the Federal Executive Council as Minister is busy calling for continuation of open grazing. Akume should have known that we have gone past the era of dropping JS Tarka\u2019s name to blackmail the people of Benue in order to satisfy his own selfish interest.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani people that he so cherishes and wants to compel all Benue people to be their friends are rated the fourth most dangerous terrorist group in the world and yet the only message our Hon Minister could bring back to us as his people is to go and dine with our enemies.\n\n\u201cJust recently, his best political ally Ahmed Bola Tinubu who is the National Leader of APC expressed his strong support for the ranching revolution in Nigeria. Is Akume more APC than Tinubu?\n\n\u201cWas the Hon Minister not in the country when senior APC leaders in the South West rose up to defend their people when they were attacked by these same Fulani militia he is asking us to be their friend? The action exhibited by Yoruba leaders is what leaders and statesmen do.\n\n\u201cJust like his principal President Buhari who could only see the 1968 gazetted grazing routes as the solution to Fulani attacks in Nigeria, Minister Akume is sadly hell bent on handing over our lands to the violent nomads. But we cannot be blackmailed into allowing our enemies who have taken responsibility for the killings to be our friends.\n\n\u201cThe Benue Youth Forum frowns at the outing of the Hon Minister and has come to the conclusion that he is truly the number one enemy of the Benue people, and as the saying goes, an enemy within is more dangerous than the enemy outside.\n\n\u201cWe demand an unreserved apology from the Hon Minister to the people of Benue State within 48hrs, failure of which should attract a heavy sanction by the state council of chiefs.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept sabotage from any son or daughter of this state in the struggle to liberate our people. The objective is clear that we will protect our people with any commiserate measure of action taken against us since no one including our very own working with our enemies have sadly become moles amongst us.\n\n\u201cWith the open declaration by all southern Governors to embrace ranching, no federal government official from the south has made a comment to attack their people in the manner our own Minister Akume has done to us.\n\n\u201cWe commend Governor Samuel Ortom for standing firmly and tall in defence of our people. He is the hero of our time. We pledge our unalloyed support to him and his administration.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Benue people to be wary of our enemies who are within now that the heat is on them from Abuja to betray their people to be able to retain their loaf of bread. They are desperate traitors who have nothing to lose even if Benue is destroyed.\n\n\u201cWe commend the efforts of security forces so far and we urge them to step up surveillance to protect Benue communities against killer herdsmen to enable our people who are living in IDP camps for over three years to return to their ancestral homes safely.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should hasten to redeem its pledge that was made through The Vice President Prof Yemi Osibanjo to rebuild our destroyed communities.\n\n\u201cThe National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA should realize that the over one million displaced people living in several IDP camps in Benue are also citizens of Nigeria who also deserve to live. Adequate care should be extended to them in the same measure it is being done in the North East.\n\n\u201cFinally, we caution the Hon Minister who has received our mandate five times to serve as Governor and Senator to desist from making inflammatory statements against our state at public functions to please his pay masters\u201d.",

PRESIDENT\n\nAs a result of the recent controversy one Bello Akpoku of the Bayelsa Oil Company Limited [BOCL] was trying to create by allowing himself to be used as a pawn by Century Exploration and Production Limited [CEPL] to conjure up lies carefully constructed to misinform and mislead Bayelsans and the Ijaw Nation, we the Atala Host Community Watchdog have taken it upon ourselves to clear the air and debunk the malicious lies manufactured by the above mentioned individual.\n\n1. The Atala Marginal Field [OML 46] was awarded to BOCL on the 25th February, 2003.\n\n2. In 2010, seven [7] years after the initial award, BOCL was granted a five year extension to hopefully and finally bring the Atala Field into fullscale production. This gracious extension of the Atala Marginal license expired on the 15th of March, 2015.\n\n3. The Department of Petroleum Resources [DPR] conducted a performance evaluation of the activities in the Atala Field and its operational position and discovered that BOCL had failed to achieve production within the stipulated timeframe.\n\n4. The crystal clear inability to bring the Atala Marginal Field into production after more than ten [10] years of operating the Field was the basis of the first revocation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n5. However, it is common knowledge that the Federal Government has always bent over backwards to accommodate and assist indigenous operating companies find their feet.\n\n6. So in a bid to further support BOCL, The Honourable Minister of Petroleum Resources at the time approved the renewal of the Atala Field License for a period of 18 months with effect from 1st May, 2016.\n\n7. This approval lapsed on the 1st of December, 2017 and from an official standpoint the Atala Field license awarded to BOCL had expired.\n\n8. DPR in its renewal letter, clearly stated that \u201cthis renewal shall be the final chance for you to bring the field into production failing which the field shall be withdrawn without any further recourse to you\u201d.\n\nSo the Federal Government gave BOCL ample time even after the Atala License had officially expired in 2017, to develop the field. However, by Century\u2019s own admission in its letter of 3rd October, 2019 to DPR, the persistent non-alignment of BOCL and Century Exploration and Production, caused total stagnation of activities in Atala, the resultant effect which was the eventual revocation of the Field.\n\nThank you Mr. President once again for revoking the Atala Field and giving it to a company that is ready to finally produce the field in a businesslike fashion. You have shown great concern for Bayelsans.\n\nBayelsa Host Communities Watchdogs\n\nDubaowei Jacob \u2013 spokesman",

          "text": "The Prize Hunt promotion started on 1xBet in March and had its second and final draw on the 13th of June. During the months it was active, this promo awarded many rewards to players that took part in it. That was the case for three lucky Nigerian 1xBet customers that won in the final Prize Hunt draw.\n\nOne player walked away with a brand-new Samsung TV, while two other participants won a Samsung A71 smartphone each. The list of rewards continues with no less than six 1xBet customers that received bonus points. With nine winners in total, there were plenty of reasons to celebrate, take pictures, and enjoy the event.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUbong Effiong Okon, the Full HD Samsung 5 Series TV winner, lives in Itu and was a 1xBet member for a short while before taking part in the Prize Hunt promo. He placed several bets for the promotion, winning some of them. Even though he didn\u2019t win in the first draw of the promotion, he kept trying and ended up winning the Samsung TV.\n\nWhen 1xBet called to announce the prize he won, Ubong couldn\u2019t believe it. However, the shock quickly turned into pure happiness as he realized everything is real, and he\u2019s going to pick up his prize. He said he\u2019ll put the new TV to good use, watching sport matches and his favourite TV shows. Ubong\u2019s message to other Nigerians is not to hesitate and take part in 1xBet promotions, as one can never know when luck strikes.\n\nAdeniran Adetunwase Adeyemo also won the Prize Hunt promotion on 1xBet. After placing numerous bets and winning most of them, he also added the Samsung A71 to the list of rewards received from the bookmaker. Not aware of the promotion until after the first draw took place, he decided to participate in the second one and was among lucky players. When asked about his prize, Adeniran said he will use the smartphone to have a better experience on 1xBet and to access other mobile websites of interest. Furthermore, mister Adeyemo shared some of his wisdom with other players by saying that betting is a game of luck, and if anyone is afraid to take part, it only means that person is afraid to let his luck shine.\n\nOkoye Anthony from Aba Abia state is the winner of the second Samsung A71 in the Prize Hunt promotion. He\u2019s a long-time 1xBet user, with over five hundred bets placed across time. A determined individual, Okoye, kept on placing bets after discovering the 1xBet promotion and won the smartphone without taking part in the first stage. He plans on keeping the phone for himself and use it for everyday tasks that will be easier and more enjoyable. Okoye is an example of how you need to keep trying to win since life itself is a risk, in his own words. So even if sometimes you win, and sometimes you don\u2019t, you need to keep trying to achieve your goals.\n\nThe list of winners also included six 1xBet customers that received bonus points for their participation in the Prize Hunt promotion. The draw from the 13th of June made nine more players happy, and the bookmaker plans to continue offering multiple winning chances to all its members. So make sure to follow 1xBet and take part in their upcoming promotions to be one of the winners as well!",

He said though there were some journalists and media platforms acting irresponsibly, the place of free speech and free media in deepening democracy cannot be vitiated.\n\nThe governor said he was standing solidly with media practitioners in the fight against moves to gag the press through the new bill at the House of Representatives\n\n\u201cFree press is a critical attribute of any democracy, especially any democracy that wants to be consolidated. The press can annoy those of us in government, no question about that, but the role of the press is not to hug us; it is not to make us feel good, it is to make society better and to hold our feet, sometimes irreverently and sometimes in what I will call in a constructive manner.\u201d\n\nOn the proposed media law, Fayemi said: \u201cWe are in a democracy, we can\u2019t say they shouldn\u2019t put up opposition as far as the law is concerned but they must also provide opportunities via public hearing for the media and associated institutions to hear their views on this and to also lobby other people who may be necessarily interested in what is going on. We have seen all the front page of all the newspapers today (yesterday), and it is clear that this is an issue of concern which all lovers of freedom of expression and liberty must line up behind to support.\u201d\n\nThe governor hailed The Sun for always being on the side of the truth, acknowledging the impact of the newspaper on national discourse.\n\n\u201cThe Sun has, in fairness, been positive with the coverage of Ekiti State . On the developmental strides in the state you have always been in the forefront of the coverage. The Sun newspaper has always been a critical vehicle that one cannot ignore. So if The Sun notices what we have been doing, we are elated and charged to do better.\u201d\n\nUkeh commended the governor for recording strings of achievements both as governor and chairman of NGF. The visit also featured the presentation of certificate of award as The Sun Political Icon for 2019. The award was to be presented to the governor last year but COVID-19 lockdown prevented it.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

On the marginalisation of the North Central, Bolaji said Bauchi State in North East has more heads of federal parastatals than the entire North Central states, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) .\n\n\u201cWe are out to make sure that the North Central is not shortchanged in the Nigerian project. We hold this country; without the North Central there\u2019s no Nigeria. We have not been given our rightful place. In fact, since Nigeria returned to democracy, North Central has had more votes during general elections than the South West but they make more noise about it. Our region is the food basket of the nation.\u201d\n\nBolaji alleged that those agitating for the president to come to the South were dividing the country and should stop the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe stand for competence. Since 1999, the South has had more years in office as president than the North. We should stop dividing this country. We should jettison this idea of zoning. Even within the geographical North, the North Central is being shortchanged. The constitution doesn\u2019t recognise zoning of the position of the president. We have the support of our governors. This group was created to fight for the region.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in what southern governors said that the presidency must come to the South. They\u2019re just heating up the policy. Nigeria as a country needs the right person to manage this country irrespective of where the person comes from.

The team would be led by the National Legal Adviser of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Joseph Obinamma Ojobu. He would be joined by selected eminent Igbo leaders.\n\nSpeaking on the matter, Malami said inherent in the position of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo was the demonstration of their recognition of belonging to Nigeria and succumbing to the rule of law while maintaining their stance that they were not averse to trial of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nA statement by the Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations to the AGF, Dr. Umar Gwandu further stated: \u201cIn a similar vein, the group showed a mature departure from mindset of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra when Ohanaeze said they \u201cdo not support the use of any form of violence\u201d while channeling concerns and presenting demands.\n\n\u201cBy urging the youths to be law-abiding and sheath their sword as well as asking them to try to obtain voter\u2019s card to enable them contribute to national development, the position of Ohanaeze becomes glaringly constitutional and commendable.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Cartel marks Nigeria\u2019s 50th membership anniversary\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe federal government yesterday pledged its renewed commitment to full compliance with the country\u2019s crude oil production quota, which it pegged at 1.554 million barrels per day in June.\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, said during a briefing in Abuja to mark the country\u2019s 50th anniversary as a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), that rationing production was the right thing to do at the moment.\n\nThe minister stated that apportioning quotas did not hurt the country\u2019s production, adding that if not because of the cartel\u2019s intervention, the price of crude oil would still fall below.\n\nSylva said the 1.554 million barrels per day which was allocated to Nigeria for June, excluded condensates, stressing that as of today Nigeria has fully complied without exceeding the total allocated to the country since the OPEC member countries agreed to cut production.\n\nAccording to him, although there has been a stalemate in the OPEC discussions which has now been postponed indefinitely, there is no crack in the carte.\n\nHe stated that it is the way things work in OPEC wherein every member has to agree on every issue before it can be resolved.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur OPEC quota is around 1.554 million bpd for crude oil, excluding condensates. We are complying with the OPEC cuts and it really doesn\u2019t hurt us because the danger is that with non-compliance, prices can go the other way round and everything you are producing will fetch you less money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do and whenever OPEC gives us our quota, we do everything to achieve it. Right now, we are completely compliant with the total that has been allocated to us as Nigeria.\u201d\n\nChronicling Nigeria\u2019s participation in OPEC in the last 50 years, Sylva stated that the relationship between Nigeria and the oil producers\u2019 group has been of mutual benefits to both parties.\n\nOn the one hand, he said OPEC had supported the growth of the oil industry in Nigeria through the harmonisation and adoption of policies among its member countries, as well as through the sharing of knowledge and technical expertise.\n\nNigeria has also contributed enormously to the survival of the OPEC through turbulent times, by supporting the efforts of the organisation to balance and stabilise the oil market.\n\nOver the past 50 years, he stated that Nigeria has produced six presidents of the OPEC Conference, including Shettima Ali Monguno (1972/73), Mallam Yahaya Dikko (1982/83), Dr. Rilwanu Lukman (1986/1989 & 2002), Prof. Jibril Aminu (1991), Dr. Edmund Daukoru (2006) and Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu (2015).\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians have in total, presided over 26 OPEC ministerial conferences held in many countries, including President Muhammadu Buhari, who also served as head of Nigeria\u2019s delegation to OPEC from 1976-1978.\n\nSylva added that Nigeria has also produced four OPEC Secretaries-General, including Chief M.O. Feyide, Lukman, Daukoru and the incumbent, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo.\n\n\u201cThis amounts to a total of 15 years of managing the affairs of the OPEC secretariat on behalf of all its members. Nigeria has therefore played a vital role in the evolution of the secretariat and the development of the organisation,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a member of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) , Sylva stated that Nigeria served as special envoy to some African participating countries earlier this year in order to bolster commitment to the agreements.\n\nThe minister added that oil will continue to be an important component of the energy mix into the foreseeable future and will continue to power the global economic growth in order to eradicate poverty, which is still prevalent worldwide.\n\nThe occasion also marked the launch of the book, \u201cNigeria and OPEC: 50 years of partnership, 1971-2021\u201d, which is an updated version of the one published in 2006 to mark the 35 anniversary.\n\nEarlier, Barkindo, in a statement, had said that over the course of the five decades, the unique relationship between OPEC and Nigeria had positive effects for both parties.\n\nHe said both OPEC and Nigeria had repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to the universal values of international cooperation, dialogue, sustainable development and working towards the common good.\n\nHe lauded Buhari, whom he said is the only serving head of state who worked as a head of OPEC delegation earlier in his career from May 1976 to September 1978.\n\nBarkindo added that Nigeria has consistently regarded as one of the most admired and respected members of the OPEC, particularly in consensus-building.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Plaintiffs seek order for new election within three months\n\n* PDP files joinder application\n\nAlex Enumah\n\nThe Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja has fixed July 16 for the hearing of a suit, which kick-started the legal battle by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to unseat the Governor of Zamfara State, Hon. Bello Matawalle, for defecting to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe suit, filed in the names of two PDP members from Zamfara State, Sani Ahmed and Abubakar Muhammed, is seeking to oust the governor for dumping the PDP.\n\nThe duo, in the suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/489/2021 is contending that in view of an earlier judgment of the Supreme Court that the APC had no candidates in the 2019 governorship election in Zamfara State, having not conducted valid primaries, it would be unlawful for Matawalle to retain his office while defecting from the PDP to the APC, and thereby transfer PDP\u2019s victory to the APC.\n\nThe plaintiffs want the court to, among others, declare that Matawalle must resign from his office before his defection to allow the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a fresh election, within three months, for the PDP to replace him.\n\nThe governor, two weeks ago, had defected from the PDP, which brought him to power to the ruling APC, an action which the plaintiffs considered wrong, illegal and unlawful.\n\nWhen the matter was called yesterday, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN), who argued the ex-parte application, told the court that the plaintiffs have been unable to serve processes on the defendants hence the request to do so through substituted means.\n\nHe prayed for an order \u201cgranting leave to the plaintiffs/applicants to serve the motion on notice seeking leave to amend hearing notices and all other processes on the first and second defendants by substituted means, to with: pasting same at the Zamfara State liaison office at No: 6/7 Sangha Street, off Mississippi Street, Maitama District, Abuja or leaving it with any adult person in that office.\u201d\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo in a short ruling, granted the request as prayed and ordered service of the originating processes on Matawalle and his deputy, Alhaji Mahdi Gusau, through the national secretariat of APC in Abuja.\n\nJustice Ekwo thereafter fixed July 16 for the report of court papers on the two defendants.\n\nThe plaintiffs, who claimed to be members of the PDP in Zamfara State, want the court to among others declare that Matawalle and Gusau must resign from their offices before their defection to allow INEC to conduct a fresh election, within three months, for the PDP to replace them.\n\nFiled on June 17, 2021 before Matawalle eventually defected to the APC, the suit has as defendants: Matawalle, Gusau, APC, and INEC.\n\nAhmed in an affidavit he deposed to in support of the suit, is claiming that he suffered along with other members of the PDP in Zamfara State and that Matawalle and Gusau\u2019s defection would deprive them of the efforts they put into ensuring PDP\u2019s victory in the election.\n\nThe deponent stated that it would amount to injustice against him and other members of the PDP in Zamfara if Matawalle and Gusau, being beneficiaries of the Supreme Court judgment were allowed to defect to the APC without relinquishing their current offices.\n\n\u201cAs one of the members of PDP, who worked tirelessly and invested so much of our time and money to secure the victory of our party in the 2019 governorship election in Zamfara State, the second plaintiff and I will be highly prejudiced if the offices we worked so hard to win for PDP is transferred to APC, through the defection of the first and second defendants (Matawalle and Gusau), while they are still in the offices into which they were elected as members of and as candidates sponsored by PDP.\n\n\u201cAs indigenes of Zamfara State, who joined other indigenes of the state to give our collective mandate for the governorship of Zamfara State to PDP, the second plaintiff and I will be highly prejudiced if the mandate we gave to PDP in respect of that office is transferred unilaterally by the first and second defendants to APC, who did not participate in or sponsor any candidate in the said election,\u201d they said.\n\nThe plaintiffs want the court to declare \u201cthat the APC, which did not hold primaries for the governorship election in Zamfara State in 2019 and did not participate or sponsor a candidate in the said election cannot lawfully occupy through any of its members the office of the governor or deputy governor of Zamfara State which, by the combined effect of sections 177(c), 187(2) and 221 of the constitution, is meant for persons who are members of a political party that participated in and sponsored candidates in the election into those offices.\n\n\u201cA declaration that by the combined effect of sections 177(c), 187(2) and 221 of the constitution, the first and second defendants, which were elected into office as governor and deputy governor respectively of Zamfara State as members of, and as candidates sponsored by the PDP, cannot transfer those offices to the APC by defecting to that political party while they are still in office as governor and deputy governor of Zamfara State in view of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Appeal No. SC/377/2019 between the APC and another vs. Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa and 179 others, to the effect, that the APC did not participate in the 2019 governorship election of Zamfara State and therefore its members are not entitled to hold the office of governor or deputy governor of Zamfara State.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP in another application is seeking to be joined as an interested party in the suit.\n\nShare this:

          "title": "Obaseki: Our Actions in Interest of All Edo People",
          "text": "Adibe Emenyonu\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, yesterday clarified the position of the state government on the controversy between it and the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, over the custody of some looted Benin artefacts that Germany is planning to return to Nigeria, saying all actions taken so far were in the interest of all Edo people.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the government thus far on this issue have been driven by selfless, patriotic considerations and in the best interest of Edo State and Edo people,\u201d he said in a statement by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Osarodion Ogie, in Benin.\n\nHe committed his administration to continued engagement with the monarch to ensure that all the looted artefacts from the kingdom are returned.\n\nThe federal government has set August 2022 as the deadline for the German government to ensure full return of hundreds of artefacts looted from the Bini Kingdom in 1897.\n\nThe state government and the monarch had differed over whether the artefacts, on return, should be in the custody of a private museum as proposed by the state or returned to the palace museum, as preferred by Oba Ewuare II.\n\nObaseki had told THISDAY last Thursday that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\nBut Oba Ewuare II, at a press conference last Friday said he had agreed with the governor to house the artefacts in a palace museum and that the controversy around it was absolutely unnecessary.\n\nThe monarch had alleged that some unscrupulous people were moving to hand over the artefacts to unauthorised private entities or third parties and that it would be resisted.\n\nThe palace of His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, had asked the federal government to temporarily take custody of 1,130 stolen Bini artefacts that are about to be repatriated from Europe.\n\nThe oba\u2019s demand followed a statement issued by the Edo State Government which said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum would be built in Benin to house the artefacts upon their return.\n\nBut Obaseki yesterday said his concern about the Benin monarch\u2019s statement was that it created the impression that there was a major conflict between the interests of the state government and the palace on the matter.\n\nHe stated that his administration would not engage in \u201cdisrespectful exchanges\u201d with the monarch over stolen artefacts, adding that he will continue to seek private audience with the monarch to address his concerns.\n\nHe said the clarification became necessary because the widely publicised media statement issued by the palace had given the impression that the Edo State Government was fighting with the palace.\n\nIt explained: \u201cThe Government of Edo State and the governor have always acted transparently and in consonance with existing federal and state laws in all matters relating to the proposed return of the artefacts and monuments.\n\n\u201cThe Governor of Edo State, His Excellency, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has displayed and will continue to display immense respect for our traditional institutions and, therefore, will continue to make effort to secure a private audience with His Royal Majesty to discuss his concerns.\u201d\n\nIt said the governor had ordered that no one, either in government or acting independently, should engage in disrespectful exchanges and/or altercation with the palace.\n\n\u201cGovernor Obaseki, meanwhile, expresses his gratitude to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and other officials of the federal government for their patriotic and tireless efforts that have brought us to the verge of this eagerly anticipated achievement which has remained elusive for over a century.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking and congratulating the federal government, the president, the minister, the royal palace of the Oba of Benin and all stakeholders who have contributed to the successes so far recorded in this endeavour, the governor assures that he will continue to work assiduously with all local and international stakeholders for the eventual and final return of these valued records of our great and glorious heritage back to Benin City for the benefit of all Edo people, Nigerians and the black race,\u201d it added.\n\nTHISDAY had reported exclusively that except a compromise was reached, the Oba of Benin and Obaseki, were heading for a showdown over the impending return by Germany and the United Kingdom of artefacts stolen from the palace in 1897 during a raid by the colonial invaders.\n\nWhile the monarch favours the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or in the alternative, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the palace believes the governor prefers a private trust to take custody of, and manage the artefacts.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), says there is a surge in the number of COVID-19 deaths around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing on Monday, Ghebreyesus said the number of COVID-19 cases has also been on the increase for four consecutive weeks.\n\nHe said the surge followed the spread of the Delta variant of the virus, which according to him, has now been detected in over 104 countries.\n\nThe Delta variant is known as B.1.617.2. It was first identified in India and is said to be more contagious than the UK (B.1.1.7) variant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Thursday confirmed the index case of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLast week marked the fourth consecutive week of increasing cases of COVID-19 globally, with increases recorded in all but one of WHO\u2019s six regions. And after 10 weeks of declines, deaths are increasing again,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in cases and deaths. Delta is now in more than 104 countries and we expect it to soon be the dominant COVID-19 strain circulating worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot everywhere is taking the same hit though, we\u2019re in the midst of a growing two-track pandemic where the haves and have-nots within and between countries are increasingly divergent.\n\n\u201cIn places with high vaccination coverage, Delta is spreading quickly; especially infecting unprotected and vulnerable people and steadily putting pressure back on health systems.\n\n\u201cIn countries with low vaccine coverage, the situation is particularly bad. Even countries that successfully managed to ward off the early waves of the virus, through public health measures alone, are now in the midst of devastating outbreaks.\n\nHe asked wealthy countries to bridge the COVID-19 vaccine distribution gap, especially in low and middle income countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe global gap in vaccine supply is hugely uneven and inequitable. Over the weekend, the G20 finance ministers recognized the importance of funding the ACT Accelerator so that the world can ensure tests, treatments and vaccines are distributed equitably and I hope this translates quickly to filling the $16 billion funding gap,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe world should battle together to put out this pandemic inferno everywhere. The global gap in vaccine supply is hugely uneven and inequitable.\n\n\u201cThe priority now must be to vaccinate those who have received no doses and protection.\u201d",

          "text": "Tedros Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), says there is a surge in the number of COVID-19 deaths around the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing on Monday, Ghebreyesus said the number of COVID-19 cases has also been on the increase for four consecutive weeks.\n\nHe said the surge followed the spread of the Delta variant of the virus, which according to him, has now been detected in over 104 countries.\n\nThe Delta variant is known as B.1.617.2. It was first identified in India and is said to be more contagious than the UK (B.1.1.7) variant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Thursday confirmed the index case of the Delta variant of the coronavirus in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLast week marked the fourth consecutive week of increasing cases of COVID-19 globally, with increases recorded in all but one of WHO\u2019s six regions. And after 10 weeks of declines, deaths are increasing again,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant is ripping around the world at a scorching pace, driving a new spike in cases and deaths. Delta is now in more than 104 countries and we expect it to soon be the dominant COVID-19 strain circulating worldwide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNot everywhere is taking the same hit though, we\u2019re in the midst of a growing two-track pandemic where the haves and have-nots within and between countries are increasingly divergent.\n\n\u201cIn places with high vaccination coverage, Delta is spreading quickly; especially infecting unprotected and vulnerable people and steadily putting pressure back on health systems.\n\n\u201cIn countries with low vaccine coverage, the situation is particularly bad. Even countries that successfully managed to ward off the early waves of the virus, through public health measures alone, are now in the midst of devastating outbreaks.\n\nHe asked wealthy countries to bridge the COVID-19 vaccine distribution gap, especially in low and middle income countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe global gap in vaccine supply is hugely uneven and inequitable. Over the weekend, the G20 finance ministers recognized the importance of funding the ACT Accelerator so that the world can ensure tests, treatments and vaccines are distributed equitably and I hope this translates quickly to filling the $16 billion funding gap,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe world should battle together to put out this pandemic inferno everywhere. The global gap in vaccine supply is hugely uneven and inequitable.\n\n\u201cThe priority now must be to vaccinate those who have received no doses and protection.\u201d",

          "title": "Mobile money operators can issue cards but not loans or insurance, CBN says",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s apex bank has moved to improve the public\u2019s access to mobile money services in Nigeria.\n\nReleased on the 9th of July, the Central Bank of Nigeria uploaded its Framework and Guidelines for Mobile Money Services to its website. The 40-page regulatory framework aims to help Nigerians access financial services and products through mobile money.\n\nIn Ghana, mobile money services are widely used because they provide unconventional services, such as inter-bank transfers to their customers. In Nigeria, they are popular because banks are hard to access in rural areas.\n\nGoing forward, services like First Bank\u2019s Firstmonie, Kudi Mobile, and MTN\u2019s MoMo will be bound by the objectives of the framework which include promoting the safety of mobile money services, reduction of cash dominance in the economy, and providing an enabling environment for the adoption of mobile money services in the country.\n\nFinancial Inclusion for the Unbanked\n\nAs of 2020, at least 55% of the Nigerian population still remains unbanked according to the Access to Financial Services in Nigeria Report. While the highest contributing factor to this remains low income, the next on the list is lack of access to banking services as 44% of the unbanked population live in rural areas.\n\nImage Source: EFInA Access to Financial Services in Nigeria Survey 2020\n\nAbout 70 million Nigerians live in rural areas where banks are too far from where people live or work. At least two-thirds of the number is part of the unbanked, a small percentage of whom use informal methods of banking systems such as saving groups or co-operatives. The rest, which forms the majority, do not use these banking services, whether formal or informal.\n\nOf the 1.2 billion Mobile Money accounts that exist globally, West Africa contributes a significant 192 million accounts to the number with at least 15.3 million Nigerians contributing to the number.\n\nCBN seems to be prioritizing a significant reduction of this number by providing simplified access to mobile money services. Since 2018, the percentage of Nigerians with bank accounts has increased by 5% at least, and a lot of this is owed to the rapid increase in mobile money services.\n\nWho is concerned?\n\nThe framework regulates the activities of everyone involved in the mobile money ecosystem, from the mobile money operators to banks, telecommunications companies, agents, and consumers.\n\nIt also lists permissible and non-permissible activities under its business rules, allowing mobile money operators to create wallets and even issue cards while prohibiting them from issuing insurance or accepting foreign deposits. The most notable restriction on the Non Permissible list under Section 7.2.2 is in subsection (a) which prevents operators from granting, \u201cany form of loans, advances, and guarantees (directly or indirectly).\n\nEndowing consumers with certain rights and responsibilities, the framework provides in Section 8.5 the rights of consumers to ease of use, ease of enrollment, and accessibility to funds on completion of the transaction process.\n\nSanctions\n\nModern financial services can often be untrustworthy and this has contributed to the increasing number of unbanked individuals. From transfer errors, to debit alerts, and unresponsive customer service, there are a number of reported mishaps regarding mobile money services available online.\n\nThe new framework pushes forward consumer protection measures as well, compelling operators, in Section 18. (f), to resolve all customer complaints within forty-eight hours.\n\nWhile the framework provides a list of sanctions against operators that fail to put these measures in place, it neglects to provide details on how consumers will be compensated when a sanction is evoked.\n\nLegislation is scarcely an issue in Nigeria. When it comes to creating laws, however obscene, Nigerian lawmakers are quick to boot. Implementation remains the and one can only wonder if CBN\u2019s latest attempt will provide a reduction in the unbanked, in coming months.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Charlotte Bwana leads partnerships at Audiomack",
          "text": "In this week\u2019s edition of Centre Stage, I bring you my conversation with Charlotte Bwana\u2013 a Kenyan native who moved to Nigeria to lead Audiomack\u2019s expansion into Africa. Charlotte can be best described as a gentle soul with a fierce personality and a genuine love for Africa\u2019s music and entertainment industry.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Charlotte to Centre Stage because she has made valuable contributions to Africa\u2019s highly-acclaimed music industry. At Audiomack Africa, Charlotte leads business development and media partnerships and is responsible for connecting creators, listeners, and brands to each other.\n\nLast month, Charlotte announced her membership in the Recording Academy Member Class of 2021.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n\u201cBusiness development is not sales.\u201d\n\nIn your own words, what exactly is business development?\n\nBusiness development is not sales.\n\nIn my role, business development means identifying and developing growth opportunities that will benefit Audiomack internally and forge mutually beneficial partnerships with external parties. I come up with ideas we can implement as a business and also figure out how these ideas can benefit Audiomack and the other parties involved.\n\nWhy does business development matter in Africa\u2019s music industry?\n\nRemember that business development is about building value-adding relationships, and the entertainment industry is very people-oriented.\n\nAudiomack is in the media industry, but we are also in the entertainment industry. This means we deal with three groups of people: creators (music artists), listeners (fans), and partners (brands). Therefore to grow as a business, we must build relationships with these groups of people.\n\nBusiness development matters because it is the only way to find growth opportunities and successfully market Audiomack\u2019s creators to our listeners and prospective partner brands.\n\nWhat three professional qualities does every business development leader need on the job?\n\nCommunication skills for sure! Why? Because you are talking to different people every single day. You have to speak with your team\u2013 the team that helps you get the job done \u2014 to ensure everyone is aligned. You have to relate with external parties, such as your partners and creators. You have to develop persuasive and conversational speaking skills so you can close deals and effectively communicate timelines and deadlines.\n\nYou need business intelligence skills. Do you have insights into the market you are in? Have you figured out how to access your target audience? Have you done thorough research about your competitors? The market changes constantly; what exists today may not be around tomorrow. So it\u2019s essential to always stay plugged into your market.\n\nThe last quality is project management. Business development leaders must be exceptional project managers. You have to learn how to delegate and make sure every project has a start and end date. It\u2019s also crucial to evaluate the performance of every finished project: What was the outcome? What was the return on investment (ROI)? What did we do right? What lessons can we learn from the hiccups we experienced while we ran that project?\n\nWhat effective business development tactics can you share with us?\n\nI only have one tactic to share \u2013 I hope that\u2019s okay.\n\nBefore you walk into a room to meet with a person or an organization, take interest. Take an interest in that person, do your research and look interested in whatever that business is doing in their playing field. Before approaching a prospective brand or creator, I research their values, mission, vision, and goals. Then, I walk into every meeting prepared to listen and to be heard.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the hack?\n\nThat\u2019s the hack. Be interested.\n\nWearing two hats at the same time.\n\nYou also handle media partnerships at Audiomack. How are you able to balance both roles?\n\nCoffee! A lot of coffee. I am an expert delegator. You have a team for a reason \u2013 you cannot do it all. Once you do your part, find another team member who can handle a different moving part.\n\nI have also learned the art of saying \u201cno\u201d when I have many deliverables on my table. Honestly, there isn\u2019t a big difference between both roles. Still, I also know how to differentiate between how I function as a business development lead and a media partnership manager.\n\nWhat goes into developing a successful media partnership?\n\nI\u2019ll share two things:\n\nKnow your partner\u2019s target audience and ensure that their goals align with your business objectives. When there is alignment between both parties, a successful partnership will form quickly.\n\nEstablish what you need from that partnership. Clearly communicate growth opportunities, benefits, what you need from your partner and what you are bringing to the table.\n\nHow do you grow in your role? What do you listen to, watch or read?\n\nI listen to a lot of music, specifically different music genres coming out of Africa.\n\nEvery morning, I read business articles from local and global publications. For example, I read CNN Business, Bloomberg Businessweek, and Business Insider. In addition, I try to dedicate at least an hour and a half to discover events taking place in global business hubs.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most about your role?\n\nMeeting new people. It\u2019s always fun and exciting to meet people from different walks of life and work in exciting industries. I also get to travel a lot more and see other parts of the world through colourful lenses.\n\nI enjoy coming up with culture-shifting ideas at Audiomack. So when we made the MTN partnership happen, I was really excited that a Telco was coming onboard to make streaming music more accessible and affordable.\n\nI love that I can tell African stories from an African perspective. At Audiomack, we give creators the freedom to toot their horns through the music they create and share on our platform. We make music about our food, clothes, communities, and daily lives.\n\n\u201cAmapiano and brunch?\u201d\n\nTell us some of your favourite social media accounts.\n\nI barely spend time on social media because I get a little lost in my work. But I love Instagram because I enjoy consuming aesthetically pleasing pictures.\n\nTwitter is also my jam. You can tweet something, and someone in America or Antigua will see and find it reliable. Sometimes you find comfort in strangers online or share wild stories with your followers, and it\u2019s totally chilled. Twitter has made the world a global village, and I enjoy using it a lot.\n\nWould you instead go to a day brunch in Ghana or a Grammy listening party in L.A?\n\nPlease, my passport is ready, and Rihanna is waiting for me! I love Ghana, but Rihanna is waiting for me.\n\nWhat does being a part of the Recording Academy 2021 class mean to you?\n\nWow. This is the first time someone has asked me what the invitation means to me.\n\nFirst of all, it reflects how much work I have put into Africa\u2019s entertainment industry. Second, it\u2019s a reflection of my dedication to showcasing Africa\u2019s diverse music scene.\n\nIt also means that I get the opportunity to be a thought leader in my community and celebrate African music on a larger platform. The Grammys is the helm of music; being a member of the Recording Academy is a win for music on the continent.\n\nWhat excites you about the future of music and dance in Africa?\n\nThe entire world is on the dance floor right now, listening to African music.\n\nWhat excites me is that a generation of young people is growing up with African music as the soundtrack of their childhood.\n\nFriends, there is a lot of work to be done, but we are doing so much better.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Telecom operators are trapped in Africa\u2019s internet shutdowns: Can they fight back?",
          "text": "Eswatini ended its internet shutdown last Thursday, going by a statement from the local MTN subsidiary. Access to all social media and online platforms had been restricted in the country from June 29.\n\n\u201cAfter carefully assessing the directive, and in line with its licence conditions and the Group\u2019s digital human rights due diligence framework, MTN Eswatini implemented the directive,\u201d MTN Group said, confirming that it received an order from the Communications Commission to suspend access to internet services.\n\nThe internet ban came as the small southern African kingdom grappled with violent protests demanding the abolishment of a monarchy that has lasted more than three decades. The ban wasn\u2019t unprecedented in Africa and is typical of how the continent\u2019s authoritarians react in the face of calls for regime change.\n\nOver the past few years, several African countries have imposed some form of internet blockade or total blackout, despite the substantial economic losses they cause. But the costs go beyond just financial, given that internet shutdowns in the region are mostly imposed during protests and elections. During such blackouts, there\u2019s a high tendency that several lives will be lost, people substantially injured, and ballot boxes stolen.\n\nComplicity in compliance?\n\nThe main protagonists of internet bans in Africa are African heads of government. However, telecoms companies have also come under increased scrutiny over blackouts because they implement the orders.\n\nBeing Africa\u2019s largest mobile network provider operating in more than a third of countries on the continent, MTN has had a hand in many internet restrictions and equally faced legal battles that they have attracted.\n\nAlong with other operators, the company was taken to court in Sudan two years ago over its decision to comply with the transitional military government\u2019s orders to shut down the internet. They were accused of contributing to the ensuing human rights violations. In the most recent ban in Eswatini, MTN was one of several respondents in a court application seeking to reinstate internet services in the country.\n\nThuli Makama of the Institute for Democracy and Leadership (Ideal), the NGO that filed the lawsuit with various youth organisations in Eswatini, argued that by following the government\u2019s instructions to restrict internet access, the MTN Group was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the political crisis sweeping across the kingdom.\n\nMakama\u2019s belief is that all parties \u2013 including telecoms companies \u2013 that take part in internet shutdowns are, directly or not, contributors to human rights violations. If governments are the protagonists, then telecom firms are supporting characters.\n\nCan the industry push back?\n\nNetwork operators in Africa have been severally called on to challenge internet restriction orders instead of simply implementing government directives as they come.\n\nA research paper from the University of Pretoria identifies the private sector, particularly internet service providers, as \u201cimportant actors\u201d in curbing the common ploy by African governments.\n\nOne of the many ways telecom companies have been advised to push back against such orders is to challenge their legality in courts. But starting such a fight against African leaders, most of whom have authoritarian tendencies, may be a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d for the businesses, argues Michael Ohens, an independent digital policy expert.\n\n\u201cIdeally, they should be able to challenge the directives from African governments. Anyone can challenge anything, including government orders,\u201d he told TechCabal in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cBut the structure of every democratic constitution and the powers it confers on the executive presupposes a disposition towards the rule of law and protection of the unity of the nation, however subjective that may be.\u201d\n\nSuch provisions can be considered \u201cconstitutional loopholes or blindsides\u201d that a government can exploit, he explained. This means that the president can issue a directive to ban the internet if it is perceived as a threat to national security, whether it is true or not.\n\nOn the same grounds, the government can withdraw the licence of any telecoms operator that fails to comply with the directive. Moreover, no other reason can be good enough to overturn national security concerns in court.\n\n\u201cCourts are subject to laws and not necessarily justice hence it might be difficult to challenge a directive like this in court and win,\u201d Ohens said. \u201cSo challenging internet ban directives would be a waste of time and political suicide for telecoms businesses. The operators know this and won\u2019t try it, especially in an African nation. It\u2019s not a sound business decision.\u201d\n\nIf telecom companies can\u2019t challenge governments, who can?\n\nLegal and political organisations have not been effective at preventing internet bans in Africa nor held the main protagonists responsible to account so far.\n\nOn a few occasions, courts have played an important role in providing redress \u2013 as in the case of Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Togo. In these instances, civil society organisations like AccessNow were the main parties challenging the governments legally.\n\nAccording to Ohens, civil rights activists are better placed to push against internet bans on the grounds of human rights violations compared to network operators. This is because the latter does not have a \u201cbusiness argument\u201d against internet bans nor do the shutdowns pose a significant threat to their businesses.\n\nWhile internet shutdowns inconvenience users and are costly for small businesses that heavily rely on digital channels in their operations, they do not significantly affect telecoms firms that help impose them. Although there\u2019s a financial loss from potential data subscriptions if people could access the internet, the bulk of revenue generated by network operators comes from telephony/call services.\n\nIn Nigeria for instance, there were around 188 million mobile or SIM connections as of January. Less than two-thirds (104 million) of the regular mobile service users were internet users, per data from DataReportal.\n\n\u201cDuring internet blocks, people tend to revert to regular calls and other alternatives to data services, which means the telcos still make money,\u201d Ohens said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t actually have a business argument or concern and it is clear that the internet ban doesn\u2019t necessarily pose a notable threat to revenues. And even if it affects them in some way, nothing can be good enough to overturn national security concerns legally.\u201d\n\nMTN\u2019s statement citing \u201clicense conditions\u201d shows that telecoms companies \u2013 helpless and trapped in a battle between the state and its people \u2013 can do little against government directives ordering internet shutdown.\n\nHowever, what network operators can do is be transparent and ready to share information during incidents of internet blackouts, Ohens notes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until MTN Eswatini was taken to court that the South African Group released a statement to confirm the government\u2019s directive to block internet access. That doesn\u2019t help you,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing open and transparent from the outset helps with credibility when faced with accusations of complicity.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "The internet ban came as the small southern African kingdom grappled with violent protests demanding the abolishment of a monarchy that has lasted more than three decades.\nNetwork operators in Africa have been severally called on to challenge internet restriction orders instead of simply implementing government directives as they come.\n\u201cSo challenging internet ban directives would be a waste of time and political suicide for telecoms businesses.\nIt\u2019s not a sound business decision.\u201dIf telecom companies can\u2019t challenge governments, who can?\n\u201cSo they don\u2019t actually have a business argument or concern and it is clear that the internet ban doesn\u2019t necessarily pose a notable threat to revenues.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nM-KOPA\u2019s new management\n\nYouTube Shorts in Nigeria\n\nCrib-MD\u2019s latest acquisition\n\nKenya-based M-KOPA appoints new general manager\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nIn light of M-KOPA\u2019s expansion plans into Nigeria, the company has appointed Babajide Duroshola as its new General Manager.\n\nSurprise surprise? On the 6th of May 2019, Duroshola was appointed as the first-ever Country Director of Uganda-based bike-hailing startup, SafeBoda, when it expanded into Nigeria. Two years later, in June 2021, he stepped down from the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the connection? One might wonder how Duroshola goes from directing a bike-hailing platform to managing an asset financing platform. Well, there is a link.\n\nIn his time at the helm of affairs of Safeboda\u2019s Nigeria branch, he and his team launched a finance offering. Among other things, it enabled drivers to access credit and loan facilities via an asset financing model very similar to M-KOPA\u2019s.\n\nGiven their recent plans to foray into the Nigerian market, M-KOPA claims to have built the world\u2019s most advanced asset-financing platform. With this new appointment, plus an initial pilot test run earlier in the year, it appears their expansion into the country is underway.\n\nHowever, getting credit in Nigeria is still challenging because of inadequate creditors\u2019 rights and poor access to financial offerings in rural areas. So, questions about the distinct offering M-KOPA is bringing to the table might not be uncalled for.\n\nLater today, our reporter Victoria Fakiya will explore these questions. You don\u2019t want to miss it.\n\nNigerians can now access YouTube Shorts creative tools\n\nGoogle-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube is launching its Shorts feature in Nigeria. It will be available in Beta version to Nigerians by the 14th of July.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? As the name implies, YouTube Shorts allows users to make catchy 60-second videos on their mobile phones using creation tools like a multi-segment camera to string multiple video clips together, record with music, and control speed settings.\n\nLooks familiar, if you ask me. Since the video-sharing platform, TikTok became famous for its short videos and mobile-accessible tools, the launch of Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts seem like a means to maintain their audience\u2019s full attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouTube Shorts was first announced and launched in September 2020, only available in 26 countries. Their expansion to Nigeria is in line with a current move into the countries \u2014 over 100 \u2014 where YouTube is available.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big picture? The platform claims that this new feature aligns with its continuous commitment to help creators turn their creativity into businesses and become the next generation of media companies.\n\nHaven\u2019t missed out yet. In May, YouTube announced via a blog post a $100 million Short Funds to be distributed to Shorts content creators whose videos receive massive engagements between 2021 and 2022.\n\nWith smartphone penetration in Nigeria predicted to grow to more than 140 million by 2025, this reflects the increasing use of smartphones in the country. Top this with zero need for filming equipment, and it just might be safe to conclude that access to these tools could see a rise in the number of the country\u2019s YouTube creators.\n\nCribMD acquires Charisland Pharmaceuticals\n\nCribMD team. Source: Supplied\n\nStill in the spirit of expansion, Nigeria-based healthtech startup, CribMD, has acquired Charisland Pharmaceuticals to bolster quick access to drugs for patients.\n\nInformation released by the International Finance Corporation(IFC) revealed that only a few African countries could afford the World Health Organization\u2019s recommended healthcare annual bill of $34 to $40 per person.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this not only widens the startup\u2019s pharmaceutical network but goes a long way in deepening the reach of health care services to those in need in the country.\n\nThis article provides further details of the acquisition:\n\nNigeria\u2019s CribMD acquires Charisland Pharmaceuticals to facilitate quick drug deliveries to patients\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nHandwriting Is Better Than Typing When Learning a New Language, Study Finds.

          "text": "This post is a version of SME Clinic newsletter, a weekly newsletter that provides tips and recommendations to help you position your small business for success. Register to attend SME Clinic 2021 here.\n\nHave you ever wondered what attracts ants to honey or magnets to metal? Or in less figurative terms, paying customers to a business? If you have, then you\u2019re not alone.\n\nFactors ranging from pricing to aesthetics and sometimes certain nuances lead to a person dipping their hands into a wallet to pay for a good(s) or service(s).\n\nBut just as ants gather around honey and not gall, magnets have an affinity to metal and not wood, so is there a target audience for every business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other words, as a business owner, your offerings have an audience, and when you recognise them, it\u2019s like the satisfying sound of the correct key for a keyhole. Click!\n\nFortunately, we\u2019re in a time where people are so interconnected and can be reached more than before. But remember, not all \u201cpeople\u201d are your target market. So, how do you strategically reach the right audience, I mean \u201cyour people\u201d via social media?\n\nWhatever your preferred social media platform, the five steps below provide strategies to attract the right customers to your business.\n\n1. Put value first\n\nThe clich\u00e9 that money follows value is true. Think of value first. Step outside the ecstatic rush of those bomb ideas and plans running through your mind, and ask yourself, genuinely, \u201cwhat value am I looking to offer with this product?\u201d\n\nIn other words, why should anyone even care about your offering? I\u2019d even take it a notch higher and say if you weren\u2019t you, how will your product make a difference in your life? Faster delivery, better aesthetics to an already existing offering, fresher food?\n\nWhatever you\u2019re selling, recognising the value you\u2019re offering is so important because if your product/service doesn\u2019t seem worth a high degree of effort and earnestness to you, then you won\u2019t present it in a valuable light to the public eye.\n\n2. Make it easy for people to find you (Search Engine Optimisation)\n\nMost social media platforms have a bio space when opening your business page where you have a limited word character count to talk about your offerings. You can do this by using keywords. This can\u2019t be overstressed.\n\nInstead of merely writing \u201cfood and clothes services\u201d, Use specific terms that accurately capture the uniqueness of your brand. Doing this is key to your business popping up among the first results Google displays when people search for the service you offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Identify the people who need you\n\nNow that you\u2019ve identified the value you\u2019re offering, the next thing to do is find your people, the ones who will be willing to pay for the value you\u2019re offering.\n\nIf, as a business owner, you sell clothes and your primary target audience are pregnant women, you are probably best suited looking for them on Facebook, where there are several Moms\u2019 Pages for mothers and intending mothers.\n\nDon\u2019t just sit there. With your business name, go into these groups, answer questions, build relevance, ask intending mothers what they wish they had in comfortable clothing, interact with them, know their needs. Be genuinely interested in building relationships. Many times, the primary factor in online sales via social media is relationships; sales follow.\n\nThen introduce your product, let them know why your offering fits their needs, and remember we talked about how word-of-mouth boosts sales last week? One satisfied customer will spread the word, and that might just be the spark that sets off your forest fire.\n\nThis quote by Barbara Findlay perfectly captures the point:\n\n\u201cNo matter what goal you\u2019re reaching for, don\u2019t make sales your primary aim online. Selling repels people rather than attracts them to your business, especially on social media sites.\u201d\n\nWhat an irony! If you\u2019re looking to stay in the game for the long haul, then relationships will go a long way in deepening your reach in the long run. You can engage in and contribute to conversations happening in your field using a tool like Social Mentions.\n\n4. Ensure your content is engaging\n\nNow you\u2019ve ascertained value, you\u2019re building beneficial relationships, and your user base is steadily increasing, but it doesn\u2019t end there. You have to maintain relevance, and an excellent way to do this is to post visually engaging and relevant content.\n\nYou can go about this by posting snippets of informative content using tools like Canva or opening a blog on platforms like Medium. In the grand scheme of things, please ensure that all content stresses the importance and uniqueness of your offerings.\n\n5. Leverage online sites\n\nSeveral transactional and classified eCommerce platforms have an option for merchants to sign-up and post their products/services with their brand name.\n\nThis is one way to leverage already established online platforms to reach your unique customer base. Whether you\u2019re starting with the famous Jumia.ng or Scrader.com, you can make your offerings known to the public, easily reach more customers, and measure online growth.\n\nAnother thing to note is that given the somewhat crowded nature of these platforms, much strategic marketing is still needed.\n\nIf these all feel a tad overwhelming, then it\u2019s understandable. Interconnectedness and business growth are having a field day in this day and age. Your brand has a share in the pie too, but only in strategically applying the right tools can you fully tap into the cream of this crop.\n\nThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t miss the upcoming SME Clinic 2021, where you\u2019d get first hand proven strategies from seasoned experts to grow your business online.\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Early Bird Offer!

          "text": "Nigerian healthtech startup, CribMD has announced its acquisition of Charisland Pharmaceuticals Group to ensure fast and efficient one-hour drug deliveries to its patients across Nigeria.\n\nThe acquisition comes on the heels of CribMD\u2019s $2.6 million seed round in May 2021, which the startup says was oversubscribed. According to CribMD\u2019s CEO, Ifeanyi Ossai, users would not need to wait two days for the delivery of their medications. Now, it can be sent to their homes, offices, or hotels in as little as one hour.\n\nCharisland Pharmaceuticals Group was founded nine years ago and has a presence in major Nigerian cities. With the Group\u2019s decision to exit the Nigerian market and expand into Canada, CribMD\u2019s acquisition of the pharmaceutical chain, as opposed to building a solution in-house, will see it leverage the company\u2019s vast network of pharmacies to deliver drugs faster to their subscribers.\n\nAs part of the sale, the startup would be assimilating Charisland Pharmaceuticals Group\u2019s staff and hiring more to build out its operations.\n\nBefore the acquisition, CribMD dispensed drugs from pharmacies that they own. However, with the acquisition of Charisland, the startup is set to bank on the group\u2019s wide network of pharmacies to serve subscribers.\n\nSpeaking on the choice of Charisland Pharmaceuticals Group, Ossai reveals that the group\u2019s commitment to excellence was a decisive factor. \u201cThey are a well-respected brand in the country and have served the communities where they operate with excellence, and we are glad to pick up the next part of the race,\u201d he says.\n\nFounded in June 2020 by Ossai, Ngiri Michael, and Lorna Mae Johnson, CribMD allows patients \u2014 with a subscription plan ranging between $7 and $50 monthly \u2014 to request doctors for house calls or consultation via telemedicine.\n\nWith a presence in every Nigerian state, CribMD also offers insurance services for individuals and corporations.\n\nFollowing its $2.6 million seed raise earlier in the year, Ossai confirms to Techpoint Africa that this is the first in a series of acquisitions that the company plans to make.\n\n\u201cFast expansion and acquisitions are part of what we\u2019re using our funding to do in order to drive value for subscribers and stakeholders,\u201d Ossai explains. The World Health Organization\u2019s recommended doctor to patient ratio is 1:600, and Nigeria is a long way off at 1:2,753. With the government struggling to make up this deficit, healthtech startups have sprung up to solve the problem, and CribMD is one such solution.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Senate exposes Buhari\u2019s blunder, rejects Lauretta Onochie as INEC commissioner",
          "text": "The Personal Assistant to the President on New Media, Lauretta Onochie, cannot be a commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for now, despite President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s nomination, the Senate Commitee on INEC has said.\n\nThis is because there is currently no vacancy for Delta State (where she hails from) as a National Commissioner, Chairperson of the committee, Kabiru Gaya, who presented the report of the vetting done on Ms Onochie\u2019s nomination, said. The committee therefore recommended that the presidential aide\u2019s appointment be rejected.\n\nMr Gaya said she was disqualified based on federal character principles as there is currently a serving commissioner from Delta State, where she hails from.\n\nBy nominating Ms Onochie, the president committed another blunder in addition to his disregard for the Nigerian Constititution which forbids him from nominating partisan individuals for such a position. The president committed a similar blunder in the past when he appointed dead people to boards of federal parastatals.\n\nSection 14(1)(a&b) of the Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as amended stipulates that \u201cthe\u2026Commission (INEC) shall comprise the following members: a). a chairman, who shall be the Chief Electoral Commissioner; b). twelve other members to be known as National Electoral Commissioners.\u201d\n\nThat means that two national commissioners must be drawn from each of the country\u2019s six geopolitical zones.\n\nThat was also the part of the law the president referred to when he wrote to the Senate seeking the confirmation of the appointment of Ms Onochie and three others.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Paragraph 14 of Part I(F) of the Third Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, I hereby forward for confirmation by the Senate, the appointment of the following four Commissioners for\u2026INEC,\u201d the letter read.\n\nThe letter specifically listed the nominees as \u201cMuhammad Kallah (National Electoral Commissioner), Katsina; Lauretta Onochie (National Electoral Commissioner), Delta; Kunle Cornelius Ajayi (National Electoral Commissioner), Ekiti; and Saidu Babura Ahmad (Resident Electoral Commissioner), Jigawa.\n\nBut Ms Onochie cannot be appointed to the position at this time because there is a sitting National Electoral Commissioner, May Agbamuche-Mbu, from the same Delta State that the presidential aide hails from.\n\nNot only is Ms Agbamuche-Mbu\u2019s tenure yet to expire, she also represents the South-south region in the commission. She hails from Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State. A single state cannot produce the two national commissioners meant for a geopolitical zone.\n\nBlunder?\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s decision to appoint Ms Onochie is curious especially because Ms Agbamuche-Mbu still has over five months to serve in the Commission. As a matter of fact, the president\u2019s initial letter nominating Ms Onochie to the position came in October 2020, when Ms Agbamuche-Mbu still had over a year to the expiration of her five-year tenure.\n\nThe Senate had on November 17, 2016 confirmed Ms Agbamuche-Mbu as a National Electoral Commissioner. This means she has at least five more months in office \u2013 if she is not reappointed.\n\nThere is also nowhere in Mr Buhari\u2019s letter where he indicated to the Senate that Ms Onochie will replace Ms Agbamuche-Mbu now or later.\n\nBlunder apart, Law breached too\n\nBesides naming a nominee for an office that has no vacancy, the president also breached Section 14(2a) and 14(3b) of the Third Schedule of the Constitution which specifically declares that appointees to the electoral body must be non-partisan and also not a card-carrying member of any political party.\n\nSection 14(2a) of the Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as amended states that \u201ca member of the commission shall be non-partisan and a person of unquestionable integrity.\u201d\n\nSection 14(3b) of the same Schedule states that \u201cthere shall be for each state of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja, a Resident Electoral Commissioner who shall be a person of unquestionable integrity and shall not be a member of any political party.\u201d This, however, directly applies to members appointed as Resident Electoral Commissioners.\n\nThis completely disqualifies Ms Onochie who is not just a presidential aide but also a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). She is known to have repeatedly expressed partisan views in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe had in 2018 and 2019, campaigned for the president\u2019s second term (#NextLevel Agenda).\n\nMs Onochie was also one of the Nigerian politicians identified in a PREMIUM TIMES analysis who deployed fake news as campaign strategies online.\n\nHer nomination triggered outrage among Nigerians. Individuals and civic groups asked the president to withdraw the nomination on grounds that Ms Onochie is partisan.\n\nMany also said her appointment could jeopardise the credibility of future elections.\n\nDeafening silence\n\nThe presidency has been silent on the issue.\n\nMs Onochie\u2019s controversial nomination as INEC commissioner is not the first case of a partisan individual transmitted to the ninth Senate for appointment to the commission.\n\nRaheem Olalekan was a \u201cformer\u201d APC member nominated as a resident electoral commissioner by the president. He confessed to being a member of the APC during his screening exercise.\n\nHe also admitted that he contested for local government chairmanship in Osogbo, Osun State even though he said \u201dhe stopped being a card-carrying member of the party in 2017\u201d.\n\nHis nomination was rejected by the Senate after the chairman of the panel, Kabiru Gaya, asked his colleagues to stand down Mr Olalekan\u2019s screening because a petition had been written against him accusing him of being a card-carrying member of the APC.\n\nThe senators have now given Ms Onochie the same treatment they dished out to Mr Olalekan.",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) warned on Tuesday that with OPEC+ nations pumping less than needed prices are set to be volatile until it reaches a deal to raise output.\n\nThe warning came against the backdrop of oil demand surge recorded last month as rising vaccination rates helped underpin robust economic activities.\n\nA meeting of OPEC+ nations earlier this month was deadlocked over plans to gradually ease production cuts, imposed to reverse the plunge in oil prices at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as demand tumbled.\n\nBut demand is rebounding, with the IEA estimating it surged by an estimated 3.2 million barrels per day (mbd) last month, which is more than a third of the overall drop in demand last year.\n\nThe IEA expects oil demand to rise by another 3.3 mbd in the three months from July. That is more than twice as large as the seasonal increase registered during the same period in 2019, which the IEA said is a result of easing Covid restrictions and increasing vaccination.\n\nWhile OPEC+ had been set to gradually raise oil output, the stalemate means production is frozen at current levels until an agreement is found.\n\n\u201cOil prices reacted sharply to the OPEC+ impasse last week, eyeing the prospect of a deepening supply deficit if a deal cannot be reached,\u201d the IEA said in its latest monthly report.\n\nThe main international oil contracts have been trading around $75 per barrel, and some analysts see a spike to $100 as possible.\n\nBut there is another possibility: the overall OPEC+ deal breaks down and producers open the taps and try to gain market shares, which would likely lead to prices crashing.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the possibility of a market share battle, even if remote, is hanging over markets, as is the potential for high fuel prices to stoke inflation and damage a fragile economic recovery,\u201d said the IEA.\n\nInvestors have been worried that a surge in inflation could force central banks to raise their ultra-low interest rates, thus removing one of the main supports for the economic recovery.\n\nThe IEA said that absent increased production by OPEC+ nations the market for crude is set to tighten, with additional stocks built up during the pandemic already gone and reserves running below the long-term average in industrialised nations.\n\nFurthermore, it forecasts the biggest draw upon stocks in at least a decade will happen this quarter as OPEC+ pumps nearly 2 mbd less than market demand. The gap will rise to 3.2 mbd in the final three months of the year.\n\n\u201cOil markets are likely to remain volatile until there is clarity on OPEC+ production policy,\u201d the IEA warned.\n\nIt also noted that a spike in prices would not be in the long-term interest of oil producers.\n\n\u201cWhile prices at these levels could increase the pace of electrification of the transport sector and help accelerate energy transitions, they could also put a drag on the economic recovery, particularly in emerging and developing countries,\u201d the IEA report said.\n\nWhile the agency, which advises oil-consuming nations, foresees oil demand recovering along with the global economy, it doesn\u2019t discount the pandemic continuing to weigh upon the market.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 remains a significant threat to oil demand growth in the near- to medium-term, in particular in the non-OECD.\u201d\n\nEmerging nations not in the OECD group of advanced nations \u2014 such as China and India \u2014 were responsible for much of the growth in the global economy before the pandemic.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has argued that while he would not be part of any bill that seeks to gag the press, he noted that the press would be allowed to run amok.\n\nGbajabiamila who spoke on Monday during the annual dinner and award of excellence with the theme: \u2018Reorganising Good Governance and Legislative Excellence in the Face of Adversity,\u2019 in response to the backlash from media owners, journalists, and other stakeholders against the Nigerian Press Council (NPC) Amendment Bill sponsored by Hon. Segun Odebunmi.\n\nMany critics of the bill say it is meant to gag the press. Former Ogun State governor and ex MD of the Daily Times of Nigeria, Segun Osoba, had for instance, described the proposed amendment as draconian and worse than the infamous decree 4 promulgated by the military government of Muhammadu Buhari in 1984.\n\nResponding to the backlash, however, Gbajabiamila said he was of the strong view that there is press freedom and freedom of expression and there will always be, but that there was nowhere in the world where freedom of expression is absolute.\n\n\u201cI will not be part of any bill that will seek to gag the press. No bill will come to the floor of the House that seeks to gag the press, because the press as it is supposed to be, is supposed to be the voice of the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOnce, I will never allow the gagging of the press. I worry where at every turn when the National Assembly tries to promulgate the law with the best of intentions and everybody descends on the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cUsing this as a sample, this Press Council Bill. I called the proponent of the bill, what is going on, what have you done and he tried to break it down. I haven\u2019t read the bill personally myself but I will read it in the next couple of days in detail. I just have a general idea of the context.\n\n\u201cHe told me he had a meeting with all the stakeholders. I wasn\u2019t present at the meeting. Because I said to him, I hope you are meeting with these guys, whatever provision they have problem with, whatever provision that is inimical to the development of the press or the growth of the press, remove it or tweak it in such a way that everybody will be happy.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said from his understanding, even though he doesn\u2019t know how true it is, the issue was not about any provision, the issue was that the press does not want to be regulated at all.\n\n\u201cWe are getting to a point in this country, nobody wants to be regulated, the NGOs don\u2019t want to be regulated, the religious bodies don\u2019t want to be regulated, social media doesn\u2019t want to be regulated, professors of universities go on strike because they don\u2019t want to be on the same payment platform as everybody else,\u201d Gbajabiamila said.\n\n\u201cSo, regulations are a key component or essential component of good governance. We cannot just let people or any institution run amok. The executive is regulated, the judiciary to a large extent is regulated, the legislature is regulated. Just name it. Institutions are meant to be regulated.\n\n\u201cThere is no one institution that can be above the law, especially an institution that is meant to be the fourth estate of the realm whose utterances or writings can make it break even a government.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said as long the provisions in the bill guarantees the independence of the press, it is non-negotiable.\n\nGbajabiamila further said in the last two or three weeks, he had been inundated with the issue of Electoral Amendment about the alleged smuggled Section 59(2).\n\nHe insisted that neither himself nor members of the House Committee on Electoral Act are aware that any of the provisions as agreed on by the committee had been tampered with.\n\nHowever, speaking with THISDAY in a telephone interview yesterday, Odebunmi said the bill is at the second reading stage.\n\nThe lawmaker added that any Nigerian who thinks there\u2019s something in the bill that\u2019s not friendly should submit a memorandum on it.\n\nOdebunmi said at the moment the bill has been stepped down for further deliberations.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe little thing I can say is that we are at the public hearing, which means the bill is at the stage of the second reading where you have to engage the stakeholders. Any Nigerian who thinks there\u2019s something in the bill that\u2019s not friendly should submit memoranda.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi said the National Assembly is in the process of making a law, adding that nobody would force any law on anybody.",

          "title": "Benue Youths Give Akume 48 Hours To Apologise Over Alleged Support For Fulani Herdsmen",
          "text": "Benue youths, united under the Benue Youth Forum, have given Senator George Akume, Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, a 48-hour ultimatum for reportedly advocating in favor of Fulani herders wreaking havoc in the state.\n\nThe group\u2019s president, Terrence Kuanum, issued a statement on Tuesday accusing the former governor of insulting the state government for enacting the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law.\n\nAccording to the statement, the former lawmaker also claimed that during his term from 1999 to 2017, the state was free of security crises.\n\nSenator Akume will face a hefty censure from the state council of chiefs if he does not apologize within the time limit, according to the organization.\n\nThe statement reads in full: \u201cWe watched with shock a viral video which the Hon Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume mocked the people of Benue State openly for enacting the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law and for complaining about the killing of our people by Fulani militia. Most shocking was the fact that it came from someone we are supposed to all look up to as a leader and statesman.\n\n\u201cAlso in the video, the Hon Minister brazenly lied that there were no killings in Benue during his tenure as Governor of Benue State when in reality, our people were killed by these jihadists in 2024 and he watched helplessly without doing anything to protect his people who were left to their fate at the mercy of our enemies\n\n\u201cIt is quite sad that at a time when the entire country is heading towards the ranching revolution that has come to stay in Nigeria, a son of Benue who represents the state in the Federal Executive Council as Minister is busy calling for continuation of open grazing. Akume should have known that we have gone past the era of dropping JS Tarka\u2019s name to blackmail the people of Benue in order to satisfy his own selfish interest.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani people that he so cherishes and wants to compel all Benue people to be their friends are rated the fourth most dangerous terrorist group in the world and yet the only message our Hon Minister could bring back to us as his people is to go and dine with our enemies.\n\n\u201cJust recently, his best political ally Ahmed Bola Tinubu who is the National Leader of APC expressed his strong support for the ranching revolution in Nigeria. Is Akume more APC than Tinubu?\n\n\u201cWas the Hon Minister not in the country when senior APC leaders in the South West rose up to defend their people when they were attacked by these same Fulani militia he is asking us to be their friend? The action exhibited by Yoruba leaders is what leaders and statesmen do.\n\n\u201cJust like his principal President Buhari who could only see the 1968 gazetted grazing routes as the solution to Fulani attacks in Nigeria, Minister Akume is sadly hell bent on handing over our lands to the violent nomads. But we cannot be blackmailed into allowing our enemies who have taken responsibility for the killings to be our friends.\n\n\u201cThe Benue Youth Forum frowns at the outing of the Hon Minister and has come to the conclusion that he is truly the number one enemy of the Benue people, and as the saying goes, an enemy within is more dangerous than the enemy outside.\n\n\u201cWe demand an unreserved apology from the Hon Minister to the people of Benue State within 48hrs, failure of which should attract a heavy sanction by the state council of chiefs.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept sabotage from any son or daughter of this state in the struggle to liberate our people. The objective is clear that we will protect our people with any commiserate measure of action taken against us since no one including our very own working with our enemies have sadly become moles amongst us.\n\n\u201cWith the open declaration by all southern Governors to embrace ranching, no federal government official from the south has made a comment to attack their people in the manner our own Minister Akume has done to us.\n\n\u201cWe commend Governor Samuel Ortom for standing firmly and tall in defence of our people. He is the hero of our time. We pledge our unalloyed support to him and his administration.\n\n\u201cWe call on all Benue people to be wary of our enemies who are within now that the heat is on them from Abuja to betray their people to be able to retain their loaf of bread. They are desperate traitors who have nothing to lose even if Benue is destroyed.\n\n\u201cWe commend the efforts of security forces so far and we urge them to step up surveillance to protect Benue communities against killer herdsmen to enable our people who are living in IDP camps for over three years to return to their ancestral homes safely.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should hasten to redeem its pledge that was made through The Vice President Prof Yemi Osibanjo to rebuild our destroyed communities.\n\n\u201cThe National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA should realize that the over one million displaced people living in several IDP camps in Benue are also citizens of Nigeria who also deserve to live. Adequate care should be extended to them in the same measure it is being done in the North East.\n\n\u201cFinally, we caution the Hon Minister who has received our mandate five times to serve as Governor and Senator to desist from making inflammatory statements against our state at public functions to please his pay masters\u201d.",
