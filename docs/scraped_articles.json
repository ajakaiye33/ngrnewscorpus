          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Lagos-based Registered Dietitian-Nutritionist, Cynthia Onyekwere, has urged pregnant women to regularly consume foods rich in vitamin A, noting that doing so will help to reduce the huge burden of vitamin A deficiency in children.\n\nThe nutrition expert noted that vitamin A deficiency can lead to night blindness, poor growth in babies and also increase their susceptibility to childhood infections and even death.\n\nOnyekwere said while the World Health Organisation had employed periodic administration of vitamin A supplements as one of the strategies to tackle the problem, it was important for mothers to understand their role in tackling the problem also.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise in an interview, the nutrition expert stressed that deficiency of vitamin A in children diminishes their ability to fight infections.\n\nAccording to the WHO, night blindness (in which it is difficult or impossible to see in relatively low light) is one of the clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency, adding that it is common during pregnancy in developing countries.\n\n\u201cNight blindness is one of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency. In its more severe forms, vitamin A deficiency contributes to blindness by making the cornea very dry, thus damaging the retina and cornea.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 250 000\u2013500 000 children who are vitamin A-deficient become blind every year, and half of them die within 12 months of losing their sight.\n\n\u201cDeficiency of vitamin A is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from common childhood infections and is the world\u2019s leading preventable cause of childhood blindness.\n\n\u201cVitamin A deficiency also contributes to maternal mortality and other poor outcomes of pregnancy and lactation,\u201d WHO says.\n\nThe dietician urged pregnant women to improve their dietary intake of vitamin A-rich foods, warning that its deficiency impacts the growth and development of the child.\n\nOnyekwere said, \u201cVitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin, is required by children for growth, vision, and strengthening of the immune system.\n\n\u201cThe deficiency of vitamin A can lead to night blindness, poor growth, increased susceptibility to childhood infections, and even death.\n\n\u201cInfants and children under five years, especially those in developing countries, are at increased risk of vitamin A deficiency for a number of reasons, such as increased physiological needs, poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy, poor breastfeeding practices, and inadequate dietary intake of vitamin A-rich foods.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund says vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness and increases the risk of death from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea.\n\nUNICEF had, in a 2018 report titled, \u201cCoverage at a crossroads,\u2019 warned that more than 140 million children are at greater risk of illness, hearing loss, blindness and even death globally if urgent action is not taken to provide them with life-saving vitamin A supplements.\n\nOnyekwere stressed that improved maternal nutrition during pregnancy would help support efforts to reduce child mortality.\n\n\u201cHowever, nutrition-wise, some measures can be adopted to reduce the burden of vitamin A deficiency.\n\n\u201cFirst, a mother should eat an adequate diet during pregnancy and lactation.\n\n\u201cSecond, upon delivery, the medical team should ensure that the newborn is fed with colostrum as it is rich in vitamin A.\n\n\u201cThird, lactating mothers should be encouraged to embrace exclusive breastfeeding.

          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA professor of Fetomaternal health, Prof. Bako Babagana, has said that the removal of a woman\u2019s womb is the only cure for adenomyosis.\n\nAdenomyosis, according to experts, is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (the endometrium) breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.\n\nThe condition often occurs late in the childbearing years and typically disappears after menopause. It may cause heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, severe cramping, pain during intercourse, or blood clots that pass during a period, experts say.\n\nAccording to Babagana, hysterectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the womb (uterus) is the best treatment for adenomyosis because science is yet to come up with a cure for the condition.\n\nThe health expert urged women to pay attention to symptoms like pains during menses, lower abdominal pains, and excessive menstruation, noting that they could be signs of adenomyosis. Other symptoms of the condition. he said, are inability to get pregnant and abdominal swelling.\n\nBabagana said while the condition remains a puzzle for science and medicine, it has been established that it affects more women who have had repeated childbirths.\n\nRecall that popular Nigerian actress, Nse Ikpe-Etim, had earlier this month during an interview stated that she couldn\u2019t bear children following the removal of her womb.\n\nThe screen diva had earlier revealed how she was unable to conceive following the removal of her womb due to adenomyosis.\n\nSpeaking on how her inability to conceive had made her feel in the recent interview, Nse Ikpe-Etim said she felt inadequate but not ashamed.\n\n\u201cI felt inadequate as a woman but I\u2019m not ashamed. That\u2019s the least that I would be because I can\u2019t be ashamed.\n\n\u201cIt was tied to how I was brought up. We don\u2019t tie shame to ourselves. We live through life fully,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Mayo Clinic \u2013 a medical center focused on integrated health care, education, and research, adenomyosis occurs when the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.\n\nThe displaced tissue, Mayo Clinic explained, continues to act normally \u2014 thickening, breaking down, and bleeding \u2014 during each menstrual cycle.\n\nSpeaking further with PUNCH HealthWise, Babagana said undergoing a hysterectomy to remove the womb is the only cure for the condition, noting that using drugs for treatment is of little benefit.\n\n\u201cThe response of women that have adenomyosis to drugs is not as good as that of fibroid but you can still use those drugs to suppress its occurrence but the response is not that very good,\u201d he said.\n\nBabagana explained that adenomyosis is the exact opposite of fibroid in presentation.\n\n\u201cThe characteristics are the exact opposite of fibroid. For example, when a fibroid grows bigger causing the woman to have a large womb with swelling that you may need to remove, the adenomyosis will make the womb to be big without a specific site that contains something like a big fibroid.\n\n\u201cWhile fibroids are usually solitary because they are things that are so different from the walls of the womb so you can remove them comfortably but unfortunately in adenomyosis, it is not so. It is a bit different; it is not so different from the wall of the womb so it is not easy to remove.\u201d\n\nAccording to My Cleveland Clinic, a non-profit academic medical centre, there are between 20 to 65 per cent of women who have adenomyosis, noting that some of those affected may not even be aware they have the condition.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

The case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja but attempts to arraign Senator Okorocha was stalled twice owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes.\n\n\u201cNigeria has been corrupted to the extent that people jumped bail at will. It is wrong of Rochas Okorocha to tie his arrest and predicaments to an effort at truncating his presidential ambition as he had been making people believe. If his hands are clean, why dishonour EFCC\u2019s invitation? This is a man who wants to preside over the affairs of this country, yet he found it difficult to obey the law of the land by jumping bail and evading arrest.\n\n\u201cIn as much as we want to condemn the Gestapo nature of the siege and his eventual arrest, we want to be on the side of caution to reiterate that we fully support his arrest, interrogation and prosecution if found wanton.\n\n\u201cEFCC could have been more patient till Okorocha attempts to go out or catch up with him at any public place or function instead of the alleged breaking in through the ceiling.\n\n\u201cWhile we heartily appreciate the President Muhammed Buhari\u2019s government in exposing the unbridled fleecing of our commonwealth under whatever guise, we at CACOL enjoin the Administration to not only retrieve all ill-gotten wealth from wherever it has been repatriated but to ensure that adequate deterrence is meted out on those indicted for the evils of corruptive practices to take flight from our sociopolitical space.\n\n\u201cWe also call on EFCC to expedite the prosecution of Senator Rochas Okorocha and his partners in crime and if found guilty, should be punished by the law, through the appropriate section of the Criminal Law.\u201d",

I believe that the Electoral Act is a product of the legislative process and that has been done and it was not done earlier and then we have a timeline and guideline of INEC, so we\u2019ll have to manage it.\n\n\u201cI think the less the merrier as somebody who is in the race.

That was why my campaign set sail on a democratic journey that took us to all the nooks and crannies of our dear state. We covered all the local governments and we could see the enthusiasm on the faces of our people who are desirous of change to a progressive government with a human face.\n\n\u201cWe committed human and material resources, preaching the \u201cRise Up Abia\u201d message for the total emancipation of our State from the drudgery of imposition and godfatherism, which has seen the state at the lowest wrung of infrastructural, human and material development index among the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cOur people were and are indeed fired up for a new lease of life that will be brought about by a people\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt that Abians are tired of being subjected to being the butt of jokes and ridicule from their peers, particularly those from the contiguous states that were hitherto far behind Abia State in the development index in the time past. That was the narrative we sought to change when the campaign took off.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the ugly developments ignited by a rapacious ambition to maintain the wicked governance status quo of imposition and godfatherism have aborted this quest in PDP.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe will not be part of this charade. I am therefore withdrawing from the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship primary election that holds in Abia State on Wednesday 25th of May, 2022 as doing so would have amounted to an endorsement of illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, ask all our people, our teeming supporters and Ndigbo to remain calm, keep the faith and wait for the new direction, which will be announced very soon.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that the campaign to liberate Abia State would surely assume a new dimension.

What worked for him in 2019 is no longer in place. For one, the Wike factor is non-existent.\n\nGeopolitical zones analysis indicates how the aspirants may fare at the primary, as shown below:\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nNorth Central\n\nProjection shows that Saraki is most favoured in the North Central. His standing is boosted by the presence of the retired military general who participated in the consensus arrangement in the North. Saraki and Governor Mohammed were chosen as consensus candidates. Also, Mohammed is looking strong as well, likewise Atiku, but the former Senate president rates higher than others in Kwara, where he is expected to take all votes, as well as Niger, where Generals Ibrahim Babangida and Abdulsalami Abubakar hold sway .\n\nIt is expected that Saraki, Mohammed and Atiku would share votes in Kogi, Nasarawa and Plateau, with the former Senate President getting the highest. The only North Central State that shows some favouring of southern candidates is Benue, where Wike, working with Governor Samuel Ortom, is popular as well as Obi.\n\nSouth East\n\nWith the agitation for a president from South East on the plate, the zone has six aspirants. They are making strong showing within and outside the zone. Power brokers from the region, understandably, have their preferred aspirants even beyond the zone.\n\nWike, with support of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, would get chunk of votes in Abia and Enugu states respectively. Saraki is strongly favoured in Anambra and also Enugu, because of former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. Obi is okay in Anambra, while Tambuwal is projected to take half of votes in Imo because of ex-Imo state governor , Emeka Ihedioha. Former Senate President, Anyim Puis Anyim, is strong in Ebonyi and is projected to register good showing in virtually all the states in the zone.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe other percentage of votes from Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Enugu, Anambra will mostly be shared among Obi, Saraki and Atiku\n\nSouth West\n\nApart from former Ekiti Governor, Ayo Fayose, there is no other aspirant from South West. It is expected that Fayose will lock up Ekiti, while Wike looks good for Oyo, given his intimacy with Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nIn Lagos, Ogun, Ondo and Osun, it is battle between Atiku and Saraki. Saraki\u2019s half Yoruba heritage, per se, and marriage affiliation, however, gives him an edge in the South West.\n\nSouth South\n\nOrdinarily, it should have been taken for granted that Wike sweep the South South, but the presence of Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel alters the equation. Wike would take Rivers while Emmanuel takes Akwa Ibom. Delta, Cross River and Edo are for grab by Saraki, Atiku and Obi. Bayelsa tilts towards Governor Mohammed because of relationship with former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nNorth East\n\nAtiku and Mohammed are from the zone. Therefore, the battle is between the two of them. Atiku is projected to take Adamawa while Mohammed takes Bauchi.\n\nVotes from the other states like Borno, Yobe, Gombe and Taraba would be shared among Mohammed, Saraki and Atiku. Gen Theophilus Danjuma factor favours Saraki in Taraba. Mohammed rates tops here.\n\nNorth West\n\nFor Sokoto State and the entire North West, Governor Tambuwal remains the most prominent aspirant. However, the governor is not considered too popular to mop up all the votes in the zone. It is, however, expected that he will take Sokoto. However, Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Kaduna and Jigawa states would be shared between Saraki, Atiku and Mohammed, with Tambuwal getting a sprinkle. The major harvest state is Kano with 45 votes. If Saraki\u2019s strong push translates to votes, he is the candidate to beat in Kano as well as Katsina.\n\nLikely outcome:\n\nFrom projection, the battle for the PDP presidential ticket would be tight, with victory margin slim. It is expected that the winner could pool between 250 and 270 votes, while the first runner up would garner 180 and 210 votes and third runner-up from 150 \u2013 170 votes. The dynamics would, however, change if some aspirants pull out of the race and step down for key contenders.",

          "title": "Citing Inflationary Concerns, CBN Raises MPR to 13%, First Increase in 30 Months",
          "text": "\u2022Says action aimed at supporting economic growth, price stability\n\nJames Emejo and Nume Ekeghe in Abuja\n\n\n\nAfter holding the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), yesterday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the apex bank lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of funds in the economy.\n\nThe MPC, however, left other monetary policy parameters, including the apex bank\u2019s Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR), unchanged at 27.5 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of the MPC, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, admitted that the hike in MPR would increase cost of borrowing, especially in non-priority sectors of the economy.\n\nEmefiele, however added that lending to key priority sectors, which had been identified to boost growth and generate employment, would remain at single-digit interest rate of nine per cent.\n\nThe central bank governor pointed out that the decision to raise interest rate was the last resort and a difficult one for the MPC, which had been crafting policies to stimulate economic growth as well as achieve financial stability. He said the CBN had adopted a contractionary monetary policy stance in view of the aggressive rise in inflation in recent times, which had led to high food and commodity prices in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that CBN\u2019s action was aimed at curbing inflation, on the one hand, and supporting growth of the economy, on the other. He said the MPC was in a dilemma in arriving at a decision to raise the lending rate. As a result, the apex bank governor explained, a drastic measure such as raising the benchmark lending rate was required to reduce monetary expansion in order to tame inflation.\n\nHe assured that though inflation was expected to maintain an aggressive acceleration in the coming months, the central bank would not hesitate to return to its accommodative stance whenever it saw a reduction in the headline index.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe concerns about the global rise in inflation and price levels; you all would have seen that the price of crude quite unexpectedly has been above $100 per barrel. In fact, Nigeria\u2019s Bonny light yesterday, when we started the meeting, was about $116 per barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the standard pricing indicator; yes, whereas crude prices have gone up per barrel, at the same time the cost of refining and ultimate pump price at the station would naturally have gone up.\n\n\u201cThis is a global phenomenon and I was watching the CNN a few days ago and one of the analysts was talking about an incredible distortion to financial markets in the United States, and I said, yes, we are all welcome to a situation where inflation is rising to unprecedented levels in the US and other economies, growth is also coming down.\n\n\u201cAnd if you must tackle inflation, prices, and at the same time you want growth, then you know that you are faced with some compelling dilemma as to what to do.\n\n\u201cYou like to see inflation come down but at the same time you want growth to go up. But to achieve that, you have to take two decisions that are in opposite directions and that brings to bear what type of skills you have put in place to ensure you are able to manage these two in a way that you maintain a balance when you see a moderation in inflation and at the same time you grow your economy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFor us in Nigeria, you would have observed that in the last two and a half years, what we have been doing is that we want to pursue a policy of price stability that is conducive to growth and that\u2019s why somehow we have used our development finance intervention facilities, we have actually yielded positive results and helped to drive growth in our economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used that to drive growth while at the same time we try as much as possible to maintain a hold position while looking at the optimum level of liquidity in the industry to be able to moderate inflation at a level that does not hurt the growth and economy of our country.\n\n\u201cBut with what we have seen globally either in the areas of the supply chain, increases in prices of petroleum products, and the rest of them, we have seen aggressive growth in inflation in Nigeria between March and April of 2022.\n\n\u201cAnd the forecast from our statisticians, including the NBS and CBN as well as our colleagues in research and monetary policy, is that unless something drastic or significant actions are taken, it will be difficult for us to really rein in inflation if we don\u2019t do something immediately.\n\n\u201cThis decision has been taken because we felt that there may continue in the next couple of months to be an aggressive acceleration in inflation and we think there is a need to take some drastic actions to reverse it.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to see a reversal, perhaps, we can say we are returning to what we can call the normal period, when we are looking at using CRR to moderate inflation and at the same time using our development finance to really push for growth.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the broad outlook for both the global and domestic economies in the medium-term remained clouded with uncertainties arising from the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine, the unfolding impact of the extensive sanctions imposed by several countries on Russia, and the downside risks from the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe added that global growth was confronted with significant headwinds, which might derail the current projection further, adding that the continuing rise in inflation is also set to undermine the recovery of output growth due to the associated build-up of uncertainties around the cost of inventory and other production inputs.\n\nThe CBN governor said the rise in global debt was also an unfolding dilemma, which policymakers must carefully evaluate and address to avert a near-term global financial crisis.\n\nIn summary, he said, while global aggregate demand remained strong and growing, the numerous supply-side constraints would continue to undermine the recovery effort, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nIn the domestic economy, the CBN governor noted that data on key macroeconomic variables indicated that the recovery of output growth will continue, probably at a more subdued pace, considering the unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy.\n\nHe said domestic price development was, however, expected to maintain an upward pressure in light of the build-up of spending related to the 2023 general election.\n\nThe MPC noted the risks confronting the global economy involved not only inflation and prices, but also included risks associated with weakening growth prospects across the world.\n\nThe committee observed that whereas post-pandemic policy support remained broadly expansionary, at least, from a fiscal standpoint, the sharp rise in inflation across both the advanced and emerging markets economies had generated growing concern among central banks, as the progressive rise in inflation, driven by rising aggregate demand and wage growth, was putting unsustainable upward pressure on price levels.\n\nConsequently, Emefiele said, major central banks, such as the US Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada, had provided strong guidance for a progressive shift away from monetary policy accommodation to drive market interest rate upward, which may ultimately impact capital flow away from Emerging Market Economies.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn another hand, MPC noted that the war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in significant disruption of the global supply chain, at a time when the global economy is still confronted with downside risks to growth associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to this, global trade has been impacted by the series of restrictions imposed by NATO countries and its allies against trade with Russia.\n\n\u201cThis has increasingly fragmented the global economy, imposing huge strains on the tepid post-pandemic recovery. Only recently, China, the USA, and South Africa are seeing a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the Chinese government recently re-introduced lockdown in major industrial cities, to forestall the spread of the pandemic, further disrupting the supply chain crisis. In the view of the MPC, these two risks pose great challenges to rising inflation globally.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the CBN governor said on the decision on whether to hold, tighten or loosen, the MPC felt that loosening in the face of the rising policy rates in advanced economies might result in a sharp rise in capital outflow and faster dry-up of foreign credit lines.\n\nEmefiele stated, \u201cMPC also feels that loosening could lead to further liquidity surfeit and inflationary pressure. So as to whether to hold, MPC feels its stance would strengthen the perception that the CBN has abandoned its primary mandate of taming inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the need to tighten, MPC feels that tightening would help moderate the inflationary trade-off from the steady growth recovery so far. MPC also feels that tightening would help rein in inflation before it assumes a galloping trend, considering the progressive increase in headline inflation (m-o-m), particularly with the sharp 90 basis point increase in April 2022.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cFurthermore, MPC feels that tightening would narrow the negative real interest rate margin, improve market sentiment, and restore investor confidence.\n\n\u201cEqually, members believe tightening would moderate inflationary pressure pass-through to exchange rate depreciation and moderate the speed of capital flow reversal, provide incentives for foreign capital inflows, and sustain remittances.\n\n\u201cLastly, tightening could moderate government domestic borrowing, as government debt servicing to revenue ratio increased significantly in recent times, threatening debt sustainability.\u201d\n\nHe said MPC members expressed deep concern about the continued uptrend of inflationary pressure, despite the gradual improvement in output growth.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe committee noted that the current rise in inflation may be inimical to growth and, thus, hinder the full recovery of the economy. While the MPC identified several supply-side factors, which may be contributing to inflationary pressure, emerging evidence shows that money demand pressure is on the rise and is unlikely to abate until the 2023 general elections are concluded.\n\n\u201cThe dilemma confronting the committee at this meeting, therefore, is how best to drive down domestic prices while continuing to support the fragile recovery.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing the developments of the last two months and the outlook for both the domestic and global economies, as well as the benefits and downsides of each policy option, the committee decided to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to rein in the current rise in inflation, as members were of the view that the continued uptrend would adversely affect growth.\u201d\n\nAnalysts React to MPR Hike\n\nCommenting on the MPR adjustment by the CBN, Investment Analyst, Ayodeji Ebo, noted that the rate hike came as a surprise considering the magnitude and a major drift from the previous stance of the CBN. According to him, raising MPR will not necessarily translate to increased foreign portfolio investments due to the foreign exchange challenges.\n\nEbo told THISDAY, \u201cThis will lead to the high cost of borrowing for firms and the government. As a result, lead to a higher cost of production and a higher inflation rate. This will make the stock market less attractive, leading to a downtrend. Also, the fixed income market will be bearish in the interim, as traders try to minimise losses on their portfolios.\u201d\n\nFounder and Chief Executive of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), an economic and business advocacy think tank, Dr. Muda Yusuf, explained that while the hike in MPR by 150 basis points to 13 per cent by the MPC was understandable, \u201cwhether this would significantly impact on the inflation is a different matter.\u201d\n\nYusuf said, \u201cAlready, bank lending has been constrained by the high CRR (many operators in the sector claim that effective CRR is as high as 50 per cent or more for many banks), the discretionary debits by the apex bank, the 65 per cent Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) and liquidity ratio of 30 per cent. The lending situation in the economy is already very tight.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy is not a credit-driven economy, unlike what obtains in many advanced economies, which have much higher levels of financial inclusion, robust consumer credit framework and strong correlation between interest rate and aggregate demand.\n\n\u201cThe level of financial inclusion in the Nigerian economy is still quite low, access to credit by households and MSMEs is still very challenging, and the informal sector accounts for close to 50 per cent of the economy.\u201d\n\nYusuf added, \u201cThe transmission effects of monetary policy on the economy are, therefore, still very weak. In the Nigerian context, price levels are not interest-sensitive. Supply-side issues are much more profound drivers of inflation. What the recent rate hike means for the economy is that the cost of credit to the few beneficiaries of the bank credits will increase, which will impact their operating costs, prices of their products and profit margins. Investors in the fixed income instruments may also benefit from the hike. There would be some adverse effects on the equities market.\u201d\n\nHead, Financial Institutions Ratings at Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi, said the hike was not surprising, considering the rising inflation as well as the tilting of members of the MPC in favour of a hike in rates in previous meetings.\n\nAccording to Olubunmi, \u201cIf you have been following the communiqu\u00e9 of individual members, you would notice that gradually over the last couple of months, most members have moved from maintaining to an increase. At the last meeting, it was just a narrow decision for them to maintain it.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising and if looked at in the context of what is happening globally, interest rates are rising and one of the major ways the CBN can actually make Nigeria look a bit more competitive is for them to raise rates.\n\n\u201cGlobally, inflation rate is also increasing and in Nigeria, while there are other factors that contribute to rising inflation, one of the ways of combating that is to also raise rates.\n\n\u201cAlso, with electioneering, there would be a significant increase in money in circulation and one of the ways to try reduce the effect of that transmitting to higher inflation is to actually raise rates.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says power shift against democratic principles, zoning a lazy argument\n\n\u2022Declares \u2018I\u2019m going in to win, my message has resonated well\u2019\n\n\u2022Reveals Abiola invested almost 25 years of goodwill across the country\n\n\u2022Believes anyone who wants to be president should work hard, build alliances\n\nObinna Chima, Goddy Egene and Peter Uzoho\n\n\n\nFormer Managing Director of FSB International Bank Plc., and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has said if the main opposition party is able to get its act together in terms of organisation and envisaging the antics of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), PDP would win the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential interview series, Hayatu-Deen, punctured arguments in favour of zoning or power shift. He said it was unreasonable for the country to be bogged down by power shift clamour and debate, stressing that the argument for zoning is not only lazy but also against democratic principles.\n\nHe said if he had been asked the question on zoning some weeks back, he would have loved to spend some quality time on the subject. But PDP had already deferred to wisdom by throwing its presidential ticket open, he stated.\n\nAnalysing the chances of PDP in next year\u2019s general election, Hayatu-Deen, who explained the rationale behind the proposed consensus northern candidate and why it failed, said, \u201cLet me say that the reason for putting in place that framework for producing a consensus candidate from the northern part of the country was informed by two or three reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the field was getting large both in the north and in the south to the point where it would become difficult to manage at the convention.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the election of 2023 is PDP\u2019s to lose and if caution is not exercised, APC may actually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat if we have an acrimonious convention.\n\n\u201cThirdly was that the consensus arrangement was actually going to happen in stages. That the north should reduce the field to one person or maximum of two and, second, that this particular message should actually also be taken to the southern part of the country. At the time, we knew more people were going to come out, but only Pius Anyim had come out as at the time.\n\n\u201cLo and behold, after a few weeks, there were far more contestants in the southern part of the country than the north. So, we now started going to various parts of the country, preaching to the governors of the PDP to do other things in their powers to actually shrink the field in the south so that when we go to the convention, we\u2019ll have few people to narrow this process.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, the consensus arrangement in the north fell apart simply because the candidates felt that the basis for it existed no more and, therefore, it was better for each person to actually run their own independent campaign. In so doing, taking cognisance of two things: that we would be able to establish very good relationships among ourselves.\n\n\u201cAlso, it provided a teaching moment as we go to the convention to begin to put together some kind of framework even before the convention as to how these things will coalesce and still have a very successful convention and produce a candidate. So, those were the reasons.\u201d\n\nDismissing the idea of zoning, Hayatu-Deen stated, \u201cThis issue has been up in the air and travelling at just 1000 miles per hour, it\u2019s now an open and shut case that has gone to the highest policymaking body of the party and they decided to open it up for all. Let me tell you this, first, in 1999, beginning from preparations in 1998, this is now almost 23 to 24 years, there was a major event that took place during MKO Abiola\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cFollowed by a lot of commotion from many places, leading up to 1998, it was decided by the party bigwigs that given what had happened, it was important for us to stabilise this country, to hand over power to somebody from the South-west to compensate the denial of Abiola\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThere was no constitutional provision, there was no referendum taken among the south, and this is how the world works. It was an open contest. People like Abubakar Rimi, Philip Asiodu, and others ran to me and contested about that. That was a private arrangement that was done. So, we were able to organise to shift the votes to Obasanjo. Secondly, it\u2019s now almost a generation and after 23 years, we are still bogged down with power shift. I think it\u2019s unreasonable.\n\n\u201cThirdly, it goes against the principles of democracy as far as I\u2019m concerned. You cannot shut anyone out under a democratic contest. Anybody who is eligible that meets the criteria to either vote for somebody or be voted for, let him go on. I refuse to accept the lazy argument that this thing should be zoned and given to a particular zone.\n\n\u201cAbiola invested almost 20 to 25 years of goodwill across the country. Tofa, who was a very popular person in Kano, lost Kano to Abiola. Anybody from the South-east or South-south or the north, who wants to become president, should go and do that hard work and build alliances. Nigerians are good people. If you show them that you actually have their back and you are waiting for them, you will be amazed.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated further, \u201cIn 1999, a large section of the northern establishment, over 80 per cent of them, who were military were backing Alex Ekwueme for the presidency. As journalists, I will encourage you to send messages to people to actually go out there and build friendship and relationships and sow the seeds.\n\n\u201cYou will be surprised that an Ibibio or an Igbo guy or Ijaw man can easily get elected president, because the democratic space is very free and very open, and it\u2019s all about relationships. That investment has to happen. There is no reason why Mohammed Hayatu-Deen should be prevented from exercising his own democratic and human rights. That\u2019s my answer to that question.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his chances at the PDP presidential primary this weekend, Hayatu-Deen said, \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t go into anything without actually reflecting very carefully about it. Secondly, the reason why I went in is not because I want anything out of it personally for myself, my family or my friends.\n\n\u201cI see this country standing on a brink, almost approaching a failed state. All the sounds and stress are there for who wants to see; the structural holes, the cracks are there for anybody to see. I don\u2019t want to be a bystander watching what is going on, only for my conscience to say, if something terrible happens, what were you doing then? That you decided to stay in your private comfort and you refused to get into the murky waters of politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to hold me accountable down the road and say, \u2018daddy, what were you doing?\u2019 Or ordinary Nigerians to say, \u2018we know this guy, he has so much to offer, he\u2019s sitting down, because he doesn\u2019t want any mud on his face.\u2019 I think the time for courageous people in civil society space, in the private space has come.\n\n\u201cThere is no better time than now for us to enrich the pool of politicians in this country and get many men and women of quality and distinction, who are going to be there not because they are going to help themselves, not because they are going to help their friends and families, but because they believe they have something they can give.\u201d\n\nThe former banker added, \u201cI have done my maths very carefully and I\u2019m going in to win and my message has resonated very well with all of the delegates that I have actually visited. And it\u2019s a competitive race, I know there are many competitors there, but we have grand deals worked out and I\u2019m confident that I will put up a very good showing at the primaries coming up this week.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Teargas was also used inside Okorocha\u2019s residence by the operatives before whisking him off at 6:41pm, THISDAY gathered.\n\nOperatives of the commission had earlier yesterday stormed the Maitama, Abuja residence of Okorocha to effect his arrest. But Okorocha raised the alarm that the siege to his Abuja residence by men of the anti-graft agency was part of a grand plan to truncate his presidential ambition.\n\nThe senator, who addressed journalists inside his room, said the EFCC, which later reinforced and returned with additional men, had threatened to break the doors and forcefully take him away on the day of the APC presidential screening.\n\nOkorocha said, \u201dFrankly speaking, the situation I find myself is what I call hostage. Policemen and EFCC operatives are currently in my compound and possibly to whisk me away and my gate is blocked.\n\n\u201dAll I am asking for now is to allow me to go for my screening because I am a presidential aspirant and our election comes up on Sunday. If I am not allowed to go for this screening, I may miss it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI am not an unknown person in the country. I have an address and people know me in the country. All what it takes for the EFCC is to send me an invitation and I will gladly oblige.\u201d\n\nHowever, a statement issued later by the EFCC stated that the agency was after Okorocha following his refusal to honour an invitation extended to him after jumping bail.\n\nThe statement claimed, \u201cOperatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), today May 24, 2022, arrived at the Maitama, Abuja home of a former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, to effect his arrest.\n\n\u201cThe move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the commission.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by the spokesman of the commission, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, further said EFCC had on January 24, 2022 filed a 17-count criminal charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9 billion against Okorocha.\n\nIt said the case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, but attempts to arraign Okorocha were twice stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes.\n\nAt the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Ekwo, before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, warned that it was \u201cthe last adjournment I shall grant in this matter,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nThe agency also stated, \u201cin the circumstances, the commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC team was able to arrest Okorocha at 6:41pm in an operation that started around 10am.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The core income excluded forex gains of N45.8 billion in 2021 and N51.2 billion in 2020.\n\nProviding further breakdown of its performances in the review period, Orji said total comprehensive income declined marginally in 2021 by 8.2 per cent to close the year at N147.0 billion compared to N160.1 billion in 2020.\n\nNotwithstanding, he described the performance as a, \u201cvery solid result,\u201d adding \u201cwe\u2019re very pleased with the way we navigated 2021 as an authority.\u201d\n\nThe NSIA boss however noted that global inflation remained a significant disincentive to investments adding that it has continued to distort the global economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cReactions to the raging global inflation may lead to recessions in certain economies as central banks have announced varying measures of rate hikes and halt to balance sheet expansion.\n\n\u201cThe human and economic costs of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have continued to escalate resulting in heightened geopolitical tension, disruption of the global supply chain, inflation, and potential impact on food security.\u201d\n\nOrji added that: \u201cThe growth prospect in China will be undermined by its zero-tolerance stance on the emergence of COVID-19 leading to lockdown in different regions and cities.\u201d\n\nHowever, in view of the positive performances over the years, the NSIA MD said it was considering the idea of paying dividend to the shareholders of the fund including the federal and state governments. But he pointed out that the gesture was subject to the approval of the National Executive Council (NEC).\n\nOrji, said a decision would have to be made as to whether it was necessary for pay dividends now or plough back the proceeds into additional investment for greater returns, given that the NSIA returned $150 million in October 2020, to the government from the Stabilisation Fund in line with the provisions of the NSIA Act 2011.\n\nHe also hinted that the work on the Second Niger Bridge would be completed by December.\n\nAccording to him however, the single biggest risk for global capital market was complicated by the Russia- Ukraine war, as well as supply chain issues in China as it struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that, \u201cthese are all factors that create headwinds into 2022.\u201d\n\nOrji said, \u201cIn Nigeria, these global headwinds are exacerbated by challenges in the local environment. The World Bank, CBN, and Fitch have projected the Nigerian economy will grow by 2.5 per cent, 3.1 per cent, and 2.8 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the outcomes, the growth range will have minimal impact on the per-capita given the population growth rate at 2.5 per cent.\u201d\n\nOrji warned that financial performance of the NSIA in 2022 will be impacted by developments in the global and local environment given its exposure across the three funds namely the Stabilisation Fund, Future Generation Fund and Infrastructure Fund.\n\nBut he assured that the authority will take steps to strengthen the resilience of its strategy through diversification, portfolio selection, and other options to enhance the risk/ return profile and liquidity.\n\nHe said the ESG and assets transfer will be critical to the overall long-term strategy of the NSIA to expand access to third-party capital and support the global effort toward building a climate-resilient economy.\n\nOrji also said that the fund would make significant footprint in agriculture in 2022, stressing that \u201cwe\u2019ve been able to show the abilities in some areas and we\u2019re now going to roll out funding even more aggressively.\u201d\n\nHe insisted inflation remained major constraints to reasonable projections going forward.\n\nHe said, \u201cI did say, that there was just too much money pumped into the market globally and that there will be inflationary concerns. But I remember very smart economists dismissed it and said it was going to be a short-term thing; even some central bank governors, even the Federal Reserve, thought it was going to be short-term.\n\n\u201cWe did say at the time that it will not be and we say that purely as market participants who have seen what it is going to take to untangle the supply chain that has become an issue.\n\n\u201cBear in mind inflation is a big problem for investors. And when it is globalised and synchronised at the same time in the US, Europe, and across Africa, this will continue to challenge and affect returns in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI think that 2022 would be the toughest year of investing over the last 15 years. Since between 2008 and now this will be the toughest year for investing because navigating inflation and controlling it without triggering a recession is the biggest challenge that central bank governors all over the world have to deal with. And that is always not a good time for investment.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cSo I need you to understand that the outlook in 2022 and beyond will be affected by inflation and numbers may not be anywhere near as close to what they\u2019ve been historically. I think the world is now in a new phase of investment cycles, and we all should be prepared.\u201d\n\nHe further predicted a risk of recession in 2022 as central banks intensify efforts to curtail inflation.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenge and the navigation of what many of you are already seeing across most asset prices, particularly technology companies that have been highly valued over the last 2-3-4 years and now feeling the heat as interest rates start to rise in the efforts to contain inflation,\u201d Orji said.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is also something that is affecting emerging market debt. Also, this issue of rising interest rates as we curtail inflation I think will continue to affect, emerging market debt, particularly the Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cSo the first half of 2022 maybe up until the third quarter would remain challenging, but I\u2019m very optimistic that into the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, things will look a little bit better.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Enyinnaya Abaribe, a governorship hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia, has withdrawn from the party\u2019s primary election.\n\nThe senate minority leader announced his withdrawal from the governorship race in a statement issued on Wednesday.\n\nThe PDP governorship primaries are scheduled to take place today across the country.\n\nLast week, some governorship hopefuls and chieftains of the PDP in Abia had asked the national working committee (NWC) to take immediate action to prevent an \u201cimpending implosion\u201d of the party in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hopefuls had said no ward congresses were conducted in the state, hence the delegates\u2019 list is invalid.\n\nAbaribe attributed his withdrawal from the race to \u201cimaginary\u201d delegates, whom he said will vote in the primary.\n\n\u201cThe last couple of weeks has been tortuous as we battled hard to navigate our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) away from a self-destructive path. The essence was to create an unfettered democratic space and a level playing field for all aspirants vying for all elective offices in the state, to participate equally in the primary elections,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat was not the case and of course what we are witnessing is a shambolic process driven by a procured court injunction. To make matters worse, the use of only imaginary 3-man Adhoc delegates to the exclusion of the party\u2019s statutory delegates in the primary elections to elect our candidates even when INEC the nation\u2019s electoral umpire, has unequivocally stated that no congress held in Abia State for that purpose, has no doubt put the party and her candidates in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cThe implication for our party is grave and as such has put all ongoing primary exercises on quicksand. I am known for standing firm in defence of my convictions for the right of all people to a free and fair democratic process. That was why my campaign set sail on a democratic journey that took us to all the nooks and crannies of our dear state. We covered all the local governments and we could see the enthusiasm on the faces of our people who are desirous of change to a progressive government with a human face.\n\n\u201cWe committed human and material resources, preaching the \u201cRise Up Abia\u201d message for the total emancipation of our State from the drudgery of imposition and godfatherism, which has seen the state at the lowest wrung of infrastructural, human and material development index among the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cOur people were and are indeed fired up for a new lease of life that will be brought about by a people\u2019s government. There was no doubt that Abians are tired of being subjected to being the butt of jokes and ridicule from their peers, particularly those from the contiguous states that were hitherto far behind Abia State in the development index at the time past. That was the narrative we sought to change when the campaign took off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the ugly developments ignited by a rapacious ambition to maintain the wicked governance status quo of imposition and godfatherism have aborted this quest in PDP.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe will not be part of this charade. I am therefore withdrawing from the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship primary election that holds in Abia State on Wednesday 25th of May, 2022 as doing so would have amounted to an endorsement of illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.\u201d\n\nAbaribe asked members of the party and his supporters to \u201cremain calm, keep the faith and wait for the new direction, which will be announced very soon\u201d.",

Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can proptech solve Nigeria\u2019s urbanisation crisis?",
          "text": "\u201cNearly 75% of Nigerians living in major cities are tenants, and that says a lot about the need for houses,\u201d begins Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, who is moderating a Live session on property technology\u2014proptech\u2014in Nigeria. \u201cIt\u2019s a growing concern, especially as Nigeria is growing at the rate of 2.5% per annum. The question on everyone\u2019s mind is: where will these people live, and can they afford it?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the United Nations projected that Nigeria\u2019s population will double by 2050; that\u2019s over 400 million people living in Africa\u2019s 14th-largest country by land mass.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Nigeria doesn\u2019t have the land mass to accommodate these people; it is the second-largest West African country with 923,768 km2 (356,669 sq mi) surface area. The problem is that 51.96% of Nigeria\u2019s population\u2014the seventh-largest population globally\u2014is situated in densely-populated urban areas while the rest are scattered across rural communities. At the current growth rate of about 2.8%\u20133% a year, Nigeria\u2019s urban population is expected to double in the next 2 decades.\n\nUrbanisation, especially one as rapid as Nigeria\u2019s, comes with challenges, most notably the insufficiency of basic infrastructures. Some studies suggest that rapid urbanisation has caused most cities in Nigeria to undergo urban decay because of a lack of or breakdown in basic services, potable water supply, electricity, efficient city transport services, affordable housing, and waste disposal systems.\n\nAll these challenges have made house-hunting in urban areas a living hell, with searchers reporting problems like extortive rent prices, high agency inspection fees, duplicity of sales, and misrepresentation. In fact, between December 2020 and April 2021, Nairametrics estimates that rent across urban areas like Lagos and its environs increased by 30%.\n\nIn solving this problem, many have turned to tech. If tech can push financial inclusion in Nigeria from 21.6% in 2010 to 64.1% in 2020, then surely it can do the same for housing.\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s proptech industry raising $2 million in investments in 2021 alone, TechCabal sought to answer these questions in a Live session. On May 6, 3 startup founders\u2014Naomi Olaghere, co-founder and VP/Operations, RentSmallSmall; Kanyinsade Ademuson, founder, CEO and Principal Architect of Seventh Space; and Dapo Eludire, COO of PropertyPro.ng\u2014sat with TechCabal Senior Reporter Daniel Adeyemi to discuss the prospects of proptech in Nigeria.\n\nIn small small instalments\n\nNaomi Olaghere kicks off the session by explaining what her startup, RentSmallSmall\u2014a Lagos-based on-demand service offering instalment rent payment options\u2014is doing. \u201cIt\u2019s a mindset thing,\u201d Olaghere says. \u201cPeople often think they have to have all their money together before they can buy something or even rent a house, but RentSmallSmall is changing that. We\u2019ve been in existence for 3 years now, and we\u2019re letting people know that they can pay their rent like monthly, quarterly, monthly, or annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how does that benefit the landlord,\u201d Adeyemi asks. In Nigeria, annual rent is a practice vigorously upheld by most landlords with some requiring 2 years\u2019 advance from new tenants.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, it was a herculean task to get landlords to agree to collect monthly rent,\u201d Olaghere explains. \u201cIt\u2019s still an uphill battle, but we\u2019ve been able to show them the benefits of RentSmallSmall. For example, we can assure landlords that defaulting tenants will be out within a week because of our licensing agreements with the tenants. We\u2019re also very concerned with long-term preservation of assets, and that helps us build trust with landlords.\u201d\n\nDesign for your users\n\nAt Seventh Space, Kanyinsade Ademuson and his team believe in developing houses for the average upwardly-mobile Nigerian.\n\n\u201cLast year, I was in the market for an apartment for 6 months, and I have to tell you, I\u2019ve seen houses,\u201d Daniel Adeyemi exclaims. \u201cSome \u2018affordable\u2019 houses with 2 feet kitchens, and some houses overpriced because of POP ceilings. What kind of solutions are there for affordable and habitable housing?\u201d\n\nAdemuson believes the answer is simple: \u201cStop developing houses that your target market can\u2019t afford.\u201d \u201cIf you look at the property trends today, builders are developing for people who genuinely can\u2019t afford them. However, I think that one of the major solutions we can provide is actually getting designs that are centred around average Nigerians who are genuinely poor.\u201d\n\nThe way to do that, Ademuson says, is by taking advantage of underutilised properties and increasing the speed of production. \u201cThere are a lot of lands that are owned but unused. Part of the solution is to create policies that ensure the usage of underutilised lands. We also have to consider our environment, and build for the environment we are in. We need to look at different technologies or building technology methods, using different materials and materials that we can research and create here, within Nigeria, and which are suitable for our environment.\u201d\n\nFinally, Ademuson says, the next step is to produce quickly and in large quantities. \u201cWe need to figure out a way to produce more, and this means factory-assembled production or linear production that caters to the needs of people while driving the prices of houses down.\u201d\n\nNo space for data or trust\n\nFor Dapo Eludire whose startup, PropertyPro.ng, is one of Nigeria\u2019s leading real-estate search platforms, the solution lies in finding and housing data.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have centralised data,\u201d Eludire laments. \u201cThe data we have is collated by individuals, not by the government so you can\u2019t depend on it. We don\u2019t know the market trends or its movements, and so we are forced to move blindly.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust is the next step, as Eludire believes. \u201cLiquidity in the real estate sector is not enough, so everyone is careful of whom they buy from. A lot of scrutiny goes into deals, and this elongates timelines. But building trust will allow deals to flow accordingly so everyone can manage their time well.\u201d\n\nCollaboration breeds growth\n\nProptech deals across Africa are gradually growing, projected to increase by 6.4% between 2019 and 2024. All 3 founders agree that a large contributor to the growth is collaboration.\n\n\u201cProptech has sub-sectors,\u201d Olaghere explains. \u201cThere\u2019s the financial part, the construction segment, the user segment etc. And a lot of proptech companies have begun to understand the importance of collaborating with stakeholders in the different sectors. This is what has helped with growth and development.\u201d\n\nAdemuson believes that most of the growth has been on the service or software end at the expense of the hardware end which has been left out. \u201cWe\u2019re lagging on the production end of things, and we need to figure out how to build better and faster for our end users.\u201d\n\nBuilding ahead\n\nIn search of better growth, Eludire believes that the next step in proptech development is for the private financing sector to provide more liquidity for users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always an expensive venture whenever you\u2019re buying or renting a property. People use over 40% of their annual earnings for rent alone. We have to create and enable more liquidity in Nigeria, just like what Naomi and RentSmallSmall is doing. Because of solutions like that, more Nigerians are able to afford housing.\u201d\n\nEludire also calls on the government to enforce licensing of trained real estate agents. \u201cEverybody is a real estate agent in Nigeria, and most are untrained. There are no rules, no guidelines or etiquette that they learn; they\u2019re all just there for the commission. We don\u2019t even know how many agents we have because everyone is in it, and that\u2019s why agents misbehave, extort renters, and misrepresent property owners.\u201d\n\nNigeria has no federal law mandating the registration of real estate agents, but it does it have state laws or policies regulating their activities like the Lagos State Property Protection Law of 2016. However, none of these laws mandates registration for agents, so there is no recourse for tracking the activities of wayward agents.\n\nSolving this problem, as Eludire explains, will help ease renters\u2019 experiences in the sector.\n\nIn closing, Olaghere reiterates the importance of collaboration between the government, the proptech sector, and more importantly, the end users.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share to your network on WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has created a new tax on phone calls in the bid to fund free healthcare for Nigerian citizens who cannot afford healthcare\u2014the vulnerable group. The law defines the \u201cvulnerable group\u201d in society as \u201cChildren under five, pregnant women, aged, physically and mentally challenged persons, and indigent people as may be defined from time to time\u201d.\n\nThis new law is stated in the new National Health Insurance Authority Bill 2021, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari last week.\n\nThe provisions of Section 26 sub-section 1c of the Act states that the source of money for the Vulnerable Group Fund includes \u201ctelecommunications tax, not less than one kobo per second of GSM calls.\u201d\n\nOther sources of income for the Vulnerable Group Fund include the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, health insurance levies, grants, donations, gifts, and any other voluntary contributions. The law also requires that all persons resident in Nigeria are expected to obtain health insurance.\n\nWith average call rates of 11 Kobo per second, this new act implies that there will be a tax of at least 9% on every second of all phone calls made in Nigeria.\n\nNigerians made 150.83 billion minutes of calls in 2020 according to a report by the Nigerian Communications Commission. This translates to 9.05 trillion seconds of calls, meaning the new tax will generate at least 9.05 trillion Kobo, which converts to \u20a690.49 billion ($18.09 million), annually.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when this new tax will take effect and how much it\u2019ll be but it hints that there\u2019ll be an increase in call-tariffs in Nigeria, as it\u2019s unlikely that the telecom companies will absorb the cost.\n\nLast month, telecom companies under the umbrella of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria proposed a 40% increase in the cost of calls, SMS, and data as a result of the rising cost of operating in the country. This new tax creates a more compelling case for the telcos to hike their prices.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEver had to deal with fraud or a fraudulent person? Then the story of @Ade_authority \u2014 a tweeter \u2014 from March 2022 should be quite relatable, especially if you run a business.\n\nA customer has been ordering since 28th of February and been sending fake alert\n\n\n\nHe has ordered 4 different times , looking through the statement now, all fake alert amounting to 32000naira\n\n\n\nThe lesson from all of this is: Don\u2019t ever use zenith bank as your corporate account \u2014 Ade Authority (@Ade_authority) March 12, 2022\n\nOne of her customers had ordered ewa agoyin from her four times in under a month. Unfortunately, he sent fake debit alerts for each transaction, totalling \u20a632,000.\n\nLuckily, she recovered her money, but not everyone is that fortunate. And like these articles from The Guardian, Punch, and Vanguard show, these occurrences are not rare. Stories about fake credit alerts are the order of the day for many merchants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho will bell the cat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction\u2019s Success team\n\nUsually, for many of these merchants or small businesses, recovering this kind of money requires some blood and sweat and is a lengthy process, leading some to give up eventually.\n\nAnother angle to the problem is their inability to confirm whether these alerts are fake at first glance. So except they do a constant balancing of the books, or by some stroke of luck notice the discrepancy early enough as @Ade_authority did, they might not get their money back.\n\nAnd with more transactions done without physical interactions, finding the culprit could sometimes become like the proverbial needle in the haystack.\n\nTraction, a Nigeria-based fintech, thinks it can solve this problem using its proprietary solution.\n\nThe company provides an app that business owners can use to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables the merchant\u2019s employee\u2019s to confirm payments without having to call their employer.\n\nHowever, beyond this, Traction has a unique feature which helps merchants confirm that every alert is real. According to Seyi Xodus, Traction Apps Growth Marketing Manager, if the money hasn\u2019t been reflected on their platform, the alert is fake, or the money hasn\u2019t been sent.\n\nThe app gives users a virtual bank account powered by Providus Bank and can be used to make transfers and carry out other transactions.\n\nAccording to Xodus, \u201cWe are able to confirm that the alerts are genuine because we get notified directly from the virtual account custodian, which is Providus Bank. We only rely on the bank notification rather than a merchant\u2019s notification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe average wait time for an alert is ten seconds.\n\nWhat is the vision?\n\nMayowa Alli and Dolapo Adejuyigbe, Traction Apps Co-founders, met while working together at McKinsey & Company. Alli would later leave the company but return after a stint at Konga and completing his MBA at the Institut Europ\u00e9en d\u2019Administration des Affaires (INSEAD) in France.\n\nThough they would not found Traction until 2018, they had been having conversations regarding building something related for small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe had a passion for entrepreneurship, and we were always exchanging ideas of what to do,\u201d Adejuyigbe said.\n\nOne word that reverberated throughout the conversation was \u201cecosystem.\u201d A function, perhaps, of their years of consultancy with McKinsey and the learnings they got from other work experiences.\n\n\u201cMayowa and I were colleagues, and we used to work with a lot of banks. And everyone was trying to figure out how to really understand SMEs, but also how to provide optimal solutions for them. But the problem was that they couldn\u2019t fully understand that because a lot of SMEs are multi-banked and use different account numbers and platforms to run their business.\u201d\n\nSo they set out to build an ecosystem of products that covers the life cycle of how a business is run through three core levers: payments, lending, and retail management.\n\nWith payments, Traction currently provides Point of Sale (PoS) terminals for its merchants but also strongly leans towards offline payment options like Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and Quick Response (QR) codes, which Adejuyigbe says will be rolled out soon.\n\nTo help with network issues, Traction allows for offline reconciliation.\n\nIt also recently launched Cash Advance, its lending option which enables access to credit for customers who have been on the platform for two months. Repayment doesn\u2019t begin until a month after disbursement and is repaid through daily deductions.\n\nOn the retail management front, Traction is looking to provide inventory replenishment and management services to its users via partnerships.\n\n\u201cMerchants are going on the app or the web at least 20 times a day to confirm transactions. So there\u2019s that stickiness, and it now makes a lot of sense that if there\u2019s already that high level of activity and engagement, rather than other startups or platforms trying to build standalone platforms, they can essentially walk through Traction to do that. So that\u2019s essentially the super app proposition as well.\u201d\n\nEarning in percentages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Apps makes money off all of its verticals. So with payments, it ranges between 0.4 \u2013 0.5%. It also charges a 3% fee for lending and earns about 1-5% from customers using its software.\n\nCurrently, they are present in eight Nigerian states and serve big-name merchants like The Place, Bukka Hut, Pinkberry, Cold Stone, and Sweet Sensation, among others.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Pascal Ntsama, Co-Founder and CEO of Canza Finance got admitted to Georgia Southern University to study advanced mathematics, he had vague plans of becoming a rocket scientist.\n\nA year later, he transferred to Georgia Institute of Technology to study electrical and electronics engineering before going on to get a Masters in Computer/Information Technology and Management at Georgetown University.\n\nGetting into Georgia Tech was eye-opening, and had him working with students who had been around computers all their lives. To stay ahead, he had to work twice as hard. After learning of an opportunity to work with some professors as a researcher, he applied and got accepted, marking the beginning of his time in technology.\n\nAt Georgia Tech, he worked on cutting-edge technologies, including 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), and electric vehicles, long before they became mainstream.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter graduation, Ntsama went on to work at AT&T, where the same theme of working on early technologies continued. There he would meet Oyedeji Oluwoye, who was working on deploying fibre across parts of Asia.\n\nBoth immigrants (Oluwoye is a Nigerian and Ntsama is Cameroonian) often bounced ideas around boosting Internet penetration in Africa. Oluwoye, who had worked on cryptocurrencies while doing his Masters, also advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrencies, but he was not convinced.\n\nIn the meantime, the two started a business consulting for companies and governments worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe kind of work we did was we would send a document to organisations without being asked. For example, we found out that the Ministry of Communications in Cameroon wanted to build a data centre, so we created a research document that answered all their questions.\n\n\u201cOur thinking was \u2018we\u2019re a five-man team, so we can\u2019t go after big corporations, but if we do the work upfront, they might like us and give us a chance,\u2019\u201d Ntsama told Techpoint Africa over a call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nThey soon discovered it was not working, but Ntsama believes it gave them experience doing B2B outreach. In 2017, Oluwoye returned with the cryptocurrency gospel, only this time, he came with proof of his gains.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t even talk. He just showed me his Ethereum wallet. I didn\u2019t argue with him, I just bought some Ethereum, and we started trading. We were not doing anything special; we just got in at a time when the market was doing well.\u201d\n\nSoon the duo began to think of cryptocurrency beyond trading and, in 2017, founded Coincentrix, receiving a grant from the Zcash Foundation the following year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoincentrix worked with organisations, including the Hartsfield-Jackson Airport and a Brazilian company. The grant from the Zcash Foundation also helped them with outreaches to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).\n\nSharing the motivation for focusing on HBCUs, Ntsama said, \u201cAs Africans, we always tend to be on the consumption end, meaning we\u2019re not involved when it\u2019s early on. When the innovation starts, we probably have doubts about it and only get involved when it gets mainstream.\n\n\u201cOne thing we were trying to do was speak to students early so that they can understand cryptocurrencies and how to build solutions around it.\u201d\n\nThe road not taken\n\nOn Tuesday, July 27, 2021, Godwin Emefiele, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), announced an end to forex sales to bureau de change (BDC) operators.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWe have noted with disappointment and great concern that our bureau de change operators have abandoned the original objective of their establishment, which was to serve retail end users who need $5,000 or less. Instead, they have become (illegal) wholesale dealers in foreign exchange to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\u201d\n\nTwo years earlier, in 2019, Ntsama and Oluwoye had stumbled on the BDC operators while researching the nature of financial transactions in Nigeria and Cameroon. Fascinated by their operations, they decided to build their new startup, Canza Finance, around this group.\n\nTo understand what informed their decision, I\u2019ll paint a picture of how BDCs in Nigeria operate.\n\nAs an import-dependent country, Nigerian businesses often have to make payments for products they get from outside the country. Sourcing foreign exchange for doing this is, however, complicated. On the other hand, individuals need forex to pay for goods and services abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial banks in the country allocate personal travel allowance (PTA) and business travel allowance (BTA) every quarter. In most cases, this does not cover the cost of sourcing goods or paying for services for many people. Consequently, they need alternative sources of foreign exchange, which is where the BDCs come in.\n\nThey source for foreign exchange through remittances, local businesses, and the previously mentioned CBN allocations, which they provide to businesses and individuals who cannot get any through official channels. As such, they are an integral part of the Nigerian financial system.\n\nHowever, even after getting foreign exchange from the BDCs, settling cross-border business transactions often takes some time, a problem solved by using cryptocurrencies. Recognising this, Ntsama and Oluwoye decided to leverage their reach to provide a faster way for businesses and individuals to make payments.\n\nUsing third-party partners, the company can receive stablecoins from businesses or individuals to facilitate payments. Agents who make these transactions happen are paid in cryptocurrencies or cash, depending on their preference.\n\nHere\u2019s a possible scenario: Emeka sells laptops and computer accessories which he gets from China to businesses in Nigeria. He typically gets shipments of $100,000, but since his bank can only provide him with $10,000 for overseas payments, he has to use the BDC operators to make up the difference.\n\nUsually, these operators have networks that extend beyond the country, so they also help businesses make payments to their foreign partners. Canza Finance\u2019s role here is to substitute the dollar, for example, with a stablecoin, thus ensuring that businesses can make payments almost instantly rather than wait a few days.\n\nCross-border payments are not all the company does, as it also enables payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. It plans to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nFor Canza Finance\u2019s local P2P offering, a user simply places a buy or sell order on the USSD app, which Canza Finance routes to the closest FX agent. The user then meets up with the agent where they receive or deposit cash, depending on the type of transaction. The same applies to its local payment service.\n\nUsing cash when most fintech companies and even the CBN are pushing for a cashless economy may sound counterintuitive. Still, with CBN regulations prohibiting commercial banks from engaging in cryptocurrency transactions, this is the easiest way to stay in line with the regulation.\n\nInitially, the company planned to focus on its B2C vertical, but growing interest from B2B customers has necessitated a shift. Yet, Ntsama hopes the company will serve more B2C customers soon.\n\nLike most financial services institutions, Canza Finance makes money by charging users a transaction fee which Ntsama says is not more than 2% of the transaction value. This also applies to its treasury and asset management services which the startup has not yet launched.\n\nStanding out from the pack\n\nWhile the blockchain industry is relatively nascent in Africa, startups such as Lazerpay and Hellicarrier have sprung up to solve problems in the financial services industry. As a result, it could be difficult to understand how these companies differ, but Ntsama believes Canza Finance\u2019s use of the BDC operators makes it different from existing players.\n\n\u201cI would say what makes us different is that we decided to build based on natural behaviours. We have built around the FX agents because we understand that they have an important position in the financial structure of the continent, and it\u2019s most likely not going to fade away anytime soon; it\u2019s probably going to be the reason we succeed.\u201d\n\nUsing BDC operators is not the only differentiating factor Ntsama sees. He believes that Canza Finance\u2019s suite of products is an advantage rather than a distraction as they are all connected.\n\n\u201cMost startups would focus on one thing and provide one solution for that thing, but we\u2019re a company of companies which is very unusual for a startup.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith the African population expected to reach nearly 2.5 billion by 2050, Ntsama believes there is much room for growth. Presently, the startup predominantly operates in Nigeria. However, it facilitates cross-border payments to other countries and plans to move into Francophone Africa once it gets a good grip on the Nigerian market.\n\nBuilding a startup that facilitates transactions using cryptocurrencies comes with unique challenges, especially in Nigeria, where the Central Bank does not necessarily encourage it. However, Ntsama shares that the company is heavily investing in a legal and advisory team to ensure it is always on the right side of the law.\n\n\u201cWe have a whole legal and compliance strategy created by a legal advisory board of experts in the legal space and financial services. This will help us with our business structuring, and we can still do business without falling into issues with regulators.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Ntsama says their biggest challenge has been turning down money from businesses because they could not facilitate huge transactions. According to Ntsama, Canza has served 39 businesses and has a network of 203 FX agents across Nigeria.\n\nHaving closed a $3.27 million seed round led by Fenbushi Capital with participation from Dominance Ventures, Hashkey Capital, Boxing Ventures, Consensys, and Protocol Labs, the startup plans to improve its product and grow its team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

On this day, many African countries commemorate their hard-won liberation from European colonial powers.\n\nA little history: Formerly known as African Freedom Day, it was established on April 15, 1958, in Ghana. And between 1958 and 1963, the African and global nation-class struggle intensified.\n\nDuring this time, 17 African countries gained independence, and 1960 was declared the Year of Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn May 25, 1963, 31 African leaders met at a summit to form the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). They changed the name of Africa Freedom Day to \u201cAfrican Liberation Day\u201d and moved the date to May 25.\n\nBesides, countries like Ghana, Kenya, Spain, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the United States celebrate this day.\n\nSo, today, let us remember the struggles for liberation and development while we continue to raise political awareness globally.\n\nWell, here\u2019s today\u2019s outline:\n\nShaping the African mobility narrative\n\nFoondaMate\u2019s $2 million funding\n\nTwitter Create\n\nAMP\u2019s $5.6 million seed\n\nShaping the African mobility narrative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 will always be known as the calm before the storm that was the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. But it was also the year that we began to see what seemed like an avalanche of apps that helped you move from point A to B.\n\nConsequently, companies like GIG Mobility, Max.ng, and Gokada dominated the mobility space, and pan-African players like Safeboda soon followed.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s mobility companies have had varying successes, there are important factors that are currently unaddressed in the sector; cracks that are currently being covered up with technology.\n\nSo, major players in Africa\u2019s mobility space, led by mobility behemoth, GIG Mobility, are preparing to hold critical conversations about this. This inaugural event will take place on June 2, 2021, with the theme: Pathways to the Future of Mobility in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, the theme triggered some questions in me. First and foremost, are mobility players currently trying to change the narrative? If you ask me, I\u2019ll respond in the negative. But this is not about me.\n\nThe newly appointed CEO of GIG mobility, Enahoro Okhae, said, \u201cJust stepping into the mobility space, I realised the players in the space are not trying to shape the narrative.\u201d\n\nHence, the need to \u201chave several important discourses across different spheres for the industry to be stabilised.\u201d Now, the question is, how can they shape the mobility narrative?\n\nIf you want to know how, please read this story: How companies can shape the narrative for tech-enabled mobility in Africa\n\nFoondaMate\u2019s $2 million funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoondaMate co-founders from L-R: (Tao Boyle, Dacod Magagula); Source: Supplied\n\nLast year, Techpoint Africa featured FoondaMate, a South African edtech startup that helps students study using WhatsApp.\n\nHow? The WhatsApp API helps students download research papers, search concepts, define words, and perform simple mathematical calculations.\n\nAlso, it assists educators in assigning and posting homework to students and sharing other learning materials with them through its integrated resources.\n\nWhy WhatsApp? In South Africa, Whatsapp is widely used and cheaper or free to use. Further, the company claims that its learning chatbot is simple to use, inexpensive, and serves as a more organised alternative to using search engines for study.\n\nSo, yesterday, Tuesday, May 24, 2022, the startup announced that it had raised $2 million in seed funding to accelerate the global adoption of its Whatsapp and Facebook-based learning chatbot.\n\nLocalGlobe led the funding, with participation from Emerge Education, Odunayo Eweniyi via FirstCheckAfrica, Iyin Aboyeji via Future Africa, and LoftyInc, and angels from Luno (Marcus Swanepoel) and Justworks (Isaac Oates).\n\nFurther, the company says that it is currently working on localising its learning material to accommodate learners in more countries and propel the platform\u2019s growth to more than 50 million users. And will be using the funding to facilitate this.\n\nTo learn more about FoondaMate, please read this story: How South African edtech startup, FoondaMate, is helping students study with WhatsApp\n\nTwitter rebrands Twitter Media website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Twitter announced the rebranding of its Twitter Media website to \u201cTwitter Create.\u201d\n\nWhy? The microblogging platform says the website is a new hub for creators to access resources, product information, and Twitter tips because \u201cTwitter has become so much more than Tweets.\u201d\n\nOn the website, creators can find resources organised by industry like sports, gaming, news, writers, and so on. Also, the website includes guides based on their goals, which can be making money, engaging with their audience, or growing their brand.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Twitter has introduced tools for creators. Remember that the company recently launched a tool for creators called the \u201cCreator Dashboard.\u201d\n\nThis tool is designed to help creators analyse how they make money on Twitter and how much they earn from monetisation features like Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the new rebranding aims to make it easier for creators to understand and connect with other creators through Twitter\u2019s creator products.\n\nAMP\u2019s $5.6 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMP Global Technologies, an African blockchain-based video entertainment platform, has raised a $5.6 million seed round.\n\nOne interesting tidbit is that the startup received $3 million in funding from friends, family, and angel investors. It also raised $2.6 million from VCs, led by MaC Venture Capital.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d like to be wealthy enough to invest in my family\u2019s and friends\u2019 businesses. So in case you have any generational wealth you\u2019d like to share with me, I\u2019ll accept it with all joy because I want to start investing right away. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nJokes apart, Derrick Ashong (CEO) founded the company behind the Take Back The Mic (TBTM) app.\n\nWhat\u2019s the app about? It\u2019s an interactive content platform that allows content producers to build a direct relationship with their audience and rewards viewers for their participation. So, the app is used by upcoming rappers, artists, and actors.\n\nHow does it work? Fans exchange points for AMP\u2019s digital currency, Kola, built on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, to buy mobile data.\n\nThus, exchanging points helps AMP reach a large audience of young people online to stream its shows.\n\nAMP Global plans to use this funding to launch its Gateway to the Internet programme, which will allow users to purchase mobile data using its blockchain-based digital currency earned through engagement with content in the\n\nTBTM app.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer.

LiveBIc won the star prize of $10,000 for developing a new platform for content creators to market and deliver their content.\n\nSprayme clinched the second position and $4,000 prize money for innovating a new way for social gifting and content monetization; Reelbuzz emerged the third winner with $3,000 for creating an intuitive platform that helps brands connect and command higher brand loyalty; Innovatoras took the fourth position as well as $2,000 prize money for directing the leads for businesses and turning them to paying customers and Monify Cookies, fifth position with $1,000 for developing a browser tool that provides its users the ability to block all unsolicited ads and earn money from allowed ads.\n\nThe winners and runners-up will also get working space at Eko Innovation Centre, while all ten (10) finalists will have access to join the EIC accelerator program and GITEX Global pitch event in Dubai.\n\nRecall, that the best 10 teams with the most viable concepts went head-to-head at the finale for the $20,000 prize pool and an acceleration programme with up to $50K equity investment to get their products ready for the market among other benefits.\n\nSpeaking on the initiative and what inspired it, Victor Afolabi, Founder, of Eko Innovation Centre, and Curator MarkHack 1.0 said, MarkHack 1.0 is a gathering of innovators, entrepreneurs, Policymakers, and Marketing Professionals, to create solutions to real-life Marketing challenges in an intense period of time. Using creativity, technology, and mentoring, resulting in prototypes, fresh new concepts, and innovative usages of tech for Marketing and Media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Country representative of the Dubai World Trade Centre, Akande Ojo; President, National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria, Idorenyen Enang; Lagos State Commissioner for Science and Technology, Hakeem Popoola Fahm; Founder of Eko Innovation Centre and Curator of MarkHack 1.0, Victor Afolabi; Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Innovation and Technology, Tunbosun Alake, at the closing ceremony and Gala-night of the maiden edition of the media and marketing Hackathon tagged \u201cMarkHack 1.0\u2033 organized by Eko Innovation Centre and GDM Group which was held in Lagos recently.\n\n\n\nHe added that \u201cSeeing how technology has disrupted global industries all over the world, we perceived that the marketing and media industry was ripe for disruption. However, they are two things, it is either we collaborate with stakeholders in the industry to create the disruption we anticipate or we allow disruption to happen to us, and we choose to do the former.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe former involves working with over 100 organisations and representatives from the various organisations to co-create together and disrupt that which we anticipate.

          "title": "Businesses face higher loan costs on CBN\u2019s rate hike",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s first interest rate hike in six years will increase the borrowing costs of businesses in the short-term and may fail to address surging inflation in isolation.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on Tuesday, joined global central banks in raising benchmark interest rates to curtail rising inflation and stimulate foreign portfolio inflows (FPI).\n\nThe rate was raised by 150 basis points to 13 percent.\n\nThe implication of this is that the cost of borrowing by businesses, from manufacturers to small and medium-scale firms, will increase as banks reprice their assets and loans, according to analysts.\n\n\u201cWhat the recent rate hike means for the economy is that the cost of credit to the few beneficiaries of the bank credits will increase which will impact their operating costs, prices of their products and profit margins,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, founder/CEO of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, an economic and business advocacy think tank.\n\n\u201cInvestors in fixed income instruments may also benefit from the hike. However, there would be some adverse effects on the equities market,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe decision to hike rates, which was unanimously taken by members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) after a two-day meeting in Abuja, was targeted at curtailing rising inflation and to support the output growth, Godwin Emefiele, governor of CBN, said.\n\nThe apex bank retained the asymmetric corridor around the MPR at +100 /-700 basis points, Cash Reserve Ratio at 27.4 percent, and Liquidity Ratio at 30 percent.\n\nThe rate hike, which caught some analysts by surprise, may not have the desired impact on inflation but will definitely increase the cost of capital of businesses, according to Taiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC.\n\n\u201cGiven that inflation in Nigeria is largely driven from the supply side rather than excess money supply, the impact of the rate hike in pushing down inflation may be marginal while it could have more impact on growth,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\n\u201cCost of capital will rise, thereby putting more pressure on the margins of businesses and their ability to expand. This is also likely to increase the debt service cost of government,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inflation rate jumped to 16.82 percent in April, the highest in eight months amid rising food and diesel prices.\n\nOn his part, Tope Fasua, CEO of Global Analytics, said the rate hike would slow down economic growth. He said manufacturers and producers would come for CBN\u2019s neck because banks would hike borrowing rates, adding that the attempt was to slow down inflation but it may also be ineffective because of weak transmission mechanisms in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn nearby Ghana, consistent hikes in their policy rates to about 19 percent have not slowed down inflation which is in the mid 20 percent. Sub-Saharan African economies must be managed with different thinking, else we continue to sink into despair. Taken together with what\u2019s happening on the global scene perhaps, this is the onset of another global recession,\u201d Fasua said.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, MD/chief business officer, Optimus by Afrinvest, said: \u201cThe rate hike is a surprise, especially with the magnitude and a major drift from the previous stance of the CBN.\n\n\u201cRaising MPR will not necessarily translate into increased FPIs due to the FX challenges. This will lead to high cost of borrowing for firms and the government. As a result, it would lead to higher cost of production and higher inflation rate,\u201d he said.\n\nAyodele Akinwunmi, relationship manager, corporate banking at FSDH Merchant Bank Limited, said: \u201cI think it is a necessary decision the MPC needs to make at this point, given happenings around the world and the rising inflation rate in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said although fragile, the economy seemed to be on a path of growth, given the Q1 2022 GDP figures released this week.\n\n\u201cHowever, the rising inflation rate needs some policy attention now so that it is not growth retarding,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: For first time in six years, CBN hikes rate to 13%\n\nAccording to Akinwunmi, the rising yields and interest rate hikes in other advanced economics may likely have negative impact on the Nigerian economy, both on the exchange rate and inflation rate if nothing is done now.\n\n\u201cPressure on the exchange rate by maintaining a policy regime that is not in tune with reality, given the global economic environment, will cause problems for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe increase in the CBN\u2019s benchmark interest rate will mean that banks will begin to reprice their assets and have broader investment opportunities according to analysts.\n\n\u201cThe beneficiaries of interest rate hike globally tend to be the banks because the banks do better when interest rates are high,\u201d Nnamdi Nwizu, co-managing partner/head of trading at Comercio Partners Limited, said.\n\nAccording to him, it gives the banks high opportunity to raise their interest rates on loans, and also government securities most probably will start to move up, which naturally will give banks the opportunity to invest much higher level than they were now.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the Treasury bill rate is trading at 5 percent and we expect that with this hike and possibly more hikes in the future, we will see those rates move up which naturally will give banks broader investment outlets,\u201d Nwizu said.\n\nLooking at it from the growth aspect, Bismarck Rewane, managing director of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, said: \u201cYou will see some manufacturers who have built capacity two to three years ago in the brewing and cement space take advantage of growth but my biggest fear is that there may be a need to look at the wages again.\n\n\u201cWhat can Nigeria do to adjust wage structure to make it competitive and not actually fuel inflation? This is a practical example of what is called a monetary policy trilemma and that is where we are,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The naira on Tuesday gained 0.32 percent against the dollar at the official market after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time in six years.\n\nAfter trading on Tuesday, the naira closed at N419.00 per dollar as against the last close of N420.33 on Monday, data from the FMDQ indicated.\n\nThe naira also strengthened against the dollar at the parallel market popularly called the black market as it gained N2 or 0.33 percent to close at N608 per dollar from N610 the previous day, traders told BusinessDay.\n\nThe CBN, by unanimous vote after the two days Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, raised the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 150 basis points to 13 percent, the first time in six years.\n\nThe committee believes that tightening would help moderate the inflationary pressure and exchange rate depreciation as well as moderate the speed of capital flow reversals, provide an incentive for foreign capital inflows, and sustain remittances.\n\nFurthermore, tightening could moderate the FGN\u2019s domestic borrowing as the government debt-service-to-revenue ratio has increased considerably in recent times and threatens debt sustainability.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inflation rose to 16.82 percent in April 2022, which was 0.9 percent points higher than the 15.92 percent recorded in the previous month of March 2022.\n\nReacting to the CBN\u2019s decision, Razia Khan, managing director, chief economist, Africa and Middle East Global Research at Standard Chartered Bank, said, \u201cGiven the speed of acceleration in Nigerian CPI inflation, we had forecast a \u2018token\u2019 50 bps hike, but the CBN has delivered much more than this with its 150 bps hike \u2013 which has the appearance of much more than just a token move,\u201d Khan said.\n\n\u201cThe obvious question here is whether this might be the precursor to a Foreign Exchange (FX) policy that might make today\u2019s tightening that much more effective. This could be the most important signal yet of eventual FX policy intentions,\u201d Khan said.\n\nRead also: CBN disowns statement on withdrawal of naira notes from circulation\n\nThe decision to hike rates was majorly driven by the goal of achieving price stability amidst economic growth and keeping foreign investors in the economy, analysts at Cowry Asset Management said.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.11 percent (year-on-year) in real terms in the first quarter of 2022, showing a sustained positive growth for six consecutive quarters since the recession witnessed in 2020 when negative growth rates were recorded in quarter two and three of 2020, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Monday.\n\nAccording to the analysts, with the current inflation rate at 16.82 percent and previous MPR benchmark at 11.50 percent there has been a disparity that will deter foreign portfolio investments and this has forced the Central bank to raise rates to attract foreign investors and cope with the rising inflation.\n\nA higher MPR of 13.00 percent will better compensate and aid foreign investors in hedging against Nigeria\u2019s galloping inflation rate and depreciation of the naira.",

          "text": "Terrorists who kidnapped passengers on an Abuja-Kaduna train on March 28, have released yet another video threatening to kill the victims.\n\nSix passengers, including a Pakistani, were seen in the footage. Ttraumatised, they appealed to the government to come to their aid.\n\n\u201cMy name is Mohammed, I\u2019m working here in Nigeria, but a foreign national, a Pakistani. We were abducted from the Abuja-Kaduna train on 28 March. We are here; 62 in number,\u201d one victim said.\n\n\u201cThe conditions are not very good. I am appealing to the government of Nigeria; the government of Pakistan and the international community to help us.\u201d\n\nAnother passenger, Mohammed Dehu, also appealed to the government to accede to the demands of the abductors.\n\nThe terrorists, accused the government of being insincere, and gave a five-day ultimatum for the release of some of their children whom they claimed were in custody.\n\nThe terrorists had on Monday vowed to start killing the abducted passengers in seven days\n\nLeader of the terrorists Abu Barra spoke on phone to the spokesman of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, Malam Tukur Mamu, \u2018And Dan Iyan Fika.\n\nIn the audio of the conversations between Malam Tukur Mamu and the leaders of the terrorists, the terrorists claimed that the federal government suspended the resumption of the train service because of their threats,\n\n\u201dThe government suspended the resumption of the train service indefinitely because of our threats and we repeat, if our conditions are not met, the resumption of the train service is to the detriment of the government and the passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need money. We have a good reason for doing what we did, until our demands are met none of the victims will come out alive even if it means we all die with them. They are well taken care of as you can see from the pictures we sent to you via WhatsApp but we assure you that this will not continue\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe choose you (Tukur Mamu) to convey this important message to the government, the families of the victims and Nigerians in general because we believe you won\u2019t alter our message and we have seen you severally with Sheikh Gumi in the forest, therefore, we recognized the fearlessness in you\u201d.\n\nAbu Barra said that it\u2019s been two months since the abduction and anything can happen to the abducted passengers henceforth.\n\nHe explained their reasons for the abduction as a retaliation for the arrest and detention of their children by the security agencies.\n\n\u201cOur children numbering about 8 between the ages of one to seven years are currently being held at an orphanage in Jimeta, Adamawa State under the supervision of the Nigerian Army\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe names of our children are; Abdulrahman, Bilkisu, Usman, Ibrahim and Juwairiyyah. They were forcefully taken from our wives in Nasarawa and taken to the orphanage in Yola\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor any continued discussion on the release of these passengers and a safe resumption of the train service, our children must be released unconditionally. Only then we will release some of the abducted victims, especially the women while other passengers will be released on a prisoner exchange with some of our arrested comrades by the government, he continued.\n\nAbu Barra said that the pictures of the passengers they sent earlier, were among some of the pictures they sent to the negotiation team of the government as proof of the well being of the victims. They said since then the government had been lacklustre.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarra said they decided to come to a GSM enabled location with one of the female victims to talk to Malam Mamu and as a confirmation of their claims. Mamu said he could hear her cries with a very low voice that probably indicates exhaustion pleading with him to please talk to the government on their behalf for a swift intervention on their release.\u201d\n\nHe threatened that, if within seven days the government does not respond to their demands, they will stop feeding the victims and will start slaughtering them one after the other and if the government doesn\u2019t respond after that, then Nigerians should forget using the Abuja-Kaduna rail line as well as the Kaduna-Abuja high way.\n\n\u201cIf the government decided not to respond so be it. We are warning Nigerians, especially those that are patronizing the train that if this matter is not resolved peacefully, the day they decided to attack us or do anything funny, passengers or commuters should forget to use the train or follow the Abuja-Kaduna road because we will be consistent and they can\u2019t stop us. We believe that you will deliver this message as it is\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we rely on you and urged you to convey this important message to everyone\u201d, Abu Barra said.\n\nMalam Tukur Mamu replied that he understands the predicament of the government in resolving the abduction imbroglio but stated that every responsible government will look into saving innocent passengers\u2019 lives and make painful compromises where necessary even if it\u2019s against the policy of the administration.\n\nMalam Mamu then explained that prisoner exchange with known criminals on matters of national interest is a global practice and has happened in many developed countries like the United States.\n\nHe stressed the need to avoid any military action that will lead to collateral damage and the loss of innocent lives.\n\n\u201cTime is not on our side, the government must understand that they are dealing with persons with a misguided ideology and tainted religious belief. These people are not scared of death, they seem to believe that they are martyrs when they die. It will be a serious mistake to take this threat lightly. I believe an opportunity has been created for us to explore to save the lives of those innocent victims.\n\n\u201cFor me, if these innocent will regain their freedom because of my involvement and provided that will lead to relative peace and security on our highways and rail lines I wouldn\u2019t mind if I die in the process. We must accept the fact that security alone on the Abuja-Kadunvictima highways remains more fragile than ever and the solution is not militarily alone, especially in a country where impending attacks can hardly be dictated and stopped\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, family members of the victims have made several appeals to the Federal Government to rescue their loved ones from captivity.\n\nLast week, Special Assistant to President Muahmmadu Buhari on Media, Garba Shehu, said negotiations were ongoing to ensure the release of the victims.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe\u2019re aware that there has been resistance from the family members of those who have been taken captive. Of course this is expected. This acts as a pressure on one of the people involved in the discussion with the terrorists to ensure a safe release of those that have been held.\n\n\u201cThe position of government has been stated and restated over time that the success of any operation will be determined by the number of recoveries of human beings alive and well not the return of dead bodies. The government has spoken about the fact that negotiations are ongoing, although a bit difficult, but we hope that we return to normalcy.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) had announced a resumption of activities on the Abuja-Kaduna corridor, but it was later suspended indefinitely.",

Jidda urged all stakeholders to abide by the provisions of all enabling international instruments as provided for by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adding that the Convention for Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 and the International Convention on Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Damage 1992 which Nigeria is signatory to remains relevant to the growth and development of the Nigerian maritime sector.\n\n\u201cNigeria has domesticated these Conventions and we are qualified to reap the benefits therein. We at NIMASA have a register for contributing oil receivers in Nigeria. We urge all stakeholders to play their part to ensure reports emanating from Nigeria are in line with acceptable standards\u201d. \u201cIt is good we have a record as a contributing oil receiver and because it is our obligation to ensure we give the IOPC Fund, the names of all contributing oil receivers in Nigeria. NIMASA is committed to ensuring Nigerians enjoy all the benefits from being signatory to these International Conventions.\u201d The DG said.\n\nDr Jamoh reaffirmed the importance of the conventions to Nigeria\u2019s Marine Environment Management. He said the facilitation of domestication by NIMASA led to the constitution of the National Standing Committee (NSC) on IOPC Fund in September 2004 and five other Sub-Committees in October 2016, with a mandate to ensure seamless implementation of both conventions.\n\nThe five subcommittees include the Sub-Committee on Fish Stock/Fisheries; Sub-Committee on Identification of Receivers of Contributing Oil; Sub-Committee on Compilation of Oil Report; Sub-Committee on Claims Handling and Sub-Committee on Pricing Index.\n\nThe objective of the meeting was to deliberate on the resolutions reached at the 6th meeting including; the development of a roadmap on the establishment of a Local Oil Pollution Compensation Fund by local insurance companies; drawing up national guidelines on fish stock/fisheries, as well as the collation of recent data on Contributing Oil Receivers and Contributing Oil Products imported. Other resolutions include drawing up National Guidelines on fish stock/fisheries; collation of recent data on contributing oil receivers, contributing oil products imported, and quantity of product and details of coastal movement of Low Pour Fuel Oils (LPFO) and High Pour Fuel Oils (HPFO) from the refineries and condensates as well as distribution of COR-1 Forms and carrying out sensitization programmes.",

          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission, has said the identity management system being developed by the capital market would tackle the lingering identity management issues while allowing room for scalability as technology evolves.\n\nThis was stated by the director-general of SEC, Mr Lamido Yuguda when he received members of the committee on identity management for the capital market in Abuja at the weekend, a statement by the agency said.\n\nIdentity theft is a fraudulent practice of using another person\u2019s name and personal information to obtain shares, credit and loans, among others. He said the commission decided to engage relevant stakeholders in a bid to resolve issues of identity management to tackle the problem of unclaimed dividends.\n\nAccording to him, the problem of unclaimed dividends had to do with identity management, hence the Commission is currently engaging stakeholders to harmonize various databases of investors and facilitate data accuracy in the market as well as increasing investors\u2019 education to stem the trend.\n\nThe SEC DG who expressed satisfaction with the work of the Committee so far, added that stakeholder engagements would commence in earnest to ensure success of the project.\n\nIn his remarks, chairman of the committee, Mr Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede commended the commission on the recent release of rules on Issuance, offering platforms and custody of digital assets saying that it was a step in the right direction.\n\nMr Aig-Imoukhuede said the Committee\u2019s work had exposed the need for standardization of systems within the Nigerian Capital Market that would support open finance which SEC can drive, adding that the SEC could leverage on the Committee to develop the framework for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nAccording to Mr. Aig-Imoukhuede \u201cThe Committee had clearly defined the task ahead in a Road Map and also identified that the Project would be carried out in stages supported by a consultant with recourse to the SEC on a regular basis. The Committee is committed to ensuring that the customer journey for investors is such that would cause a revolution in the Nigerian capital market, thereby making our market attractive to the tech savvy and younger generation\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian Capital Market has been on a journey of innovation to drive an efficient capital market that would greatly impact the Nigerian economy. The SEC had identified that lack of a proper identity management system for the Nigerian capital was a plague in attaining its goal of efficiency and reducing the lingering issues surrounding identity management such as unclaimed dividends and cumbersome customer journeys. In order to proffer a lasting solution that would ensure competitiveness of the Capital Market through processes and practices that improve efficiency, enhance participation of both domestic and foreign investors and resolve the protracted issue of unclaimed dividend, the Committee on Identity Management for the Capital Market was constituted by the SEC on June 30, 2021.\n\nMembership was drawn across the Capital Market, banking, payment system and technology/innovation enabler with the SEC as the secretariat. The committee is chaired by Mr Aig-Imoukhuede. Members include Mr Bayo Olugbemi, Mr Haruna Jalo-Waziri, Mr Oladele Sotubo, Mr Saheed Bashir, Mr Herbert Wigwe, Mr Premier Oiwoh and Mr Adedeji Olowe. It is tasked with a high level Terms of Reference (ToR) that would address legacy issues caused by lack of proper identity management system for the Nigerian Capital Market. It is also to facilitate data accuracy and ease of participation in the capital market.",

          "text": "\u2026\u2019My campaign strategy issue-based, not violence-induced\u2019 \u2014 gov\n\n\u2026as Oyetola receives over 150 defectors in Boluwaduro LGA\n\nAs the campaign train of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the forthcoming governorship election in Osun, moved to Boluwaduro Local Government Area, the traditional rulers in the Council, have reaffirmed their unflinching support for the Governor, saying they would do all within their powers to get him re-elected.\n\nThe traditional rulers led by the Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju , Oba Lukman Fadipe and the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun, said the modest achievements of the Governor had earned him second term, insisting that any attempt for the State to decide otherwise would be suicidal to the future of Osun.\n\nThis is even as the Governor maintained that his campaign strategy would continue to be issue based and development driven so as to consolidate on the gains recorded so far and set the State to the path of socioeconomic rejuvenation.\n\nSpeaking in his palace where other traditional rulers across the Council assembled, Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe, said the indelible imprints of the Governor would speak for his re-election as, according to him, the governor has performed creditably well to transform the State.\n\nOba Fadipe who described the administration of Governor Oyetola as unprecedented, said he has been tested and trusted and is therefore qualified for a second term so that he can take the State to enviable heights.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlease continue with your good works. We are satisfied with what God has made you to do within three and a half years. You have convinced us beyond reasonable doubt and done so much beyond expectations.\n\n\u201cYour style of governance is unique. You have been running an all-inclusive and people-oriented governance.\n\n\u201cYou are a calm, cool, collected and calculative man who has been silently achieving great things and squeezing water out of solid rocks.\n\n\u201cWe know what is accruable to the State in terms of resources but despite this obvious reality, your government has not disappointed us or left anyone in doubt of your capacity to achieve great with little.\n\n\u201cYou have proved that it is only an empty barrel that makes noise. Your campaign slogan is speaking for you already. That is why your achievement knows no bounds.\n\n\u201cAs traditional rulers, we are good assessors. We have assessed your achievements and we are satisfied with all you have done.\n\n\u201cWe have seen integrity personified in you. We have seen Omoluabi ethos par excellence in you, and your calmness and integrity have endeared you to many.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to you all to support him wholeheartedly because he deserves to be re-elected\u201d.\n\nCorroborating, the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun, lauded the Governor for being faithful to his electoral promises made to the people of the State, saying he has justified the people\u2019s mandate.\n\nOba Adeseun said the good works of the Governor are clear testimonies to the fact that the Governor merits second term, noting that seeking an alternative to him is suicidal to the future of the State.\n\n\u201cYou have demonstrated good intentions in all you do, and you have been tested, trusted and you are worthy of re-election for second term. Just ride on, we have confidence in you and firm belief that you will win and get re-elected. To us, you have done excellently well, and as traditional rulers, what you have done particularly for traditional rulers in Osun, no one or no Governor has done it in the history of this State.\n\n\u201cYour achievement has surpassed what we have experienced in the past. We don\u2019t know where you have been getting money to run the affairs of the State. You have proved to us that you are a financial wizard and an economy expert. You have done beyond expectations. We will do all within our power to get you returned.\n\n\u201cThough we are expected to be apolitical, in actual sense, we are all political animals. You are our choice and choice of the people of Osun. An alternative to you is suicidal to the future of our great State\u201d, the monarch added.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd of the party loyalists at the St. Thomas, Otan-Ayegbaju, the campaign venue, Governor Oyetola promised to consolidate his modest achievements and improve on them in his second term.\n\nHe warned members of the opposition parties to be cautious, saying campaign and election are not about violence.\n\nGovernor Oyetola who expressed surprise at the attack on the members of the press and loyalists of the party shortly after his campaign at Gbongan yesterday, said it was unfortunate that the opposition had resulted to violence.\n\nHe appealed to the members of the party not to panic just as he called on the security operatives to go after the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\n\u201cI am surprised at the attack that occurred shortly after I left the venue of the campaign yesterday. I am appealing to the people to remain calm and unperturbed as we are doing everything possible to maintain peace and order.\n\n\u201cWe have charged the security agencies to go after the perpetrators. Osun is known for peace and we will continue to maintain that status no matter what. Violence will not help any one or take anyone anywhere. I have been tested and trusted.

Governor Oyetola has within three and a half years of his administration built a solid foundation, set Osun on the path of socioeconomic and infrastructural development and made indelible imprints and legacies that are too big for a toddler to consolidate\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "The immediate past Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu and incumbent Minority leader at the Senate Enyinnaya Abaribe on Wednesday withdrew from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship primary elections in Enugu and Abia states.\n\nSpeaking through a statement by the Director-General of Ikeoha Campaign Organisation, Hon. Charles Ogbo Asogwa, Ekweremadu who did not give reason for his withdrawal, said, \u201cWe wish to inform our supporters and Nigerians that the former Deputy President of the Senate and foremost governorship aspirant in Enugu State, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, will not be participating in the PDP governorship primary election scheduled for this Wednesday, May 25, 2022.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we continue to trust God as we appreciate our teeming supporters and the good people of Enugu state for the enormous goodwill they have ceaselessly invested in the actualisation of the \u201cPathway to a New Enugu State.\n\n\u201cWe urge them to remain peaceful and be assured that we will keep them abreast of our decision on the way forward.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Abaribe alleged that the party has refused to create a level-playing field for all aspirants, hence, his reason for withdrawing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe last couple of weeks has been tortuous as we battled hard to navigate our party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) away from a self-destructive path.\n\n\u201cThe essence was to create an unfettered democratic space and a level playing field for all aspirants vying for all elective offices in the state, to participate equally in the primary elections.\n\n\u201cThat was not the case and of course what we are witnessing is a shambolic process driven by a procured court injunction.\n\n\u201cTo make matters worse, the use of only imaginary 3-man Adhoc delegates to the exclusion of the party\u2019s statutory delegates in the primary elections to elect our candidates even when INEC the nation\u2019s electoral umpire, has unequivocally stated that no congress held in Abia State for that purpose, has no doubt put the party and her candidates in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cThe implication for our party is grave and as such has put all ongoing primary exercises on quicksand.\n\n\u201cI am known for standing firm in defence of my convictions for the right of all people to a free and fair democratic process. That was why my campaign set sail on a democratic journey that took us to all the nooks and crannies of our dear state. We covered all the local governments and we could see the enthusiasm on the faces of our people who are desirous of change to a progressive government with a human face.\n\n\u201cWe committed human and material resources, preaching the \u201cRise Up Abia\u201d message for the total emancipation of our State from the drudgery of imposition and godfatherism, which has seen the state at the lowest wrung of infrastructural, human and material development index among the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cOur people were and are indeed fired up for a new lease of life that will be brought about by a people\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThere was no doubt that Abians are tired of being subjected to being the butt of jokes and ridicule from their peers, particularly those from the contiguous states that were hitherto far behind Abia State in the development index in the time past. That was the narrative we sought to change when the campaign took off.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the ugly developments ignited by a rapacious ambition to maintain the wicked governance status quo of imposition and godfatherism have aborted this quest in PDP.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe will not be part of this charade. I am therefore withdrawing from the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship primary election that holds in Abia State on Wednesday 25th of May, 2022 as doing so would have amounted to an endorsement of illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, ask all our people, our teeming supporters and Ndigbo to remain calm, keep the faith and wait for the new direction, which will be announced very soon.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that the campaign to liberate Abia State would surely assume a new dimension. The time is now.\n\n\u201cThank you for always being there for me and the campaign. Together we shall triumph.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",
          "summary": "Deputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\nHe added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities.\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

The one on NITDA is testing the three platforms, the government\u2019s Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) of ASUU, and the Universities Peculiar Personnel Payroll System (UPPPS) of the non-teaching staff.\n\n\u201cThey started the testing last Thursday. The National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) has issued their amendment circulars. The unions also have copies to take care of responsibility and hazard allowances wherever it has not been properly captured.\n\nNgige assured Nigerians that there may likely be wage adjustments as the government intensifies efforts to streamline wages through the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission.\n\n\u201cWe have done that of the Police, for example. It wasn\u2019t envisaged that we should do it in bits. But you can see that it has been done. You can also see university teachers saying that their own should be done immediately, since we have done police. So, something is being done. It was part of the 2009 negotiation they had with the government then. So, the committee of Prof. Briggs is on it, discussing with the university unions and their employer, the Federal Ministry of Education. They will bring up something for government to see.\n\n\u201cThere are other people. The doctors are complaining about brain drain, this and that. Their hazard allowance has to be touched and it was touched by close to 300 percent. From N5,000 paid across board for each person, the least person in the health sector is getting N15,000 while the big ones are getting N45,000. That is a quantum leap.\u201d\n\nThe minister appealed to ASUU and other university-based unions once more to suspend their strike so that academic activities could resume in public universities across the country.",

          "text": "A teenage gunman killed at least 19 young children and two teachers at an elementary school in Texas on Tuesday, prompting a furious President Joe Biden to denounce the US gun lobby and vow to end the nation\u2019s cycle of mass shootings.\n\nThe attack in Uvalde \u2014 a small community about an hour from the Mexican border \u2014 was the deadliest US school shooting in years and the latest in a spree of bloody gun violence across America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to turn this pain into action for every parent, for every citizen of this country,\u201d Biden said, his voice heavy with emotion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for those who obstruct or delay or block common-sense gun laws \u2014 we need to let you know that we will not forget,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we have to ask when in God\u2019s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God\u2019s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?\u201d\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, addressing an earlier news conference, named the suspect as Salvador Ramos, an 18-year-old local resident, and a US citizen.\n\n\u201cHe shot and killed, horrifically and incomprehensibly,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nTexas Department of Public Safety officials told CNN the gunman is believed to have shot his grandmother before heading to Robb Elementary School around noon where he abandoned his vehicle and entered with a handgun and a rifle, wearing body armor.\n\nREAD ALSO: Two Years After George Floyd\u2019s Murder, Biden To Sign Executive Order On Police Reform\n\nMore Than Dozen Children Wounded\n\nThe gunman was killed by responding officers, the officials said, adding later two teachers also died in the attack.\n\n\u201cRight now there\u2019s 19 children that were killed by this evil gunman, as well as two teachers from this school,\u201d DPS spokesman Lieutenant Chris Olivarez told NBC News.\n\nMore than a dozen children were also wounded in the attack at the school, which teaches more than 500, mostly Hispanic and economically disadvantaged students.\n\nUvalde Memorial Hospital said on Facebook it had received 13 children while University Health hospital in San Antonio said on Twitter it had received a 66-year-old woman and a 10-year-old girl, both in critical condition, and two other girls aged nine and 10.\n\nAt least one Border Patrol agent responding to the incident was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with the shooter, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Espinosa tweeted.\n\nFootage showed small groups of children weaving through parked cars and yellow buses, some holding hands as they fled under police escort from the school, which teaches students aged around seven to 10 years old.\n\nIt was the deadliest such incident since the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut, in which 20 children and six staff were killed.\n\nThe White House ordered flags to be flown at half-mast in mourning for the victims \u2014 whose deaths sent a wave of shock through a country still scarred by the horror of Sandy Hook.\n\n\u2018Happens Nowhere Else\u2019\n\nTed Cruz, a pro-gun rights Republican senator from Texas, tweeted that he and his wife were \u201clifting up in prayer the children and families in the horrific shooting in Uvalde.\u201d\n\nBut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Sandy Hook shooting took place, made an impassioned appeal for concrete action to prevent further violence.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t inevitable, these kids weren\u2019t unlucky. This only happens in this country and nowhere else. Nowhere else do little kids go to school thinking that they might be shot that day,\u201d Murphy said on the Senate floor in Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here on this floor to beg, to literally get down on my hands and knees and beg my colleagues: Find a path forward here. Work with us to find a way to pass laws that make this less likely.\u201d\n\nThe deadly assault in Texas follows a series of mass shootings in the United States this month.\n\nOn May 14, an 18-year-old man shot 10 people dead at a Buffalo, New York grocery store.\n\nWearing heavy body armor and wielding an AR-15 rifle, the self-declared white supremacist livestreamed his attack, having reportedly targeted the store because of the large surrounding African American population.\n\nThe following day, a man blocked the door of a church in Laguna Woods, California, and opened fire on its Taiwanese-American congregation, killing one person and wounding five.\n\nDespite recurring mass-casualty shootings, multiple initiatives to reform gun regulations have failed in the US Congress, leaving states and local councils to strengthen \u2014 or weaken \u2014 their own restrictions.\n\nThe National Rifle Association has been instrumental in fighting against stricter US gun laws. Abbott and Cruz are listed as speakers at a forum that is being held by the powerful lobby in Houston, Texas later this week.\n\nThe United States suffered 19,350 firearm homicides in 2020, up nearly 35 percent compared to 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest data.\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Jim Nwobodo backs Peter Mbah to succeed Gov Ugwuanyi",
          "text": "Former Governor of old Anambra State and Senator, Jim Ifeanyichukwu Nwobodo, has endorsed the candidature of Peter Mbah as the governorship candidate of the PDP in Enugu State.\n\nIn his statement Senator Nwobodo described Peter Mbah as a quintessential technocrat with a calm disposition to cope with the rigours of governance.\n\nNwobodo who is easily the one of the oldest experienced politician of his era observed that Peter Mbah\u2019s candour and upwardly mobile experience fits the cap of a personality to galvanize the entities of the State and improve on the economic potentials of the State.\n\nThis came after months of speculations on who will take over from Governor Ugwuanyi in 2023.\n\nBut in less than 24 hours to the governorship primary election, Nwobodo has now revealed that Mbah is the chosen one.\n\nHe broke the news during a press conference at his Amaechi country home, where he also disclosed that another aspirant, Senator Ike Ekweremadu has accepted to support Mba.\n\nHe said he held a meeting with a number of the aspirants from Enugu East for a conversation on how to develop Enugu State.\n\n\u201cThe former governor said, \u201cI don\u2019t usually call for this kind of press conference, but when something when something very important happens, I\u2019d be forced to do so. I jotted a few things down and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll take questions eventually. Ladies and gentlemen I know I\u2019ve addressed you a couple of times about my strong belief that the Governor of Enugu State should come from Nkanu East.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not from Nkanu East but I\u2019m from Nkanu and I know before I come to the main issue, I had invited a number of young men from Enugu East Senatorial Zone for a conversation on how to develop Enugu State. I did that bcos I know there is an understanding among the people of Enugu state that governorship should rotate amongst the three Senatorial zones.\n\n\u201cThat there should be a rotation of ownership among the three Senatorial zones. From my interaction with all of them, I looked at a number of them, and many of them I\u2019ve spoken to and talked to them privately and we\u2019ve held meetings and I was looking for somebody whom I think should re develop enugu state the way it was when I left it. I found a young man whom I never met before but we met briefly and he took me to his office and his business and that young man is Peter Mbah. Peter Mbah is not talkative, it\u2019s not being heard here in Enugu state.\n\n\u201cAs far back as October 2019 to be specific, I invited Peter Mbah to my house. When he came I told him young man I told him young men should consider running for a position in Enugu state in particular the governorship of Enugu state. And I also said, you don\u2019t dwell in the private sector, u have no experience in the government and your from the neglected backward area of Nkanu why not take up this challenge.\n\n\u201cThis was one one of the things that challenged me as a Wawa man to run as governor of old Anambra state when I was 39. I was invited by Zik, the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe to run for the governorship of old Amanda state. And he gave me the reasons. (I\u2019ll come back to that later) Peter Mbah did not say yes or no but said he would give it a thought and came back to me few weeks after and said that he will consider running. So, I said he should go on.\n\n\u201cSince then he has been quietly consulting widely and seeking advice from every important key stakeholder and myself. And based on my experience as the oldest, I repeat, as the oldest politician in Enugu state today and I\u2019m Jim Nwobodo and I don\u2019t know of any politician who is living today who is older than myself both in terms of experience and age. Politicians are very interesting people and they can twist and untwist.\n\n\u201cBut because I\u2019m used to it, I accept when people start claiming what they have not done or what they did. Tomorrow you should be asking why am I keeping quiet?. Tomorrow is the governorship primaries of the PDP and I believe that anybody who wins the primaries of the PDP in Enugu State will be the governor of enugu state. Because this is in fact the only party in Enugu state. PDP is the only part in Enugu state.\n\n\u201cI too have had discussions with people. Those of you who were around last year must have seen the meeting the rally we held organized by Enugu East Senatorial Zone. Enugu East comprises Enugu North LGA, Nkanu East LGA, Nkanu West LGA and Isi-Uzo. Taking about six LGs that make up Enugu East Senatorial Zone. I have also been speaking with the governor of the state, very peaceful man; and I told him, and I believe he heard me, that anybody that will succeed Gburugburu must bring peace, continue with the peace he has set up in Enugu state. We are not going to any war, or into any rascality, or into vandalism and going to handle the government of enugu state peacefully.\n\n\u201cAnd Ugwuanyi has set the pace, comes out\u2026 He looks for nothing but a government job, make me SA, make me SPA\u2026 Make me this or that. But nobody has done anything about working for himself. And any LG or any state of the federation or any country that depends on government will never do well. So we need somebody who will develop the private sector where people can go to do their own work, create\u2026 This is the era of innovation. Start something yourself, run it, make yourself feel proud, don\u2019t depend on government. And this is what I think of very important.\n\n\u201cWhen people say. I don\u2019t know. When people say that I succeeded as Governor, it was because of my experience in the private sector. I had my own company, I built it up. I had branches in London, in Zurich, in USA ask over on my own and it helped me to run the state. If you have no experience in the private sector you would be unable to run a state properly because you\u2019d depend on what you are told by the civil servants. I have heard all kinds of rumors about people claiming they brought\u2026ot I\u2019m sponsoring Peter Mbah.\n\n\u201cI am not going to talk about it because it is unnecessary but I know Peter Mbah also know that. I brought him into this place 2ce in the sense that I started speaking to him about this. I kept quiet because as an elder statesman I don\u2019t need to dangle words with everybody. I know that there will be time to speak. And this is the time to speak. Time to speak because tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow is the D-Day for the primaries. And I plead with all of them that have bought their forms and put their hopes in this thing to get ready for tomorrow. All the delegates who are going, my plea is that you\u2019ll bring a good candidate that you\u2019ll build up Enugu State.\n\n\u201cI speak to the delegates. Since the past one or two weeks I\u2019ve been making peace all over. Ike Ekweremmadu had been here to see me and over been discussing with him about peace. Sang I told him; how can you Ike Ekweremmadu fight against your own party? And I think this is working. I\u2019ve asked him, if they\u2019re is any case in court please withdraw it from the court. Let\u2019s talk peace. Because with peace, you\u2019ll succeed.\n\n\u201cYou see, of you are running a state or any thing, a home if there is no leave you\u2019ll not enjoy it. If in your home you have no peace, you will not enjoy it. So we need peace in Enugu. And that is the legacy the governor of Enugu state Gburugburu has left for us. It is a tall order. So I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m succeeding. For the past five days I have been meeting with Ekweremmadu and I have asked him please collapse your team, you pool, let them join the rest in making enugu state a peaceful state.\n\n\u201cThere are many other people whom I have called\u2026 And I said please, please do not break Enugu State. It is important for you to know that if there is no peace here you pressmen would not be able to practice. If there is no peace in Enugu you would be unable to practice. You be so scared coming out. But outside be to Good that we have a man who has taken the issue of security and peace seriously and who ever is coming out should take peace as important but in\n\naddition build the private sector. I also want to plead with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a plea coming from me, the social media should be kind enough but to abuse and castigate other people, all those people who are older that themselves. I hate to see in the social media all sorts of abuse people who have suffered for enugu state. The social media people should give this people a chance because fantastic lies are written.\n\n\u201cYou could read them and enjoy but because as an old man, I don\u2019t think I would enjoy lies. Perhaps I\u2019m the oldest surviving member of the founders of the PDP, not only in Nigeria but in Enugu state. I\u2019m one of the oldest surviving members. The rest have gone. Since God has kept me alive my job is to talk about peace and unity within the PDP and in Enugu state. Ekweremmadu has been very magnanimous to listen to me and I asked him go and withdraw your cased from court. Go and tell your people; collapse the people\u2026 Let them join the PDP\u2026 I think I\u2019m succeeding. Ekweremmadu also is a major stakeholder in Enugu state, in PDP.\n\n\u201cHe had called down and he is supporting. Two of them have met. Ekweremmadu had met with Peter Mbah and he is supporting Peter Mbah now. As I say this, there may be those who have come to me who also want to be governor of Enugu state but I have not made any thing completely to them because I am looking for somebody who will come in and bring peace. The worst thing that can happen to a state is instability and insecurity.\u201d\n\nOn Ekweremadu\u2019s ambition, Nwobodo said the former Deputy Senate President \u201chas come to see me many times and I told him about the need for peace, I have asked him to withdraw all cases in court so that we talk peace.\n\n\u201cWe need peace in Enugu and that\u2019s the legacy Ugwuanyi is leaving behind.\n\n\u201cI have asked Ekweremadu to collapse his team, let them join the rest in making Enugu to work.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Governor of the State for the way he has piloted the affairs of the State,\u201d he concluded.",

          "text": "The African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA) has said Nigeria and other African countries would need at least $15.7 billion to upgrade existing refineries in their bid to reduce sulphur content.\n\nSpeaking at the second Refining and Specifications Virtual Workshop organised by the ARDA, the association noted that the upgrade was necessary to ensure that Africa embraces cleaner sources of fuels.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of ARDA, Anibor Kragha, noted that adoption of harmonised specification would halt importation of fuels not meeting the AFRI specs into Africa.\n\nIn addition, he explained that it would give existing refineries until 2030 to upgrade their facilities to produce cleaner, lower sulphur AFRI-6 specifications, arguing that targeted financing was urgently needed for projects to upgrade refineries and infrastructure.\n\n\u201cNew process units required are to improve key fuel specifications, especially Naptha Hydrotreater (NHdT), Diesel Hydro-desulph. (DHDS), Benzene Extraction, Sulphur and Hydrogen Plants.\n\n\u201cAnother key focus area is for African countries, especially those sharing common fuel supply chains to develop an integrated policy covering both fuel quality and vehicle exhaust emissions.\n\n\u201cThis is to achieve the ultimate objective of clean air in our African cities. Without this integrated and coordinated policy, the objective of clean air will not be realised whether by imports or local production,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Oil and Refining Research Analyst at Vitol, Maryro Mendez, noted that despite the withdrawal of fund from fossils, investment with sustainability plan had been on the rise.\n\nQuoting Bloomberg statistics, she noted that sustainable debt annual issuance now borders around $824.7 billion as capital raised for renewables funds now dominate the energy sector. According to her, lack of uniform policies make it difficult for refineries to pass on the cost of carbon to customers as carbon price shifts the cost burden of climate change from society as a whole to the entities responsible for the emissions, providing lack of incentive for refiners to reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cThe refining sector accounts for only three per cent of the global energy sector emissions. While refineries contribution to global energy sector emissions is low, the opportunities for reducing them are significant.\n\n\u201cRefineries globally have started thinking about measuring, monitoring and reducing carbon emissions and environmental sustainability has to be a priority for refiners and Africa is no exception,\u201d Mendez said.\n\nShe said 80 per cent of refinery carbon emissions come from fuel combustion, hence fuel source and energy optimisation would present the biggest opportunity to reduce emissions.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is not technical but is commercial with facilities requiring sufficient incentive and capital to invest without impacting on their competitive position,\u201d she added.\n\nSpeaking on, \u201cUpgrading refineries to produce AFRI-6 standard fuels,\u201d Data Manager at CITAC, Richard Augood, said investment was still needed to make African refineries comply with AFRI-6.\n\nFor compliance in the aspect of gasoline, Augood noted that North African countries such as Algeria would need to upgrade its Adrar refinery, while in Egypt, refineries like Amreya would need Benzene extraction.\n\n\u201cIn Libya, Azzawiya would need Benzene extraction, El Brega would need NHT, Benzene extraction while Sarir would need to be upgraded with NHT, Benzene extraction,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn West and Central Africa, Angola, Sonaref refinery needs NHT, benzene extraction as Chad\u2019s SRN needs CGDS and Benzene extraction while Congo\u2019s CORAF needs NHT, Benzene extraction and H2 and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s SIR needs Benzene extraction and H2.\n\nIn Nigeria, Warri, Kaduna and Port Harcourt refineries, he said , would need NHT, CGDS, Benzene extraction while Senegal\u2019s SAR must be upgraded with benzene extraction to meet AFRI Specifications.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Honeywell-UOP\u2019s Luque Guillermo decried that the oil and gas industry has been hit hard by the current global economic situation with rapid drops in demand.\n\nHe added that the changing mix of preferred products, volatile crude prices, and difficulty safely staffing production sites posed a challenge.\n\nThis prevailing development according to him, is forcing demand for some products such as diesel and naphtha to exceed demand for gasoline and jet fuel.\n\nHe said the sector now has to cope with new ways of working which is making workforces to operate remotely.",

Teargas was also used inside Okorocha\u2019s residence by the operatives before whisking him off at 6:41pm, THISDAY gathered.\n\nOperatives of the commission had earlier on Tuesday stormed the Maitama, Abuja residence of Okorocha to effect his arrest. But Okorocha raised the alarm that the siege to his Abuja residence by men of the anti-graft agency was part of a grand plan to truncate his presidential ambition.\n\nThe senator, who addressed journalists inside his room, said the EFCC, which later reinforced and returned with additional men, had threatened to break the doors and forcefully take him away on the day of the APC presidential screening.\n\nOkorocha said, \u201dFrankly speaking, the situation I find myself is what I call hostage. Policemen and EFCC operatives are currently in my compound and possibly to whisk me away and my gate is blocked.\n\n\u201dAll I am asking for now is to allow me to go for my screening because I am a presidential aspirant and our election comes up on Sunday. If I am not allowed to go for this screening, I may miss it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI am not an unknown person in the country. I have an address and people know me in the country. All what it takes for the EFCC is to send me an invitation and I will gladly oblige.\u201d\n\nHowever, a statement issued later by the EFCC stated that the agency was after Okorocha following his refusal to honour an invitation extended to him after jumping bail.\n\nThe statement claimed, \u201cOperatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), today May 24, 2022, arrived at the Maitama, Abuja home of a former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, to effect his arrest.\n\n\u201cThe move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the commission.\u201d\n\nThe statement signed by the spokesman of the commission, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, further said EFCC had on January 24, 2022 filed a 17-count criminal charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9 billion against Okorocha.\n\nIt said the case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, but attempts to arraign Okorocha were twice stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes.\n\nAt the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Ekwo, before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, warned that it was \u201cthe last adjournment I shall grant in this matter,\u201d that statement alleged.\n\nThe agency also stated, \u201cin the circumstances, the commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC team was able to arrest Okorocha at 6:41pm in an operation that started around 10am.",

          "title": "Hayatu-Deen: 2023 Presidential Election is PDP\u2019s to Lose",
          "text": "Former Managing Director of FSB International Bank Plc., and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has said if the main opposition party is able to get its act together in terms of organisation and envisaging the antics of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), PDP would win the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential interview series, Hayatu-Deen, punctured arguments in favour of zoning or power shift. He said it was unreasonable for the country to be bogged down by power shift clamour and debate, stressing that the argument for zoning is not only lazy but also against democratic principles.\n\nHe said if he had been asked the question on zoning some weeks back, he would have loved to spend some quality time on the subject. But PDP had already deferred to wisdom by throwing its presidential ticket open, he stated.\n\nAnalysing the chances of PDP in next year\u2019s general election, Hayatu-Deen, who explained the rationale behind the proposed consensus northern candidate and why it failed, said, \u201cLet me say that the reason for putting in place that framework for producing a consensus candidate from the northern part of the country was informed by two or three reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the field was getting large both in the north and in the south to the point where it would become difficult to manage at the convention.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the election of 2023 is PDP\u2019s to lose and if caution is not exercised, APC may actually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat if we have an acrimonious convention.\n\n\u201cThirdly was that the consensus arrangement was actually going to happen in stages. That the north should reduce the field to one person or maximum of two and, second, that this particular message should actually also be taken to the southern part of the country. At the time, we knew more people were going to come out, but only Pius Anyim had come out as at the time.\n\n\u201cLo and behold, after a few weeks, there were far more contestants in the southern part of the country than the north. So, we now started going to various parts of the country, preaching to the governors of the PDP to do other things in their powers to actually shrink the field in the south so that when we go to the convention, we\u2019ll have few people to narrow this process.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, the consensus arrangement in the north fell apart simply because the candidates felt that the basis for it existed no more and, therefore, it was better for each person to actually run their own independent campaign. In so doing, taking cognisance of two things: that we would be able to establish very good relationships among ourselves.\n\n\u201cAlso, it provided a teaching moment as we go to the convention to begin to put together some kind of framework even before the convention as to how these things will coalesce and still have a very successful convention and produce a candidate. So, those were the reasons.\u201d\n\nDismissing the idea of zoning, Hayatu-Deen stated, \u201cThis issue has been up in the air and travelling at just 1000 miles per hour, it\u2019s now an open and shut case that has gone to the highest policymaking body of the party and they decided to open it up for all. Let me tell you this, first, in 1999, beginning from preparations in 1998, this is now almost 23 to 24 years, there was a major event that took place during MKO Abiola\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cFollowed by a lot of commotion from many places, leading up to 1998, it was decided by the party bigwigs that given what had happened, it was important for us to stabilise this country, to hand over power to somebody from the South-west to compensate the denial of Abiola\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThere was no constitutional provision, there was no referendum taken among the south, and this is how the world works. It was an open contest. People like Abubakar Rimi, Philip Asiodu, and others ran to me and contested about that. That was a private arrangement that was done. So, we were able to organise to shift the votes to Obasanjo. Secondly, it\u2019s now almost a generation and after 23 years, we are still bogged down with power shift. I think it\u2019s unreasonable.\n\n\u201cThirdly, it goes against the principles of democracy as far as I\u2019m concerned. You cannot shut anyone out under a democratic contest. Anybody who is eligible that meets the criteria to either vote for somebody or be voted for, let him go on. I refuse to accept the lazy argument that this thing should be zoned and given to a particular zone.\n\n\u201cAbiola invested almost 20 to 25 years of goodwill across the country. Tofa, who was a very popular person in Kano, lost Kano to Abiola. Anybody from the South-east or South-south or the north, who wants to become president, should go and do that hard work and build alliances. Nigerians are good people. If you show them that you actually have their back and you are waiting for them, you will be amazed.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated further, \u201cIn 1999, a large section of the northern establishment, over 80 per cent of them, who were military were backing Alex Ekwueme for the presidency. As journalists, I will encourage you to send messages to people to actually go out there and build friendship and relationships and sow the seeds.\n\n\u201cYou will be surprised that an Ibibio or an Igbo guy or Ijaw man can easily get elected president, because the democratic space is very free and very open, and it\u2019s all about relationships. That investment has to happen. There is no reason why Mohammed Hayatu-Deen should be prevented from exercising his own democratic and human rights. That\u2019s my answer to that question.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his chances at the PDP presidential primary this weekend, Hayatu-Deen said, \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t go into anything without actually reflecting very carefully about it. Secondly, the reason why I went in is not because I want anything out of it personally for myself, my family or my friends.\n\n\u201cI see this country standing on a brink, almost approaching a failed state. All the sounds and stress are there for who wants to see; the structural holes, the cracks are there for anybody to see. I don\u2019t want to be a bystander watching what is going on, only for my conscience to say, if something terrible happens, what were you doing then?

          "title": "Citing Inflationary Concerns, CBN Raises MPR to 13%, First Increase in 30 Months",
          "text": "After holding the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), on Tuesday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the apex bank lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of funds in the economy.\n\nThe MPC, however, left other monetary policy parameters, including the apex bank\u2019s Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR), unchanged at 27.5 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of the MPC, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, admitted that the hike in MPR would increase cost of borrowing, especially in non-priority sectors of the economy.\n\nEmefiele, however added that lending to key priority sectors, which had been identified to boost growth and generate employment, would remain at single-digit interest rate of nine per cent.\n\nThe central bank governor pointed out that the decision to raise interest rate was the last resort and a difficult one for the MPC, which had been crafting policies to stimulate economic growth as well as achieve financial stability. He said the CBN had adopted a contractionary monetary policy stance in view of the aggressive rise in inflation in recent times, which had led to high food and commodity prices in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that CBN\u2019s action was aimed at curbing inflation, on the one hand, and supporting growth of the economy, on the other. He said the MPC was in a dilemma in arriving at a decision to raise the lending rate. As a result, the apex bank governor explained, a drastic measure such as raising the benchmark lending rate was required to reduce monetary expansion in order to tame inflation.\n\nHe assured that though inflation was expected to maintain an aggressive acceleration in the coming months, the central bank would not hesitate to return to its accommodative stance whenever it saw a reduction in the headline index.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe concerns about the global rise in inflation and price levels; you all would have seen that the price of crude quite unexpectedly has been above $100 per barrel. In fact, Nigeria\u2019s Bonny light yesterday, when we started the meeting, was about $116 per barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the standard pricing indicator; yes, whereas crude prices have gone up per barrel, at the same time the cost of refining and ultimate pump price at the station would naturally have gone up.\n\n\u201cThis is a global phenomenon and I was watching the CNN a few days ago and one of the analysts was talking about an incredible distortion to financial markets in the United States, and I said, yes, we are all welcome to a situation where inflation is rising to unprecedented levels in the US and other economies, growth is also coming down.\n\n\u201cAnd if you must tackle inflation, prices, and at the same time you want growth, then you know that you are faced with some compelling dilemma as to what to do.\n\n\u201cYou like to see inflation come down but at the same time you want growth to go up. But to achieve that, you have to take two decisions that are in opposite directions and that brings to bear what type of skills you have put in place to ensure you are able to manage these two in a way that you maintain a balance when you see a moderation in inflation and at the same time you grow your economy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFor us in Nigeria, you would have observed that in the last two and a half years, what we have been doing is that we want to pursue a policy of price stability that is conducive to growth and that\u2019s why somehow we have used our development finance intervention facilities, we have actually yielded positive results and helped to drive growth in our economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used that to drive growth while at the same time we try as much as possible to maintain a hold position while looking at the optimum level of liquidity in the industry to be able to moderate inflation at a level that does not hurt the growth and economy of our country.\n\n\u201cBut with what we have seen globally either in the areas of the supply chain, increases in prices of petroleum products, and the rest of them, we have seen aggressive growth in inflation in Nigeria between March and April of 2022.\n\n\u201cAnd the forecast from our statisticians, including the NBS and CBN as well as our colleagues in research and monetary policy, is that unless something drastic or significant actions are taken, it will be difficult for us to really rein in inflation if we don\u2019t do something immediately.\n\n\u201cThis decision has been taken because we felt that there may continue in the next couple of months to be an aggressive acceleration in inflation and we think there is a need to take some drastic actions to reverse it.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to see a reversal, perhaps, we can say we are returning to what we can call the normal period, when we are looking at using CRR to moderate inflation and at the same time using our development finance to really push for growth.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the broad outlook for both the global and domestic economies in the medium-term remained clouded with uncertainties arising from the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine, the unfolding impact of the extensive sanctions imposed by several countries on Russia, and the downside risks from the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe added that global growth was confronted with significant headwinds, which might derail the current projection further, adding that the continuing rise in inflation is also set to undermine the recovery of output growth due to the associated build-up of uncertainties around the cost of inventory and other production inputs.\n\nThe CBN governor said the rise in global debt was also an unfolding dilemma, which policymakers must carefully evaluate and address to avert a near-term global financial crisis.\n\nIn summary, he said, while global aggregate demand remained strong and growing, the numerous supply-side constraints would continue to undermine the recovery effort, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nIn the domestic economy, the CBN governor noted that data on key macroeconomic variables indicated that the recovery of output growth will continue, probably at a more subdued pace, considering the unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy.\n\nHe said domestic price development was, however, expected to maintain an upward pressure in light of the build-up of spending related to the 2023 general election.\n\nThe MPC noted the risks confronting the global economy involved not only inflation and prices, but also included risks associated with weakening growth prospects across the world.\n\nThe committee observed that whereas post-pandemic policy support remained broadly expansionary, at least, from a fiscal standpoint, the sharp rise in inflation across both the advanced and emerging markets economies had generated growing concern among central banks, as the progressive rise in inflation, driven by rising aggregate demand and wage growth, was putting unsustainable upward pressure on price levels.\n\nConsequently, Emefiele said, major central banks, such as the US Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada, had provided strong guidance for a progressive shift away from monetary policy accommodation to drive market interest rate upward, which may ultimately impact capital flow away from Emerging Market Economies.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn another hand, MPC noted that the war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in significant disruption of the global supply chain, at a time when the global economy is still confronted with downside risks to growth associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to this, global trade has been impacted by the series of restrictions imposed by NATO countries and its allies against trade with Russia.\n\n\u201cThis has increasingly fragmented the global economy, imposing huge strains on the tepid post-pandemic recovery. Only recently, China, the USA, and South Africa are seeing a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the Chinese government recently re-introduced lockdown in major industrial cities, to forestall the spread of the pandemic, further disrupting the supply chain crisis. In the view of the MPC, these two risks pose great challenges to rising inflation globally.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the CBN governor said on the decision on whether to hold, tighten or loosen, the MPC felt that loosening in the face of the rising policy rates in advanced economies might result in a sharp rise in capital outflow and faster dry-up of foreign credit lines.\n\nEmefiele stated, \u201cMPC also feels that loosening could lead to further liquidity surfeit and inflationary pressure. So as to whether to hold, MPC feels its stance would strengthen the perception that the CBN has abandoned its primary mandate of taming inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the need to tighten, MPC feels that tightening would help moderate the inflationary trade-off from the steady growth recovery so far. MPC also feels that tightening would help rein in inflation before it assumes a galloping trend, considering the progressive increase in headline inflation (m-o-m), particularly with the sharp 90 basis point increase in April 2022.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cFurthermore, MPC feels that tightening would narrow the negative real interest rate margin, improve market sentiment, and restore investor confidence.\n\n\u201cEqually, members believe tightening would moderate inflationary pressure pass-through to exchange rate depreciation and moderate the speed of capital flow reversal, provide incentives for foreign capital inflows, and sustain remittances.\n\n\u201cLastly, tightening could moderate government domestic borrowing, as government debt servicing to revenue ratio increased significantly in recent times, threatening debt sustainability.\u201d\n\nHe said MPC members expressed deep concern about the continued uptrend of inflationary pressure, despite the gradual improvement in output growth.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe committee noted that the current rise in inflation may be inimical to growth and, thus, hinder the full recovery of the economy. While the MPC identified several supply-side factors, which may be contributing to inflationary pressure, emerging evidence shows that money demand pressure is on the rise and is unlikely to abate until the 2023 general elections are concluded.\n\n\u201cThe dilemma confronting the committee at this meeting, therefore, is how best to drive down domestic prices while continuing to support the fragile recovery.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing the developments of the last two months and the outlook for both the domestic and global economies, as well as the benefits and downsides of each policy option, the committee decided to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to rein in the current rise in inflation, as members were of the view that the continued uptrend would adversely affect growth.\u201d\n\nAnalysts React to MPR Hike\n\nCommenting on the MPR adjustment by the CBN, Investment Analyst, Ayodeji Ebo, noted that the rate hike came as a surprise considering the magnitude and a major drift from the previous stance of the CBN. According to him, raising MPR will not necessarily translate to increased foreign portfolio investments due to the foreign exchange challenges.\n\nEbo told THISDAY, \u201cThis will lead to the high cost of borrowing for firms and the government. As a result, lead to a higher cost of production and a higher inflation rate. This will make the stock market less attractive, leading to a downtrend. Also, the fixed income market will be bearish in the interim, as traders try to minimise losses on their portfolios.\u201d\n\nFounder and Chief Executive of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), an economic and business advocacy think tank, Dr. Muda Yusuf, explained that while the hike in MPR by 150 basis points to 13 per cent by the MPC was understandable, \u201cwhether this would significantly impact on the inflation is a different matter.\u201d\n\nYusuf said, \u201cAlready, bank lending has been constrained by the high CRR (many operators in the sector claim that effective CRR is as high as 50 per cent or more for many banks), the discretionary debits by the apex bank, the 65 per cent Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) and liquidity ratio of 30 per cent. The lending situation in the economy is already very tight.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy is not a credit-driven economy, unlike what obtains in many advanced economies, which have much higher levels of financial inclusion, robust consumer credit framework and strong correlation between interest rate and aggregate demand.\n\n\u201cThe level of financial inclusion in the Nigerian economy is still quite low, access to credit by households and MSMEs is still very challenging, and the informal sector accounts for close to 50 per cent of the economy.\u201d\n\nYusuf added, \u201cThe transmission effects of monetary policy on the economy are, therefore, still very weak. In the Nigerian context, price levels are not interest-sensitive. Supply-side issues are much more profound drivers of inflation. What the recent rate hike means for the economy is that the cost of credit to the few beneficiaries of the bank credits will increase, which will impact their operating costs, prices of their products and profit margins. Investors in the fixed income instruments may also benefit from the hike. There would be some adverse effects on the equities market.\u201d\n\nHead, Financial Institutions Ratings at Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi, said the hike was not surprising, considering the rising inflation as well as the tilting of members of the MPC in favour of a hike in rates in previous meetings.\n\nAccording to Olubunmi, \u201cIf you have been following the communiqu\u00e9 of individual members, you would notice that gradually over the last couple of months, most members have moved from maintaining to an increase. At the last meeting, it was just a narrow decision for them to maintain it.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising and if looked at in the context of what is happening globally, interest rates are rising and one of the major ways the CBN can actually make Nigeria look a bit more competitive is for them to raise rates.\n\n\u201cGlobally, inflation rate is also increasing and in Nigeria, while there are other factors that contribute to rising inflation, one of the ways of combating that is to also raise rates.\n\n\u201cAlso, with electioneering, there would be a significant increase in money in circulation and one of the ways to try reduce the effect of that transmitting to higher inflation is to actually raise rates.\u201d\n\nJames Emejo and Nume Ekeghe in Abuja",
