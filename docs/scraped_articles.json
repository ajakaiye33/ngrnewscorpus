          "text": "A consultant clinical oncologist and lecturer at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Dr. Omolola Salako, has advised cancer patients to seek specialists\u2019 attention for treatment of their ailment rather than embracing medications from quack doctors, spiritualists and non-specialists.\n\nAccording to her, cancer patients die due to wrong diagnosis and treatment methods, adding that treatment of cancer is \u2018super-specialised\u2019 and required the effort of experts to handle because cancer was not a death sentence.\n\nShe spoke during the 2nd Annual Memorial Cancer Awareness Lecture, organised by Ellen Adeyinka Anjorin Cancer Foundation with the theme, \u2018Cancer treatment with special reference to Chemotherapy: pros and cons\u2019, held in Lagos.\n\nSalako said, \u201cCancer is an uncontrollable and fast cell division and/or growth, a terminal disease in which abnormal cells grow in a particular part of the body with the potential of spreading and distorting the body\u2019s immune system and tissues without respect for age, gender or race.\n\n\u201cCancer in women occurs usually as breast or cervical cancer while in men, it\u2019s either prostate or kidney cancer. It is a public health crisis in Nigeria with about 120, 000 new cases per annum. The treatment of cancer is so delicate that is why the effort of specialists is key for patients\u2019 survival.\u201d\n\nThe oncologist who identified cancer care as a complex task, added that its treatments \u2018requires collaboration among health care professionals\u2019 with complementary clinical skills who work together to share latest evidence, expertise and exchange information.\n\nAlso speaking, the Founder, EAACF, Olusegun Anjorin, said, the foundation was named after his wife, Ellen Anjorin, who died from cancer of the colon, while undergoing chemotherapy, adding that \u2018the foundation was formed in her honour to serve as a living memorial\u2019.\n\nAccording to him, he discovered that financial implications, treatment pattern and education are paramount issues of concern in cancer management.\n\nA consultant clinical oncologist and lecturer at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Dr. Ismail Zubair, while delivering his lecture on \u2018Coping with the side effects of chemotherapy and outlook\u2019 said, \u201cChemotherapy is a treatment modality for cancer patients where a drug or a combination of drugs are administered to eradicate cancer cells from the body.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Domestication of UN CRPD Article 4 will end insecurity in Nigeria \u2014 JONAPWD",
          "text": "\n\nBy Abayomi Adeshida, Abuja\n\nThe American government has been urged to continue to provide all the support required to influence the domestication of the United Nations\u2019 CRPD Article 4 which is capable of bringing a permanent end to the current security challenges in the country, so that the support from the American government to Nigeria henceforth would be for visible developmental projects.\n\nThese were contained in a letter signed by the Secretary Board of Trustees, of The Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD) Ms. Omotunde Ellen Thompson to congratulate the Government and People of the United States of America on the occasion of the country\u2019s 250th Independence day celebrations.\n\nin the letter, the JONAPWD reasoned that, \u201d If the National Assembly, shall repeal section 12 and include the UN CRPD Article 4, into the Nigerian Constitution through its domestication during the ongoing attempt to review the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u2019s 1999 Constitutional by the Legislative Arm of government, we are very sure that the problems of insurgency, insecurity, terrorism, bandits, and kidnapping in Nigeria shall find permanent solutions through your continued direct helps.\n\n\u201cThis is very important to the American government and people because as soon as the war against the security challenges in Nigeria is won permanently, the American taxpayers funds would be channeled towards the consolidation of the Nigerian democratic process that would further contribute to the growth of democracy in Nigeria.\n\nIn the letter dated 4th July, 2021 and addressed to Her Excellency Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard at the United States Embassy, Plot 1075 Diplomatic Drive, Central District Area, Abuja, FCT Nigeria with a copy sent to Anne Patterson, Mission Director, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Plot 1075 Diplomatic Drive, Central District Area, Abuja, FCT Nigeria with the Subject, RE: Happy 250th Years Fourth of July Independence Day Anniversary, the JONAPWD clearly articulated the relationship between the American Government and Niegrians living with disability which has spanned over well two decades.\n\nAccording to the letter, JONAPWD stated that, \u201cWe wish to felicitate the United States of America and her Citizens, on this auspicious occasion of July 4th which commemorates the Two hundred and Fiftieth Years (250th) Fourth of July, Independence Day Anniversary.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Trustees of The Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD), especially, wishes the United States President Joe Biden, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the First Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and the American People a happy 250th year Independence Day Anniversary.\n\n\u201cIt is on record today that because of the direct actions taken by the American people and their Government, we the Nigerians with Disabilities are equally celebrating our independence, after more than one hundred years of being denied a Disability-Inclusive Constitution which had robbed us of our contribution to development, participation in democracy and governance as well as active involvement in the political and electoral processes at every election cycle in the country.\n\n\u201cWe wish to seize this medium to appreciate the contributions of Nigerian-Americans and the coalition of American-based Non-governmental agencies as properly coordinated by Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities International, Inc, (ERPWDI) as well as the personal efforts of their President, Chief Eric Ndubueze Ufom and Executive Secretary, Mrs. Ngozi Pauline Ikebuaku, who since more than 25 years, have been working directly in collaboration with us to advocate and negotiate for the protection and promotion of the Rights and human dignity of Nigerians with Disabilities.\n\n\u201cWe therefore thank the American Taxpayers, never getting tired of the period it took the well-coordinated efforts of the Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities International, Inc, (ERPWDI) led by Chief Ufom, Mrs. Ikebuaku and the cooperation of those in their network for directly, championing our more than 20 years of negotiations and advocacy for Disability Policy Changes in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey formed the arrowhead of a well organized body that held our hands to walk through the rough way to freedom by holding several high level meetings with the Nigerian National Assembly, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Permanent Mission of Nigeria to the United Nations, Ministry of Justice and Attorney Genial of Nigeria, The Presidency\u2019s Head of the Civil Service of the Federation of Nigeria, Office of the Secretary of the Government of Nigeria\n\n\u201cThese committed groups that organised under one umbrella took the challenge to make life meaningful for the People With Disability in Nigeria, as they commenced the attempt to domesticate the American Disability Act (ADA) under the administration of Former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cThe resilient group continued to push for the process even under the leadership of the Late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua as well as his successor, President Goodluck Jonathan,\u201d The JONAPWD submitted.\n\nThe Board of trustees continued by appreciating the fact that the efforts were crowned finally under the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, and listing the achievements to include, \u201d Our Federal Republic of Nigeria, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Permanent Mission of Nigeria to the United Nations, signed and ratified, the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol. We successfully advocated for its implementation by both our Nigerian Legislative and Executive Branches of Government.\n\n\u201d National Assembly, successfully, enacted, harmonized, voted and passed into law, Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act 2018, pursuant to Nigeria\u2019s obligation to impalement, the above UN Human Rights Treaty of the 21st Century, the Convention, \u201d as well as, \u201cHE President Muhammadu Buhari signed it into law, on 23rd January, 2019.\n\nContinuing, the BOT pointed out that, \u201d The Presidency\u2019s Head of the Civil Service of the Federation of Nigeria developed the Organogram and recommendation used by the Secretary of the Government of the Federation for the establishment of an independent, implementation National Commission for Persons with Disabilities.\n\n\u201cOn 24th August, 2020, HE President Muhammadu Buhari, established the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities. And on the same day, he announced the names of the Executive Secretary and Governing Council members, to represent each of the 6 geographical zones of Nigeria and Dr. Hussaini Suleiman Kangiwa, as Chairman.\n\n\u201cOn 3rd December, 2020, the Honorable Speaker of the House of Representatives, established, House Standing Committee on Disability. He appointed its Committee members.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State Disability Rights Law was signed on December 21, 2005 and eight years later, on April, 2013, in collaboration with Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities International, Inc (ERPWDI), we directly, successfully negotiated for its implementation commission to be established. We repeated the same good results in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe wish to show our appreciation for the multiple opportunities given to Miss Omotunde Ellen Thompson, the Secretary, JONAPWD Board of Trustee (BoT), who served at the Center for Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities (CAPWD), as one of their major Nigerian representatives, during all those high-level meetings.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, kindly note that since we formed the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities of Nigeria (JONAPWD-National), the United States Government, through the USAID-Nigeria, U.S. Mission to Nigeria, International Republic Institute, Pack-Nigeria and others, have always been our highest grants donors. You were the best in protecting and promoting our Constitutional, Social, disability and Human Rights.\n\n\u201cOn 27th May, 2021, to ensure that we successfully, implement the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2018 and its National Commission for Persons with Disabilities, the United States Government, led by Her Excellency Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard, held a diplomatic meeting with the National Commission for Persons with Disabilities, led by the Chairman, Dr. Hussaini Suleiman Kangiwa; its South-Eastern Zone Governing Council member, Hon. Onyejelam Jaja Oparaku, the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities of Nigeria (JONAPWD-National) and Center for Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities (CAPWD), led by Miss Omotunde Ellen Thompson and Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities Initiative (ERPWDI) (aka Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities International, Inc (ERPWDI), led by Mrs. Ngozi Pauline Ikebuaku.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was to discuss, needed urgent commitment by our Federal Republic of Nigeria, to the implementation of the Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2018 and Its National Commission for Persons with Disabilities, as mandated by the United Nations Convention on the rights of Persons with Disabilities, especially, its article 4 (4.3).\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are thirty-one (31) million Nigerians with Disabilities, Almajiris, IDP, Nigerian wounded Military men and Women, who would be direct beneficiaries of a proper implementation of the disability law that was originally designed to protect them, but were denied constitutional, civil, human and disability rights to enjoy equal independence like the Americans with other Nigerians, due to section 12 of the 1999 Federal Republic of Nigeria Constitution.\n\n\u201cThey shall have the full independence to enjoy real Disability-Inclusive and accessible Developments which would enhance their contribution to nation-building in their chosen field of human endeavour, if section 12 is successfully repealed by the National Assembly during the ongoing 1999 constitutional review.\n\n\u201cThey shall also fully start participating in Democracy and Governance to the best of their aspiration; have the opportunity to make Political contribution and exercise their rights during the electoral process even as they would be factored into the plans of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 2030 Agenda just like Americans with Disabilities.\n\n\u201cOnce again, we wish the American people and government through the staff of the American Mission in Nigeria, a Happy 250th Year Independence Day Anniversary\u201d, the JONAPWD Board of Trustees Secretary wrote.",

          "text": "\n\nBy Abayomi Adeshida, Abuja\n\nFollowing the recent suspension of the over two months strike action by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) recently, a Wuse Zone 2 Magistrates\u2019 Court, Abuja, has fixed July 23 for the arraignment of two staff members of the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA) for alleged forgery and falsification of documents.\n\nIn a notice served on all the parties involved, Magistrate Mabel Segun-Bello, fixed the date following the suspension of the 64-day industrial action embarked upon by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN).\n\nAlthough the arraignment was stalled on April 26th this year because of the strike action by the staff of the curts, the new date had been communicated to parties in the suit through hearing notices served on them by the court bailiff.\n\nIn a separate letter,the court had, on March 18th, 2021 given the Commissioner of Police, FCT Command, three weeks to produce the Head of Legal Services and Secretary to OGFZA, Mr. Wasiu Sule as well as the Head of Human Resources OGFZA, Mr. Alenju Ngofa the two staff who allegedly conived to tamper with some documents for arraignment.\n\nThe court chose to give the order in a letter titled, \u201cReference of Direct Criminal Complaint by 1. Mr. Olufunmilayo David Omosule 2. Mr Mukhtar B. Usman AND 1. Mr. Wasiu Sule and 2. Slenju Angofa,\u201d after counsel to the nominal complainant, Nkereuwem Akpan, informed the court that both officials of the OGFZA, who are the accused persons, had evaded service of court processes despite several attempts.\n\nThe magistrate went further to give the police commissioner the order to investigate the defendants on allegations levelled against the 1st and 2nd defendants, Sule and Ngofa respectively by the complainant Mr Olufunmilayo David Omosule.\n\n.\n\nIt can be recalled that the management of OGFZA and Omosule had been locked in a legal battle as Omosule elected to challenge the legality of his 2011 suspension before the courts.\n\nOmosule claimed that he was eased out of office after he raised a petition against some management staff of the agency on alleged corruption.\n\nIn his prayers before the courts against the management staff of the agency, he had claimed that the defendants wilfully and maliciously distorted his records \u201cto appear as though he does not possess any requisite qualification to be employed at OGFZA or any qualification at all to be considered for promotion.\u201d\n\nOmosule went further to insist that their action was tantamount to forgery and falsification of documents contrary to Section 363 and 364 of the Penal Code, which is detrimental and injurious to his person and punishable under the laws of Nigeria.\n\nOmosule said he was laid off his duty post as the manager of its Abuja office of OGFZA via a letter dated April 18, 2011, on the grounds that he refused to comply with an earlier letter dated Dec. 3, 2010, which had directed him to present the originals of his credentials for verification.\n\nIn his response contained in the suit before the courts, he however, refuted the claim of the authority, stating that he made available to the organisation, Certified True Copies (CTCs) of his educational certificates /credentials, including GCE \u2018O Level certificates and degree certificates as instructed.\n\nHe proceeded further to claim that the originals of his credentials were misplaced in untraceable circumstances as at December 2010 when he was requested to present the originals of his credentials; and that the CTCs of his certificates submitted to the agency were certified by the issuing institutions, which included West African Examination Council and the University of Ado-Ekiti, then Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti respectively.\n\nIn his prayers before the courts, Omosule had sought the pronouncement by the court that he was still a staff of the organisation and entitled to all the rights, privileges and benefits due to him by reason of his employment.\n\nHe also prayed the court to make an order directing the defendants to reinstate him to the position of a director, on grade level 17, a position he claimed his contemporaries were currently in.\n\nWith the same breath, he has sought for the order of the court to direct OGFZA to pay all his outstanding salaries, benefits\n\nand entitlements since the year 2011 when he was suspended from the office.\n\nOmosule has also asked the court to award exemplary and general damages up to the sum of N50 million to him.\n\nThe notice of hearing of the case that was slated for Court 2 of the FCT High Court at Wuse Zone 2, Abuja was dated the 24th of June 2021, under the stamp and signature of the Registrar of the court",

Maryam Ahmad further decried the high rate of out of school children in the country which stands at 13.5 million.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThere are over 13.5 million children in Nigeria who are unable to access free and quality basic education, with the girl child in North Eastern states having a higher percentage of this figure. Crisis, insecurity, cultural and religious dispositions and poor funding have been limiting factors to quality education in these states.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the novel COVID-19 pandemic has further put a strain on child education. It is a known fact that schools in Nigeria remained closed throughout the COVID-19 lockdown. This situation has increased the number of children especially girls who are unable to access free, compulsory, quality and basic education.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, LEDAP in conjunction with Malala Fund is raising awareness on the right to free, compulsory and quality basic education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe project is aimed at providing solution to the low education enrollment and high rate of school drop out for children in Nigeria, and in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic; to mitigate its impact on the education of children in the state by ensuring that the Kano state government takes appropriate action to promote free and quality basic education for all, especially girls.\u201d\n\nShe further called on the ministries of Education and Justice of each state to prioritize right to education of the child in their agenda and to guarantee that no child in the state is denied access to free, basic and quality education.\n\n\u201cThe Government must bring back better by introducing gender responsive measures that will transform education system and address the barriers inhibiting girl child education in the state.\n\n\u201cLEDAP urges the government to commit resources to education through increased budget allocation and funding so as to ensure that no child is denied access to free basic education by any school and to drastically reduce the number of out of school children in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nIf this is done, there would be improved learning infrastructure, deployment and provision of incentives for qualified teachers and a massive enrolment of school children especially girls,\u201d Okoroigwe however stated.",

As soon as the dog, Mario, was brought out, the women grabbed the pup, fled the store, and sped off in a silver Chevy HHR car with no license plates.\n\nThe women were shortly arrested after they stopped over to put back their license plates.

          "title": "How I met and married TB Joshua, by wife, Evelyn",
          "text": "By Chika Abanobi\n\nOn Monday, July 5, 2021, she led the candlelight procession to begin the one-week programme leading to the burial of her late husband, Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, Founder and General Overseer of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Lagos. He died suddenly in the early hours of Sunday, June 5, 2021 from a yet-to-be-publicly-disclosed ailment.\n\nOther events include tribute service held on Tuesday, July 6, and Wednesday, July 7, in which dignitaries, acquaintances, associates, ministers of God from across the globe, members of his congregation, beneficiaries of his philanthropy and the public gave moving testimonies concerning the noble life that he lived. In 2011, the man was estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth US$10-15 million. The tribute service was followed by service of songs/all-night praise, and lying-in-state, on Thursday, July, 8. The ceremony will be rounded off tomorrow with a thanksgiving service\n\nBut throughout the pre-burial programmes, Evelyn, TB Joshua\u2019s wife of 31-years marriage, exhibited extraordinary stoicism as she took everything in her strides. But as dignitaries gathered, on the day of service of tributes to pay compliments to her husband on the life of worthy legacy that the Nigerian charismatic pastor, prophet, philanthropist, and televangelist who mesmerized his world with prophecies and miracles of healing and deliverance, lived, she could not help but betray emotion as she talked about their marriage. Suddenly, her seemingly stoic mien gave way to a tear-choked voice halfway through her short testimony.\n\nMe, other women and TB\n\nIt brought back memories of the story that she told this reporter and Shola Oshunkeye, then editor of the defunct The Spectator, our sister newspaper at the time, of how she met and married her world-renowned sweetheart. Her husband is a man that every woman would want to have as husband she said, at the start of the interview.\n\nAsked if her statement presupposed that she was in a serious contest or battle with other women over him, she retorted, amid laughter: \u201cNot at all. I know that every woman will desire to have him as a husband but there are no struggles on my part to keep him. I know that when a man is hardworking and God-fearing, every woman will like to have him. But believe me, I fight no special battles to keep him.\u201d\n\nWhen the interviewers wondered how she was able to cope with his busy schedule, knowing fully well that women need their husbands, she answered that she didn\u2019t have any difficulties handling that aspect of their relationship because \u201cGod has so made it that we complement each other perfectly well in very many ways.\u201d With this answer, she launched into the story of how they met and married. The marriage is blessed with three children. Her story:\n\nMy first visit to TB\u2019s house\n\n\u201cIt was around 1989. I visited a sister somewhere at Ikotun Egbe Lagos, where the headquarters of the Synagogue Church of All Nations is located at present. And, they were talking about a particular man, a prophet to be precise. It was a kind of a meeting. And, it\u2019s like everybody in that gathering, or at least half of the people in the room, had actually visited him. So, they were saying a lot of good things about him. This one said he prayed for him and things became okay from there. Another said her life was a bend but straightened up when she met him. You know, things like that. I was thrilled. At the end of the whole thing, I called the sister outside and asked whether she could take me to the prophet. I didn\u2019t ask to go there out of curiosity. I actually needed a guide at that point in time.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t at any crossroads, but I desperately needed a guide. I had seen pastors. I worshipped in a church and I had read about prophets in the Bible, though I had not come across any. But at that particular time, I needed a guide, sort of and he fitted the bill snugly. Then I used to worship with the Assemblies of God Church. But back to my story, the sister and I scheduled a date. We got to his place but he was not around. Not to the Synagogue, but his house down in Ikotun Egbe, at Agodo. Unfortunately, we did not meet him at home. But looking back now, I thank God that we didn\u2019t meet him that day because that would have been the end of the story. It would have been because of what he told me the very first day that I set eyes on him. If the sister were there, I would have believed that maybe she had gone behind me to tell him all about me. And, that would have ruined it.\n\nSecond visit and TB\u2019s strange, shocking proposal\n\n\u201cSome months later, I eventually met him when I visited him. That was in 1990. I could remember that day was a public holiday. I remember also that I nearly lost my way because I had never been to the place before except that day I went with the sister. But this time around I went alone. But before I was able to locate the place, it was a bit difficult. When I got into the waiting room, I met two men waiting to see him. Before this time, the idea that I had about the Prophet was that of an old man with white, long beards, and things like that. So, on that day, I was reading a novel that I came with, I don\u2019t remember the title now, when I suddenly saw someone come into the sitting room, pick one or two things and went back. But the shadow of whatever I saw was not that of an old man.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t greet him. I didn\u2019t even look at his face. But when he left, I overheard one of the two men telling the other one, \u2018that\u2019s him; that\u2019s him.\u2019 I looked up but he was gone. They went into the consulting room before I did. Finally, it came to my turn, and I went in there. We sat opposite each other. And, he was gazing at me. He did that for about a minute and some seconds. I gazed at him, too. Transfixed as I was, I noticed that there was a piece of paper before him. Still looking at me, he wrote on it a Yoruba word \u201cEjide\u201d (translated, it means twin has come). Lest I forget, I\u2019m a twin.\n\n\u201cFor about a minute or so, we sat looking at each other until he wrote my name on that piece of paper. And, then we started talking. He told me a lot of things about myself, the ones I know and the ones I didn\u2019t know. I was shocked. He told me about my family, about my past, my present, and my future. After your secondary school education at that time, you could get a job in a factory or whatever, hoping to be staffed one day. So, after my secondary school education, life was like, today you are in business, tomorrow, you are in a printing press, and so on. I think the last place I worked before I met him was at Nigerian Distilleries in Ota, Ogun State. I was born into a family of seven. We are the fifth in the family, my twin brother and I. But he is late. I was born to the late Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Akabude in the quiet town of Okala Okpuno in Oshimili North Local Government of Delta State.\n\n\u201cI started my primary education at St. Emecheta Primary School, Ezi Town, also in Delta State. Years later, I came to Lagos. That was in 1977 and completed my primary education at Orile Primary School, Oshodi, and, my secondary school at Grammar School, Oshodi. He told me all that. Altogether, we spent about 45 minutes. At the end of the whole thing, he spoke to me in Yoruba and said: \u201cJoo ma binu o. Ma ro pe bi mo se nba gbogbo eniyan ti o ba wa s\u2019odo mi soro ni eleyi o. Mi o ni ale, mi o dee fee ni ale. Sugbon, se oo fe mi? (Please, don\u2019t be annoyed. Don\u2019t think that this is how I talk to everyone that comes to me. I don\u2019t have a concubine, and I don\u2019t want to have a concubine. But can you marry me?).\n\n\u201cIt was strange, but that gives us an insight into what the Scripture says that the Spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God\u2019s children, as written in Romans 8:16. When I woke up that morning, I never knew. But something in me said: \u2018Go to the Prophet.\u2019 And, when he proposed to me, it was strange. I don\u2019t think I have said yes up till now (laughter) but then, my heart agreed with it instantly. I think that was it. That was how I met him.\n\nHis qualities that won my heart\n\n\u201cSome months later, I asked him why he thought it was right seeing a lady for the first time and going on to propose to her. He said he has seen me four days before that very day. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t know whether it was through dream or revelation. But at that time a lot of things were going on in my mind concerning him. In the first place, I was expecting to see an elderly man. But I was shocked to see a dashing handsome young man. Like I told you, he wrote my name on the piece of paper before him. That was the first thing that really shocked me. And, the fact that he proposed to me the first time that we met without waiting to know some things about me.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, like him then, I didn\u2019t have friends. As I told you, it was a sister that I visited who took me there in the first place. So, there is no how anybody could have gone to tell him about me. And, when I was going there the second time, she wasn\u2019t there. I went alone. I have told you how I got to know about him. I told you, too, that I didn\u2019t go there out of curiosity. I needed some guidance which I believe I could get from the prophet. That\u2019s why I went.\n\n\u201cYou know, life is all about challenges. As a young lady, I knew that God was there. I have a Creator and I know He can guide me into the right path. So, I wouldn\u2019t say business or marriage or whatever drove me to him. I just needed someone to guide me on the right path. I saw an honest and humble man.\n\nI saw a God-fearing man, too.

          "title": "Deadly trap: How evangelist, others slaughtered building contractor",
          "text": "By Chioma Okezie-Okeh\n\nSometime in April 2020, a building contractor known as Engineer Godwin Christopher received a call from a supposed priest requesting the contractor\u2019s services to construct a big church auditorium in Lafia Nassarawa State.\n\nOn April 16, Engineer Godwin, in company of the supposed priest who was taking him for site inspection, walked into the trap of hired assassins. They descended on the contractor and promptly slaughtered him.\n\nThe suspected assassins who were later arrested by operatives of Force Special Tactical Squad (STS) claimed that they were contracted to kill him and retrieve his SIM card by his friend identified as Sylvester Agwale, a Christian missionary.\n\nSaturday Sun learnt from police sources that the deceased\u2019s family alerted the operatives when they realised that their brother, who told them of the site inspection with the priest, was suddenly incommunicado.\n\nThey were able to track down the supposed priest, Samuel Aloko who turned out to be one of the assassins. He led the police to arrest Micah Adeka and Sylvester Agwale. The two later confessed to the police that they participated in the act while two others remain at large.\n\nEngineer was stingy\n\nOn why he ordered the execution of the deceased, SylvesterAgwale, the mastermind told Saturday Sun that all he was focused on was how to get his hands on the millions in the account of the late engineer whom he referred to as a friend.\n\n\u201cI am 29 years old and a native of Lafia in Nassarawa State. I am a member of Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) in Nassarawa and one of the dedicated persons in the missionary department. It was during one of our work that I met Engineer Godwin.\n\n\u201cHe is a contractor and has many sites where he is building houses. I started working as his assistant and we became so close that he can send me to buy building materials worth millions of naira without fear that I could run away with the money.\n\n\u201cThe only problem was that he is not generous to me. I was preparing for my wedding and he knew about it. I begged him for sponsorship, instead of giving me good money he only gave me N50, 000 donation. He then gave me a loan of N450, 000.\n\n\u201cI was not happy and decided to call my friends to get money from him. I observed that there was always so much money in his car. I had seen him bring as much as N1million from the car.\n\n\u201cI called my people and we met at a hotel in Nassarawa where we agreed that they should rob him and collect the SIM card. I told them that if the man dared to resist them, they should kill him. To further convince them, I called the engineer and asked him to send money to my account and he sent N30, 000. I told them that I overheard him talking about N25 million that was recently paid into his account for one of the jobs that he was doing.\n\n\u201cWe agreed that Samuel would be the one to woo him. He pretended that he was a pastor and wanted to build a church. In fact, on the day of the meeting, Samuel called him and gave him an appointment to come and see the site so that they could agree on an estimate. I also gave four of the boys who were at the meeting N50, 000 each as advance fees. I got the money from the allowance that the church paid me for my missionary work. I had hoped that since we were expecting millions, that all would be well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to create an alibi for himself, Agwale went to the site where the deceased was supervising his project and offered to assist him as usual. \u201cI was there when he left. He told me that he wanted to check up on a project. I knew that it was Samuel that called him. I waited behind and alerted them that he was on the move.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour later, they called me that the man was dead and that nothing was found in his car. I still don\u2019t believe that story; I am sure they collected the money and hid it from me. Samuel brought the SIM card to me and I took it to meet my friend who is an expert.\n\n\u201cWe generated a new password but unfortunately before we could withdraw money from the account, it had been blocked. It was then that I knew that there was trouble. I warned everyone to go underground, but unfortunately, they were careless and Micah was arrested. He was the one who led the police to pick me.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry for allowing greed to lead me to this kind of horrible sin. I only ask God to have mercy on my soul because I know that I will be killed.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Micah claimed that when he and others were contacted, the message was to kill the engineer. \u201cWe knew from the beginning that the engineer must die. \u201cSometime in April, Samuel called me and two others that there was a job for us and N25 million was involved. It was my friend Agwale that brought the job. If the job was successful, we would all get at least N5million each. I requested that we should meet with Agwale to be sure that it was not a trap. We met at a hotel where he confirmed the job. He told us to kill the man and collect the SIM card.\n\n\u201cHe told us that someone is on standby to withdraw the money and offered the four of us N50, 000 advance payments. On April 16, which was the date of the incident, Samuel dressed up like a priest and went to an agreed spot to pick the engineer. He had told the man that they were going to inspect a land that will be used to build a big church. We took him to a site called Project in Lafia. It is a new site where people are buying land so much. As soon as he got to the agreed point, we attacked him. One of us gave him a cut on the neck while I stabbed him severally on the stomach till he died.\n\nSamuel took his phone and we searched his car. Unfortunately, only N50 was found. I don\u2019t know if Samuel took the money while we were busy killing the man.\n\n\u201cAs we were going, we broke the glass of the car so that people would think that he was robbed and killed by robbers. We were waiting for Agwale to keep to his own side of the deal when I got information that Samuel had been arrested by the police. I ran to Latan area and stayed there. I was called to supply bags of beans to a buyer and when I went there I discovered that the buyers were policemen from STS.\u201d\n\nOn how he became a cold-hearted criminal, Micah said he was lured into crime by friends. \u201cI am 26 and I\u2019m married with two kids. After my secondary education, I joined my parents and became a rice, yam and beans farmer. I did well and was able to raise money that I used to get married at the age of 22.\n\nUnfortunately, along the line, I made friends with some young herders in our area. They have big guns and they taught me how to make fast money through kidnapping and cattle rustling. I made a lot of money and it was during some of our operations that I met Samuel and Agwale. Agwale is aware that we are criminals and he has brought several jobs for us and he was given his share from the proceeds,\u201d he alleged. While insisting that he did not find any money in the car of the deceased, Samuel said that he played his role as a priest and convinced the deceased to follow him. \u201cI called him as agreed and quoted parts of the Bible to him to convince him that I am a priest. \u201cHe was so happy when we met and I was carrying a big Bible. I told him that the church is planning to spend at least N100 million on the project and he was explaining how he would get it done at a much cheaper rate.\n\n\u201cI even prayed for him in the car while we were driving to the agreed spot. As soon as he stepped down from the car and I was pointing at the land, the others attacked.\n\n\u201cI am sorry that I allowed the devil to use me to deceive him in the name of God. I am not a pastor and I rarely go to church. It was Agwale that told us that the man was a religious man and would easily be fooled if we used that strategy. I am sorry and I pray for mercy.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa and Vera Wisdom-Bassey\n\nThe remains of the late Prophet TB Joshua, Founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), were laid to rest yesterday at his church in Ikotun-Egbe area of Lagos. He died in Lagos on June 5. It was an event that attracted several eminent personalities from Nigeria as well as other dignitaries from across the globe. People in their numbers started trooping into the church from early in the morning. Security personnel, church\u2019s guards and ushers had a hectic time controlling the crowd. At exactly 10am, the casket bearing the corpse was rolled into the church\u2019s large auditorium by the undertakers. There were cries of agony in and outside the auditorium.\n\nThe bereaved wife, Evelyn, their three daughters and other members of the family ushered in the corpse to the middle of the church. Ondo State Government House Choir gave a soul-lifting rendition. Tee Mac Omatshola, the flutist, also rendered a song to wish the man of God goodbye. International gospel singer, Byron Cage, also performed.\n\nI benefited financially from him \u2013 Gov Akeredolu\n\nExtolling his virtue, Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), said Nigeria has lost a rare gem and special breed. He said the prophet contributed greatly to the emancipation of the less-privileged in Ondo, Nigeria and beyond.\n\nHe said TB Joshua was a special creature right from childhood, and started performing miracles even as a young man while in school.\n\nThe governor said that the man of God led a fulfilled life that impacted all, irrespective of race or tribal and religious affiliations. \u201cThe world is more represented here than when Nelson Mandela was buried. This shows that he was a global citizen.\n\n\u201cHis love was not only for the less-privileged but he also did good for the privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen I was just elected as a governor, he came to my house and gave me good money. He also gave me more money to be delivered to my wife, which I delivered to her. \u201cHe also paid electricity bills for four local government areas in Ondo State. He bought transformers for many communities in our state. Many of us sought deliverance from him and we got our deliverance. \u201cSynagogue Church is one of the most important tourist centres in Nigeria. Everyone benefits from the church in one way or the other. \u201cHis legacy is worthy of emulation. He has engraved his legacy in the hearts of people all over the world. Indeed, the world is mourning. We can never forget his humanitarian gestures.\n\n\u201cBy all standard, TB Joshua led a Christ-like life. Let us all imbibe his exemplary life. He preached love and was a man of peace. \u201cHe was focused despite his criticisms and misgivings by some people. Who are you to decide who to follow Jesus?\u201d\n\nHe was a General, God\u2019s servant -Sanwo-Olu\n\nAlso paying tribute to the man of God, Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, described the prophet as a General in God\u2019s House. He said that TB Joshua\u2019s life was worthy of emulation. He added that the cleric\u2019s story was an inspirational one that cannot be forgotten in a hurry. He said that the prophet never forgot his roots, even after he became a renowned leader and global evangelist.\n\nSanwo-Olu, whose speech was delivered by the state commissioner for Home Affairs and Culture, Prince Olanrewaju Elegushi, said TB Joshua played the role of a father to many orphans and led a life of dedication, love and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cHe helped many people to fulfill destinies that God has given them. His life should encourage us to renew our hope in Christ. Prophet TB Joshua\u2019s charitable gifts and love for humanity should open our eyes to the possibility of a world where we all live in peace despite our racial, religious and cultural differences,\u201d the governor said.\n\nYouths, street urchins besiege church entrance\n\nAt the entrance of the church, it was a herculean task for the security operatives as they battled to prevent many youths from forcefully gaining entrance into the premises. The youths, many of them street urchins, sang different songs, reflecting how the late prophet loved them and never despised them.\n\nDisplaying the deceased portrait, the angry youths claimed that they were bonafide members of Ikotun-Egbe community that must not be edged out in the scheme of things. The security personnel, at some point, had to apply some force to keep the angry youths from pulling down the iron barricade that served as checkpoint for those allowed to cover the event.\n\n\u201cWe are here to wish him goodbye but we are treated like criminals by these security people. The man was not like this,\u201d one of the protesting youths said.\n\nBusiness booms\n\nMany people were seen making brisk business outside the premises of the Synagogue. While many of his followers were mourning the demise of their prophet, others were smiling to the bank, having tapped into the crowd that besieged the church to pay the deceased his last respects. The stretch of the median of Ikotun Egbe Street, where the church is located, was decorated with assorted materials engraved with the prophet\u2019s picture. There were, calendars, hats of different sizes, identity cards, T-shirts, wrist bands, fez caps, and key holders in large quantities. Joining others to extol the legacy of the SCOAN founder, the wife of the Ooni of Ife, Olori Naomi Ogunwusi Adeyeye, said Prophet TB Joshua was a gift to humanity who sacrificed all he had for others to be happy.\n\nShe described the late prophet as a true son of the soil who blessed so many people. She prayed for the wife, children, other relatives, and the church. Other dignitaries at the event include the deputy governor of Ondo State, Lucky Orimisan, Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly, Bamidele Oleyelogun, Lagos State Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Stephen Adegbite, representative of CAN\u2019s President, David Lyon, who was former governor-elect in Bayelsa State, Chairman of Egbe-Idimu Local Council Development Area, Kunle Sanyaolu and other persons and groups from different continents.\n\nAt 2.24pm, the body was taken from the church auditorium to his the tomb that was prepared for it, also within the church\u2019s premises. At that moment, the quite sobs metamorphosed into uncontrollable wailing. As the weeping pervaded the air, the casket was lowered to the ground at about 2.53pm. Bishop Steven Ogedengbe, Roberto Acosta from Argentina and other men of God within and outside Nigeria charged the congregation on the need to continue to celebrate TB Joshua, saying that the late prophet had fulfilled his own assignment on earth.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle hails from the Local government.\n\nThe affected communities are Tsauni, Gudan-Baushi, Gidan-Adamu, Wari and Gudan-Maidawa.\n\nAn indigene of the area, Malam Buba Faru, said the bandits, who rode over 100 motorcycles, stormed the communities located few kilometres on the eastern part of Faru town.\n\nBuba said the bandits shot indiscriminately at the people and burnt their houses and food stores.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting sporadically at people they came across in the five communities. They also attacked farmers who were in their farmlands cultivating their crops. So far, 42 dead bodies have been recovered by the security and volunteer groups in the area.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of the village, Ahmed Lawali, also confirmed the deadly invasion to THISDAY yesterday in a telephone interview, and said the bandits, numbering up to 70, stormed the village at about 4.30pm when most of the victims were working on their farmers.\n\nHe explained that the marauding bandits who were on reprisal mission to the village, trailed the farmers to their respective farms and started shooting sporadically, \u201cin the process, 39 persons mainly men, were massacred on the spot.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bandits raided the village following the arrest and killing of two of their members along Mafara- Faru road by the group of vigilantes popularly known as Yan\u2019sakai who nabbed them with two AK-47 riffles last Wednesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday (Thursday) at about 4:30pm bandits armed with sophisticated weapons attacked Faru Village when some of us were still working on our farms. They (bandits) killed 39 people on their farms and injured many others.\n\n\u201cThey (bandits) attacked the village because last Wednesday, Yan\u2019sakai arrested and killed two bandits along Mafara- Faru road who were nabbed with two AK-47 riffles. It was a reprisal mission.\n\n\u201dWe buried all the dead bodies this morning (Friday) according to Islamic rights after Friday prayer. We are calling on security agencies to come to our rescue so that we can return to our farms because farming is our main occupation here (in Faru).\u201d\n\nHowever, the Zamfara State Police Public Relations Officer SP. Muhammad Shehu, while confirming the incident, said 35 people lost their lives as a result of the attack by the bandits in the village.\n\nHe added that, a joint security task force comprising military, police, NSCDC had been deployed to the area \u201cand normalcy has been restored right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, their corpses were taken to Faru town where they were buried.\n\nShehu stated that the police could not reach the affected communities on time when they were informed of the bandits\u2019 attack due to the road network.\n\n\u201cThe police personnel tried their best to reach the affected communities on receiving the information that the bandits were there but unfortunately they could not reach the places because of the bad roads,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the \u201cpolice are currently working tirelessly\u201d to arrest the bandits\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi and Deji Elumoye\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday said the President Muhammadu Buhari administration plans to rely on a common-sense strategy to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a time frame of 10 years.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural meeting of the National Steering Committee on Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Prof. Osinbajo said the government would adopt a different and more effective approach in actualising the objective of eradicating poverty in the country for the sake of delivering results.\n\nA statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Office of the Vice President, Mr. Laolu Akande, quoted Prof Osinbajo as saying, \u201cI want us to approach this as much as possible, common-sensical so that we can resolve all the issues and focus on the real progress.\n\n\u201cI want us to look beyond all of what we are going to be doing, there is going to be a considerable amount of paperwork, but a lot of common sense is what grows economies. It\u2019s what other countries have done, not reinventing the wheel. So, I want us to focus on those common-sensical things so that we can move forward.\u201d\n\nExpressing the hope that this way, the Committee will be able to achieve rapid progress, Prof. Osinbajo said, \u201cin order not to make this merely, another of those high-sounding committees that eventually achieve nothing, we have to be very intentional about our objectives and how to achieve them.\u201d\n\nCiting the example of Bangladesh where a poverty reduction strategy was also implemented, the Vice-President noted how the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was key.\n\n\u201cBangladesh exports more garments than we export oil,\u201d the VP said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccountries that have managed to get out of poverty have created a lot of jobs through industries, and they have developed intentional strategies.\n\n\u201cWe must look at what others have done, the smart things that other people have done, and adopt. We have to think smartly about how we are funding agriculture,\n\n\u201cI think we really need to take a deep dive because governments have made several efforts at poverty alleviation but generally speaking, they have not yielded the sort of results they should yield, and I think it\u2019s because there is a lot of focus on documentation and paperwork and very little common-sense approaches,\u201d the VP added.\n\nOsinbajo explained that the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy is meant to be a national strategy, not just a federal effort and it is aimed at taking 100 million people, nationally, out of poverty within a target time-frame of 10 years.\n\nHe said, \u201cI just want to emphasise that it is a national strategy as opposed to a federal strategy which is why the steering committee is made up of federal, as well as state officials.\u201d\n\nWhile also emphasising the role of the private sector, the VP said, \u201cEssentially, this effort must also be directed at how to facilitate private sector creation of jobs. The fact is that there is no way that the federal government or the state governments can create the number of jobs that we need.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a few broad looks at the features of what constitutes our present predicaments in terms of job losses and unemployment.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said efforts will be made to focus attention on creating opportunities for Nigerians to earn decent livelihoods in addition to equipping them with the necessary vocational skills.\n\nAlso in attendance at the meeting were Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, who is also Nigeria Governors Forum Chairman, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, and Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State.\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha; Ministers of Agriculture, Muhammad Nanono; Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, and Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige also attended, while the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba joined the meeting virtually.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Oba of Benin, Obaseki Set for Showdown over Looted Artefacts",
          "text": "*FG demands unconditional repatriation from Germany\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nExcept a compromise is reached, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, are heading for a showdown over the impending return by Germany and the United Kingdom of artefacts stolen from the Benin Palace in 1897 during a raid by the colonial invaders.\n\nWhile the monarch favours the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or in the alternative, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the palace believes the governor prefers a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nHowever, Obaseki told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\n\nHe said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nNotwithstanding, the brewing quarrel in Benin may become public knowledge today as Oba Ewuare II addresses a historic press conference, the first ever, signposting the importance he attaches to the issue.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the brewing crisis may replay the bitter aspect of the history of ancient Benin Kingdom dating back to 1897 when Britain invaded the kingdom, subdued Oba Ovonramwen, plundered and looted his palace and sent him on exile.\n\nA Benin chief named Obaseki, said to be the great-grandfather of the current governor, was apprehended by palace historians as one of those who betrayed Oba Ovonramwen and made the British expedition a success.\n\n\u201cThe current standoff, therefore, has a touch of history,\u201d a Benin chief told THISDAY last night, pointing out: \u201cIt is significant that another Obaseki is at play on this occasion.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the imminence of the return of the looted artefacts by the UK, German and French governments, Obaseki came up with a grand plan to form a private trust, not owned by the state government, to take custody of the returning artefacts.\n\nHis plan, it is gathered, is to have the private trust build a museum of West African Arts in Benin, the state capital, where the artefacts would be kept and curated.\n\nLegacy Restoration Trust, a private entity, THISDAY learnt, has since emerged, parading itself as the authorised custodian of the artefacts.\n\nOba Ewuare II is said to have opposed this move on the ground that it would amount to private appropriation of the cultural heritage of his kingdom.\n\nWhile the monarch is said not to be opposed to the idea of the federal and state governments taking custody of the artefacts and keeping it in a museum to be built by them, he has expressed his objection to a private trust managing the ancient artworks.\n\n\u201cOba Ewuare\u2019s position,\u201d said a source, \u201cis that at the least the artefacts should return to the palace where they were stolen, contending that the palace could on its own build a museum where they would be kept and manage.\u201d\n\nThis position was well articulated in a statement by Benin Traditional Council dated 10th May 2021 and signed by the Secretary, Mr. Frank Irabor; and the Executive Assistant, Corporate and Legal Affairs, Mr. Denis Osaretin.\n\nDisowning Legacy Restoration Trust and Legacy and Legal Restoration Trust that it said had been parading themselves as presumptive custodians of the incoming artefacts, it said: \u201cFor categorical clarification, these individuals and groups of persons are not known nor authorised by the Oba of Benin, who is the original owner of the looted artefacts and the custodian of Benin customs and tradition.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpololokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, Oba of Benin remains the custodia Legis of all insignia, symbols and such other artefacts depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Benin people.\u201d\n\nIt said, the Oba of Benin or his duly authorised representative or body corporate, is, therefore, the only person that can have any dealings with any foreign donours or missions or any international institution over the artefacts.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that following this statement, the Secretary to the State Government had conversations with the palace secretary but the meeting ended in a deadlock with both parties hugging their mutually exclusive positions.\n\nAt the centre of the conflict, THISDAY has learnt, is the potentially huge financial resources that might accrue from the warehousing of the artefacts.\n\nAlready, the German government is committed to an initial donation of 4.5 million Euros to the Edo Museum of West African Arts and Cultural District projected to be built in Benin City.\n\nThis was revealed in a statement on Wednesday by Foreign Minister Maas, which spoke eloquently about the desire of Germany to return the artefacts in its custody and pay adequate reparation.\n\nObaseki too had spoken glowingly about his trust project last month after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, during which he sought the federal government\u2019s help to secure the return of the artworks.\n\nObaseki said museums had become catalysts in the evolution and development of cities.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThere is a city called Bilbao in Spain, and that was the head of the Basque separatist movements many years ago.\n\n\u201cThe investment by the Guggenheim Foundation, by the Guggenheim family museum in Bilbao, has changed the economic fortunes of that city.\n\n\u201cToday, Bilbao earns more than a billion dollars from just the presence of that museum in that city. Because everybody wants to come in to see what\u2019s in that museum.\n\n\u201cSo, bringing back these works, this world cherished works, bringing the originals back to their home, I mean, you can imagine for years to come, people, children unborn, all over the world want to come and see these pieces.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration was designing a whole cultural district for Benin, saying that the proposed museum would be situated within the cultural district.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs I speak, the planners from Latin America are in Benin City, looking at work and doing the surveys. That process should end in about August.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the museum is going to be a series of, you know, buildings, you have the pavilion where these works will be brought in initially and will be kept.\n\n\u201cWe also undertaking more archaeological excavations, and whatever we find will be kept in the pavilion.\n\n\u201cWe have a national museum that currently exists. And that\u2019s going to be refurbished, then we have the main Edo Museum of West African Arts. And the construction for that will take another one or two years to begin.\u201d\n\nOba Ewuare is, however, resisting the private trust, being promoted and led by Phillip Ihenacho, said to be Obaseki\u2019s business partner in Afrinvest, with Victor Ehikhamenor, Enotie Ogbebor, Eric Idiahi and Babatunde Adebiyi as trustees with renowned Ghanaian architect, David Adjaye as architectural consultant.\n\nTHISDAY learnt the monarch had reached out to the presidency and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, who appear to be sympathetic to the cause of having the looted artefacts returned to the palace from where they were stolen.\n\nFG Demands Unconditional Repatriation from Germany\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has urged Germany to ensure an unconditional return of the 1,130 Benin artefacts that were looted from Nigeria in the 19th century and domiciled in German museums.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, at meetings, held on Wednesday in Berlin with German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Monika Grutters, and Foreign Minister, Mr. Heiko Maas, said the return should be whole rather than substantial on the heel of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u201csubstantial return\u201d of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nHe added that the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the artworks.\n\n\u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin),\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, the minister reiterated that no conditions should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the artefacts, in addition to concluding all negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe said the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the artworks were not the end of an era but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy, between both countries.\n\nHe thanked Germany for taking the lead\n\nin the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts looted from Nigeria and the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead,\u201d he said Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum was being built-in Benin City to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nHe said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the federal government, the (Benin) royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nOn his part, the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar, said the issue of the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes should be seen as an opportunity to take the cooperation between Nigeria and Germany to a greater height.\n\nHe commended Germany for taking the lead in the repatriation process.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, had said: \u201cThe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the Nigerian delegation that the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from next year.\n\nShe stated that the fact that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, adding that all the museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani, and Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare, who was invited by the German government.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace-turned-museum in the heart of Berlin that houses art works from around the world.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Please reach out to whoever is appointed caretaker of the property. A concerned tenant who knows you as the owner of the property is trying to verify before she can pay the lady who is claiming ownership,\u201d the whistleblower said in a text.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, Ofili\u2019s lawyer, Barrister Geoffrey Ugwuayi, stated that the bubble burst when they wrote to the Senator\u2019s wife to renew her rent but was not forthcoming.\n\nHe sent a copy of the letter \u201cNotice for Rent Renewal\u201d given to the Senator\u2019s wife, dated March 2, 2021, and another one, March 22, 2021.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware that your rent for the four-bedroom duplex and three rooms en suite Boys Quarters situated in the above-mentioned address, which covers the period of February 25, 2020, to February 24, 2021, had expired on February 24, which was the date of the anniversary.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, wish to use this medium to notify you that we have our client\u2019s instruction to remind you to renew your rent of the sum of N3,500,000 per annum, which will cover the period of February 25, 2021, to February 24, 2022. Moreover, we wish to also bring to your notice that it is a settled law that in the absence of no contrary intention that rent is paid in advance,\u201d the letter partly reads.\n\nReplying through her lawyer, M.A Ajara, the Senator\u2019s wife, has April 30, 2021, for payment but still had not done so at the time of filing this report, thereby necessitating a court notice.\n\n\u201cOur client acknowledges the receipt of your letter dated March 2, 2021, on the above subject matter and apologizes for not responding immediately. This is because she has not been around, and the letter was received in her absence and forwarded to her.\n\n\u201cIn respect of the subject matter above, our client intends to renew her rent and appeal that your client gives her a little more time, within which to renew her rent. In this regard, she craves the indulgence of your client to further indulge her till the end of this month as she assures your client that the rent will be paid on or before April 30, 2021.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters learned that the tenants, Hajia Amina sublet the house to, are confused at the moment and are presently fighting hard to get back their rents, but they had not been able to reach the Senator\u2019s wife.",

          "title": "Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures",
          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, increased the popularity of mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The shortage in talent began compounding into increased workload and mounting pressure for remaining IT employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect the source\u2019s identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nSmile Identity\u2019s $7m Series A\n\nKenya increases the cost of airtime\n\nMarketForce\u2019s $2m pre-Series A\n\nNigeria\u2019s Federal Government to block MultiChoice accounts\n\nSmile Identity raises $7m Series A\n\nSmile Identity\n\nUS-based identity verification and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) compliance tools startup for Africans, Smile Identity, has announced a $7m Series A funding to build KYC and identity verification tools.\n\nThe round was led by Costanao Ventures and CRE Venture Capital. Existing investors like Khosla Impact, ValueStream Ventures, Beta.Ventures, 500 Startups, and Story Ventures participated. New VCs like LocalGlobe, Intercept Ventures, and Future Africa also took part in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, Smile Identity has raised $11 million from investors with this latest funding round. In 2019, it raised $4 million in seed funding.\n\nWhat does Smile Identity do? Founded by Mark Straub and Willliam Bares in 2017, Smile Identity provides identity verification and KYC compliance tools to help African banks, telecom companies, financial service providers, and ride-sharing businesses better engage their customers.\n\nExpansion so far? Following the co-founders\u2019 arrival in Africa, the business has made key strides in its activities, such as the establishment of a local presence in six African countries: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, the company claims to connect to over 15 different identity authorities, while its ID validation covers over 250 million identities on the continent.\n\nThe new investment will allow the company to offer even better services and grow in new markets. It will also support more ID types and hire more engineers and staff on the continent.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nSafaricom increases the cost of airtime\n\nKenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has accepted the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s additional taxes proposal.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recent call for new taxes on airtime and data service prices. Finally, the bill has been passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of recent changes to the taxation of telephone and Internet data services, Safaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s top telecom companies, has adjusted the pricing of its products and services.\n\nWhat does this mean for Safaricom\u2019s subscribers? Calls made between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. will now cost Sh4.87 per minute, while calls made between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. will only cost Sh2.50 per minute.\n\nThe cost of Safaricom home fibre for the lowest package will rise to Sh2,999 from Sh2,900, while the silver package increases to Sh4,100 from Sh3,999.\n\nThe gold and diamond packages \u2014 up from Sh5,699 and Sh11,499 \u2014 will now cost Sh6,299 and Sh12,499, respectively.\n\nAdditional fees were also introduced for roaming and international calls. The cost to send a single short message is now Sh1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of browsing via airtime (without bundles) will increase at a similar rate to voice calls.\n\nSimilar? Mobile network operators, including Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya, have also adjusted their calling charges. The two telecom companies have raised the rate of calls to Sh2.78 per minute. Also, the price of Telkom Kenya\u2019s SMS message has increased to Sh1.15.\n\nMarketForce raises $2 million pre-Series A round\n\nFeatured Image Credit: TechCrunch\n\nAnother funding? Yes. Kenyan B2B retail platform, MarketForce, has raised $2 million pre-Series A to focus on its business-to-business (B2B) retail marketplace, RajeRaje.\n\nWho participated in the round?

This round brings the funds raised by the company to $2.5 million.\n\nThe retail distribution platform got into Y Combinator accelerator\u2019s Summer batch 2020, and upon graduation, they decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRajeRaje is a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants and was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nWith RejaReja, it\u2019s interesting to see MarketForce joining other supply chain revamp startups like TradeDepot and Sokowatch to fix Africa\u2019s unorganised retail supply chains.\n\nRejaReja has more than 15,000 retail customers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania who use the platform to process thousands of orders daily.\n\nExpansion plans? It\u2019s planning on expanding to Nigeria with the new funds and expanding its product across East Africa.\n\nIncredibly, the founders \u2014 Tesh Mbaabu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Mesongo Sibuti, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) \u2014 are computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nNigeria to block MultiChoice Nigeria and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts\n\nDStv dish.

Yesterday, Thursday, July 8, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) announced that it had directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA) in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nWhy did it happen? Abdullahi Ahmad, the Director of Communications and Liaison Department, said the company has continuously violated all contracts and agreements with the tax agency.\n\nBesides, MultiChoice allegedly denied the FIRS access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMuhammed Nami, Executive Chairman, FIRS, said that the companies have failed to provide relevant and timely responses to correspondences, and their records are not accurate and accessible.\n\nSo, the banks that handle business for MultiChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria were instructed to perform a balanced search on their accounts before undertaking any other transaction on their behalf.\n\nNonetheless, MultiChoice believes that the case is based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d because they were not formally notified on the matter. Also, they said they had not given authorities full access to their subscribers\u2019 information.\n\nMultichoice told Reuters that they had previously engaged in an open, transparent, and constructive dialogue with FIRS, and they hoped that issue could be resolved amicably.\n\nSimilar? In 2018, MTN Nigeria Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes on imports and other payments from 2007 to 2017. However, the demand was later withdrawn.\n\nIf this controversy isn\u2019t resolved soon, it could have an adverse effect on DStv\u2019s operations in Nigeria.

They did not promptly respond to correspondences and lacked data integrity and transparency. It also added that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferring to the group\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary, the tax authority said MCN \u201chas avoided giving FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mohammed Nami, Executive Chairman FIRS, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nHowever, per TechCabal, MultiChoice\u2019s results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nAccording to Reuters, MultiChoice Group makes a third of its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. From the company\u2019s annual report, Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment.\n\nInterestingly, at the close of business yesterday, MultiChoice stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were down 7.38% from the previous day. The fall reached levels that have not been seen since October 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax to GDP ratio has steadily declined between 2001 to 2020, reaching a record low of 6.3% in July 2020\n\nWith such an abysmal tax to GDP ratio \u2014 one of the lowest in the world \u2014 the country has tried to increase its tax base. In 2017, it introduced the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), from which the government claimed to have raised \u20a670 billion\n\nIn 2019, it also increased its Value Added Tax from 5% to 7.5%, generating \u20a61.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiChoice becomes the second South African company to face a crackdown from Nigerian authorities. MTN has been the subject of several penalties, the most recent which occurred in 2018 involved a $2 billion tax bill for payments to foreign suppliers. The bill was later withdrawn.\n\nIn an official reply, MCN said it had not received any notification from FIRS yet. It has however indicated that it is willing to engage the tax authority transparently and constructively. It also said its operations in Nigeria are continuing.\n\nThe company says it has been and is currently discussing with FIRS regarding their concerns and believes they can resolve the matter amicably.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these words will ring true in the coming days.",

          "text": "The American University of Nigeria (AUN) on Saturday honoured the President of the African Development Bank, Akinwumi Adesina, with an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters.\n\nThe university bestowed the honour on Mr Adesina at its 12th joint commencement (graduation) ceremony for its classes of 2020 and 2021.\n\nAUN President (vice-chancellor), Margee Ensign, who garlanded Mr Adesina, said the AfDB President was honoured \u201cfor his exemplary service in the public sector.\u201d\n\nMs Ensign said Mr Adesina\u2019s record of service epitomises AUN\u2019s motto: Excellence, Integrity, Service \u2014 for the collective good of the people of Nigeria, of Africa and of the world.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, he stands for what AUN stands for as Africa\u2019s development university,\u201d Ms Ensign said. \u201cWe are honoured to honour a truly Nigerian and African hero.\u201d\n\nAn elated Mr Adesina described the award as an additional responsibility on him to do more for humanity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a call to do more, and I will,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be a great ambassador of this university.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB President later gave a commencement lecture entitled \u201cBuilding a New Nigeria: Imperative for Shared Prosperity\u201d at the ceremony.\n\nIn the keynote, Mr Adesina said he fully understood the challenges Nigeria is facing as a nation but expressed optimism that the country will arise from its problems, and become a more prosperous and united nation.\n\n\u201cI speak to you today as a Nigerian. As I have quite often said, I will live as a Nigerian, die as a Nigerian, and on the resurrection morning I will ask God for permission to rise as a Nigerian, with the green-white-green flag in my hand!\u201d Mr Adesina said.\n\n\u201cNigeria is blessed with incredibly rich diversity: of people, of cultures, of religions, of mineral resources, oil, and gas, an amazingly rich biodiversity, that should make us the envy of the world. We are blessed with abundantly diverse agro-ecologies, that should also make us a land of bountiful harvests with capacity to feed Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are a religious nation, so we should understand that God loves diversity. The diversity of rich and brilliant colours that we see in our forests, oceans, seas, and in flora and fauna, reflect the beauty of the Creator.\n\n\u201cTherefore, our diversity is not our problem. Diversity is our strength.\n\n\u201cBut when mismanaged, diversity becomes divergence. Rather than unite, we become splintered, with each entity believing that, somehow, it is better without the other.\u201d\n\nWhile urging Nigerians to learn from the Singaporean example, Mr Adesina urged Africa\u2019s most populous nation to manage its diversity well for the collective good of its people.\n\nThe AfDB President added, \u201cThe Singaporean society is based on meritocracy, not aristocracy or ethnocracy or religiocracy.\n\n\u201cAny society where meritocracy is subjugated to aristocracy, ethnocracy or religiocracy eventually tends towards mediocrity.\n\n\u201cNigeria must learn from this experience and forge a new way of engaging among its diverse ethnic groups and religions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNigeria must start managing its diversity for prosperity. We must drive for national cohesion, not ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cWe must address the fundamental reasons for agitations, by listening, understanding, removing prejudices, and allowing for open, national dialogues, without preconditions, but with one goal: build one cohesive, united, fair, just and equitable nation for all, not for a few or for any section of the nation or religion.\n\n\u201cA nation, unified by a sense of commonwealth, not a collage of ethnic nationalism. A nation driven by meritocracy, not ethnocracy, religiocracy or aristocracy.\u201d\n\nA total of 475 candidates graduated at the ceremony, earning undergraduate and graduate degrees \u2014 165 from the class of 2020 and 310 from the class of 2020.\n\nAmong the candidates was Mohammad Nasiru Yakubu, who became the first-ever doctorate degree graduate to be produced by the 17-year old university.\n\nAt the commencement ceremony were former Vice President Atiku Abubakar (founder of the university), Governors Simon Lalong of Plateau and Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa, former Senator Ben Obi (chairperson of the university\u2019s governing council), the Lamido Adamawa, Muhammadu Musdafa, among other dignitaries.\n\nEarlier on Friday night, the university held a lavish awards ceremony where outstanding graduating students were honoured for academic excellence, community service, leadership and sporting achievements.",

          "text": "John C. Maxwell, an American author and speaker, is a widely acknowledged thought leader. Maxwell asserts in one of his most famous quotes, which encapsulates the true essence of leadership, \u201cThe pessimist complains about the wind. The optimist expects it to change. The leader adjusts the sails\u201d.\n\nFidelity Bank CEO, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe is leading the financial institution through a significant evolution of business culture with the primary objective of improving operational efficiency and expanding market share. Mrs. Onyeali-Ikpe is adjusting \u201cthe sails\u201d to ensure that her colleagues at Fidelity Bank have the wind at their backs as they work toward common goals and individual successes.\n\nCurrently, Nneka has her sights fixed on positioning the bank as one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial institutions, which leverages automation and robotics to replace manual and repetitive processes. The global lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was a messenger unlike any other, signaling that Nigeria\u2019s traditional and over-the-counter banking systems are no longer viable.\n\nSince assuming office in January 1 2021, the bank\u2019s first female CEO and MD, has outlined a seven-point agenda to move the bank further in its quest to become a tier-1 bank that is well-positioned to outlive the competition and serve well into the future.\n\nOverview and timeline\n\nFidelity Bank\u2019s seven-point agenda focuses on brand architecture, brand building and refresh, talent development and transformation, product and service delivery, agility and performance discipline, digital transformation, and regulatory compliance.\n\nIn accordance with this, here are the bank\u2019s strategies for ensuring that it attains its objectives:\n\n1. The bank intends to embark on an Innovation Drive through the implementation of new processes, techniques. The bank is also executing fresh ideas to ensure continuous process improvement, reduce cost to serve, increase competitiveness, improve brand recognition and value, build new partnerships and relationships, drive turnover, and increase profitability.\n\n2. Brand refresh with the aim to increase top-of-mind awareness of the Fidelity brand by external and internal stakeholders.\n\n3. Workforce Transformation to create a future readily supported by a high performing and empowered workforce. This will be achieved by deepening the skills and competencies of staff across the bank, entrenching a culture of high performance, and embedding new ways of working in the bank. So far, the commencement of capacity building training for staff and senior management training are some of the initiatives implemented.\n\n4. Service Excellence which is intended to build brand loyalty through personalized and seamless customer experience delivery. This is already underway with the award-winning virtual assistant IVY. This revolutionary chatbot handles simple tasks like account opening to complex tasks such as complaint resolution, bill payment, transferring users to a live agent, loans, fixed deposit applications, and answering random questions.\n\n5. Digital Transformation involves an end-to-end digitization across all facets of the business. In line with this, the bank has launched a novel digital service \u2014Pay Yourself \u2014which revolutionized payday for salary earners and SMEs.\n\n6. Performance Discipline to ensure focus on strong fundamentals, asset quality, and strategic cost management. Initiatives already carried out in this regard include;\n\n\u2013 The Policy Familiarization Program \u2014a capacity-building project geared towards building a knowledgeable and versatile staff network/raising subject matter experts in all business areas that kicked off in March.\n\n\u2013 The One Culture Project- which was initiated to reinforce enabling behaviours and value systems towards fulfilling the bank\u2019s goals\n\n\u2013 Project Alpha- aimed at helping the bank develop a robust and holistic learning and development framework for all staff.\n\n7. Accelerated Growth which will drive aggressive market penetration and business diversification. This will be achieved through deeper penetration in key retail markets.\n\nOther initiatives geared towards deepening growth include; accelerated play in the SME segment, renewal of institutional banking, and drive for transaction-based propositions in corporate banking.\n\nWith this seven pronged agenda, Fidelity Bank is well on its way to leading the sector while revolutionizing Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape.",

          "text": "Dr. Muda Yusuf, the immediate past Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), has expressed worry about excess borrowing by the Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government in the midst of dwindling revenue.\n\nYusuf noted that a large portion of the domestic borrowing was through ways and means which has serious implications for inflation.\n\nWays and means is a mechanism for the government to borrow from the Central Bank under specified credit policy which, most times, entails printing money.\n\nYusuf who spoke at the Bi-Monthly Forum of the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) held at its national secretariat in Lagos on Thursday, as part of its capacity building programme, said that the borrowing spree of the Federal Government was hurting the economy as it escalates the already high rate of inflation in the country.\n\nHe disclosed that the facility usually comes at a huge cost to the taxpayer as the government paid N480 billion interest on the N1.8 trillion facility granted to it through the ways and means window between January and May 2021.\n\nHe expressed concern that government\u2019s excess borrowing has put pressure on the apex bank to exceed the \u201c5 percent ceiling of actual government revenue for the preceding year\u201d, specified in the CBN Act.\n\nAccording to him, the fast rate of money supply has adverse effects on the people\u2019s standard of living which has become a source of worry to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt has inflationary implications; it is not healthy for the economy because inflation erodes the value of people\u2019s income and affects their standard of living. The value of a currency has a lot to do with poverty and welfare. We must be worried about the fast rate of money supply because inflation triggers poverty,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cInflationary environment elevates production costs with adverse impact on corporate profitability, thereby making it increasingly difficult for businesses and corporates to meet their debt obligations to lending institutions. This translates into a significant increase in credit loss provisions with adverse impact on banks\u2019 profitability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to caution the government against being too dependent on the CBN for financing deficits because of the high inflationary impact. Inflation is a terrible thing. When people complain about hunger and poverty, it is because the money they have in their hands cannot buy anything much.\u201d\n\nDr Yusuf advised the government to prioritize its borrowing in the light of dwindling revenue, noting that up to 90 percent of the nation\u2019s revenue is committed to debt servicing which he said should be a major concern to the Nigerians.\n\nHe suggested rationalisation of spending as a way out of excess borrowing, noting that borrowing to fund recurrent expenditure is inimical to economic development.\n\nHe also advised the government to consider private partnership in funding projects that require huge capital outlay as well as selling idle assets to raise funds for building infrastructure.\n\nOn foreign exchange volatility, the immediate past LCCI boss noted that the foreign exchange market faced liquidity constraints in the first half of 2021, and that forex was inadequate to meet rising demand.\n\n\u201cThe supply of foreign exchange was inadequate to meet rising demand. The rate premium between the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate (NAFEX) and the parallel market rate averaged around 20 percent.\n\n\u201cSeveral businesses and corporates encountered difficulties in sourcing foreign exchange at the formal segment of the market and were forced to source the greenback at the parallel market.\n\n\u201cForeign exchange illiquidity aggravates investment risk which could negatively impact asset quality in the banking system. Foreign currency-denominated loans account for about between 30 percent and 35 percent of bank\u2019s loan book. Foreign exchange volatility is associated with risks relating to asset quality and financial stability.\u201d\n\nHe said that financial service institutions need a conducive business climate to create more avenues for investment and that more profitable asset classes are needed for profitable investments to take place.\n\nHe further stressed the need to address the structural, policy, institutional, and regulatory constraints in the business environment which would also result in a reduction in non-performing loans in the banking sector.\n\nDr Yusuf recalled that the banking industry demonstrated resilience amid disruptions associated with the pandemic, attributable to the policy intervention of the CBN.\n\n\u201cGoing by key ratios, the banking industry is financially stable and sound with industry capital adequacy and liquidity ratios above regulatory threshold while non-performing loan ratios is slightly above the five percent prudential guideline.\n\n\u201cCash reserve requirement remained elevated at 27.5 percent. A high CRR constrains banks from deploying funds into several profitable and productive ventures, thereby impacting their liquidity position.\u201d\n\nHe said that the current CRR environment negates policy that mandates banks to lend at least 65 percent of customer deposits to the real sector and advocating for a flexible CRR policy that would reflect the actual level of a bank\u2019s deposit at any time.\n\nHe projects a stable environment for banks and businesses in general in the second half of the year with recent developments such as the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill by the Ninth National Assembly after years of neglect.\n\n\u201cAlso, the National Assembly has passed the 2021 supplementary budget. The budget makes provision for vaccine procurement and security-related expenditures. Lawmakers have endorsed the move to raise $6.1 billion via the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cImprovement in current vaccination rate is expected to improve economic and business activities in the country, which is positive for the sustenance of growth recovery.\n\n\u201cInflation is expected to decelerate in the second half of the year on account of base effects and expectations of modest harvest, barring further exchange rate adjustment.\n\n\u201cWith the deceleration in inflation rate, monetary policymakers would be further encouraged to keep policy parameters at current levels. Relative stability is anticipated in the foreign exchange market as CBN sustains its intervention efforts,\u201d he said.",

The Government is implementing bold social programs to reduce the number of poor, through interventionist programs, but the fact of the matter is poverty is not just about money.\n\n\u201cThere is poverty of health, and yet we know that health is wealth.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has further revealed the weaknesses of Nigeria\u2019s health care systems. From diagnostic and testing centers, access to vaccines, and hospital infrastructure, the health care systems were overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cI commend the spirited efforts of the Federal and State governments, and the private sector, in mobilizing resources to tackle the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe African Development Bank provided $288.5 million to support the efforts of the Nigerian government in responding to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cBut we must go further. Nigeria must manufacture vaccines locally.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot to change to secure the health of the population.\n\n\u201cLess than 5% of the population have access to insurance with the National Health Insurance Service. Over 90% of Nigerians have no health insurance.\n\n\u201cYou can see the effects on the lives of people.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not living long compared to other countries. Life expectancy in Nigeria is only 60 years (2020), compared to 70 years in India, 81 years in the UK, 80 years in the US, 82 years in Norway, and 86 years in Singapore.\n\n\u201cNigeria should build a comprehensive health care defence system, to secure its population against the impacts of the current pandemic and future pandemics. There must be equal opportunities for all. Health is wealth. We must ensure that all have access to health care, regardless of the levels of income.\n\n\u201cAnd we must strongly support medical doctors, physicians, nurses and medical technologists, and remunerate them accordingly. They form the core of the health care system. We cannot have a situation where 56% of Nigeria\u2019s medical doctors are working outside of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to stem the tide by prioritising health of the people, and incentivising professionals in the health care system, from rural health clinics to the surgeons and physicians in secondary and tertiary health systems.\n\n\u201cNigeria should put in place incentives to harness the knowledge, skills, and resources of Nigerians in the diaspora, and invest massively in building Nigeria\u2019s health care infrastructure and systems.\n\n\u201cThere must be accountability for better lives for all Nigerians, regardless of their levels of income.\n\n\u201cThere cannot and should not be a Nigeria for the rich, and another Nigeria for the poor.\n\n\u201cWe must build one Nigeria, where every citizen has the right to a decent life.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better nation.\n\n\u201cWe must start building again, not splintering again.\n\n\u201cWe must re-build trust, equity, and social justice, to propel strong cohesiveness as a nation\u201d.\n\nAdesina also spoke about the need for Nigeria to invest in its youth.\n\n.",

          "title": "ICYMI: Shame on Northern Nigerians",
          "text": "By Dan Agbese\n\nA typical day and a typical news bulletin in northern Nigeria: \u201cBandits kill 21, burn houses in Katsina communities invasion;\u201d \u201cBandits hold 348 students, UNESCO sounds warning;\u201d \u201c83 FGC students held;\u201d \u201cBandits: we are holding 121 Kaduna school pupils.\u201d\n\nIn its issue of July 7, The Punch reported that \u201cthe total number of students being held by bandits has increased to 348 with the abduction of 121 students in Kaduna State. Out of the 348 students,\u201d the newspaper further reported, \u201c227 are still languishing in bandits\u2019 dens many weeks after they were abducted from their schools in Niger, Kebbi and Kaduna states.\u201d\n\nSpare a thought for what their parents are going through, wondering if indeed their children are alive. No one knows in what condition the children are being held. But there is some indication they are sleeping on the ground in the bush subjected to the harsh elements in the open. It is no way to bring up our future leaders.\n\nWe do not know how and if they are fed but they are likely from the dens emaciated. It should worry our leaders who tend to lean towards power without responsibility. The responsibility of power does not begin and end with building roads. It is more importantly about the welfare and the protection of the majority of the people. As Churchill once said, power without responsibility is the province of the harlot.\n\nIt(the kidnapping of children) should worry our leaders who tend to lean towards power without responsibility. The responsibility of power does not begin and end with building roads. It is more importantly about the welfare and the protection of the majority of the people. As Churchill once said, power without responsibility is the province of the harlot.\n\nThe bandits holding the Kaduna students had the temerity to ask for rice to feed their captives. Still, northern political leaders, the great men of the moment, cannot be counted on the side of the children and their parents. None of us can pretend not to be affected by what is happening to the region and its people. And let us not pretend about this. Northern Nigeria has surrendered to the reign of bandits in the full view and with the full knowledge of those who have the constitutional responsibility to make the region and indeed, the entire country safe. It is a huge shame on northern Nigerian leaders.\n\nThe region bleeds and has been bleeding from Boko Haram, bandits, Fulani herdsmen, kidnappers and sundry criminal elements. Still, the Nigerian state and its constituent units in northern Nigeria feel overwhelmed and weakened by their inability to find answers to the tragedy. Our political leaders, great winners of paid awards for good governance, must have some problems with the sacred responsibilities of governance. Resplendent in choice baban riga, they strut the political stage, uttering inane political sound bites but ignoring the plight of their own people. They object to power shifting to the south in 2023 and conveniently forget that their people are losers even as they hold the reins of power.\n\nI can find no reason and I can find no rhyme in the impossible situation and the existential threat we face. I can find no reason or rhyme for their cynical attitude towards the safety of the lives and the property of the people. There are many things we do not understand in and about our country but the current situation must rank as the worst case of a riddle wrapped in a puzzle. It befuddles the mind; it passeth all understanding. Those who believe they have the right to be listened to are never tired of preaching the gospel of patriotism to the people. They forget that patriotism is reciprocal. A country that neglects its people has no moral right to expect the people to be patriotic.\n\nWhen ISWAP captured one American not too long ago, the country deployed its forces and rescued him from his captors in Niger Republic. It is a typical example of a government that fully understands that the life of one citizen lost to a state or non-state actors takes something away from its constitutional obligation to protect all Americans wherever they might be. The U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists but then it does not create room for such negotiation. It rescues its citizens and send their captors to hell.\n\nPerhaps in the near future, sociologists would study these times and tell future generations of northerners why governments instituted by the people for the people abandoned the people to their fate in the hands of criminals. Here is part of the tragedy. We are told that the federal and state governments do not negotiate with terrorists, including bandits; yet the same governments allow the poor, helpless parents of the kidnapped children to negotiate with the bandits. It just does not add up.\n\nHere is part of the tragedy. We are told that the federal and state governments do not negotiate with terrorists, including bandits; yet the same governments allow the poor, helpless parents of the kidnapped children to negotiate with the bandits. It just does not add up.\n\nDoes that not undermine the so-called policy of non-negotiation? It is hypocrisy at its lowest level. It should not be the business of the parents to negotiate with the terrorists. If the governments are not willing to negotiate with them and secure the release of the children in safety, then they must have an alternative strategy that would achieve the same purpose and effect the release of the children.\n\nPresident Buhari has said it a good number of times that the Federal Government has massive power it could deploy to defeat the bandits and other terrorists but despite his repeated warning to them not to take his non-action against them as a sign of weakness, he has refused to deploy this massive power. I thought the state funded the purchase of the arms and ammunitions and the training of the security personnel for times like these. I wonder if the bandits are not laughing, knowing all too well that while the governments would not negotiate with them, the harried parents will and they will achieve the same purpose by collecting huge ransom from the parents.\n\nIt is impossible for anyone who sees these parents scraping for a kobo here and a kobo there to raise money to meet the demands of the bandits not to be affected by the tragedy that befell them and their children.\n\nThey sent their children to school to give them a better future. They cannot understand why that path to their better future is either blocked or threatened by criminals. They cannot understand why their children have been turned into a means of making quick and illegal money while the governments dither, biting their nails in a typical display of weakness. They certainly cannot understand why the governments they instituted to make their lives and those of their children better are making things worse, much worse for them and their children. Nor can they understand why federal and state governments would choose to subject them to this trauma that deepens their helplessness and hopelessness and turn the rainbow of hope in the horizon into the dark clouds of an arrested future. Shame.\n\nThey cannot understand why their children have been turned into a means of making quick and illegal money while the governments dither, biting their nails in a typical display of weakness. They certainly cannot understand why the governments they instituted to make their lives and those of their children better are making things worse, much worse for them and their children. Nor can they understand why federal and state governments would choose to subject them to this trauma that deepens their helplessness and hopelessness and turn the rainbow of hope in the horizon into the dark clouds of an arrested future. Shame.\n\nThere is no way one can put it less indelicately: it is a shame on our governments and our political leaders who sought the mandate of the people, not to lead them into the gutter or abandon them there but to make their lives meaningful to them. But here we are: while the good times roll for our political leaders, the rough times roll for the people; while the leaders are protected by a phalanx of security men and women, the people are at the mercy of criminals who profit from the cynical attitude of our leaders towards us. The people are unsafe anywhere and everywhere \u2013 at home, in offices and on the roads. It could not be worse for the giant of Africa.\n\nPerhaps, the federal and the state governments in northern Nigeria should pause now and give some serious thoughts to their gallant development efforts and re-examine their objectives. What is the use of modern highways the people cannot make use of because they are dangerous and unsafe? What is the use of building primary and secondary schools and planting universities if the federal and state governments cannot guarantee the safety of the pupils and the students?\n\nit is a shame on our governments and our political leaders who sought the mandate of the people, not to lead them into the gutter or abandon them there but to make their lives meaningful to them. But here we are: while the good times roll for our political leaders, the rough times roll for the people; while the leaders are protected by a phalanx of security men and women, the people are at the mercy of criminals who profit from the cynical attitude of our leaders towards us. The people are unsafe anywhere and everywhere \u2013 at home, in offices and on the roads. It could not be worse for the giant of Africa.\n\nDevelopment is about making lives better for the people. As I said earlier, governance and its enormous responsibilities are about what is best for the people. It is not about mouthing slogans and ignoring the full protection of the rights of the people to live in safety and carry on with their legitimate businesses in their country. It was good to storm Sunday Igboho\u2019s residence; it was good to arrest Nnamdi Kanu. Why does the same determination appear to be absent in saving our children from bandits? Since the actions against them for putting their fingers in the eyes of the Nigerian state, the roads in northern Nigeria have not become safer nor have schools in northern Nigeria become safer.\n\nCivilisation may follow the roads, as the Romans contended, but human development follows security of lives and property. It was no accident that the framers of our constitution made this as the number one responsibility the state must discharge towards its citizens. The failure to do so delegitimises the government. Let the northerners rise now and save their region, its future and the future of their young people. And end the shame of weakness.\n\n*Dan Agbese, veteran journalist and one of the founders of Newswatch wrote this piece originally for The Guardian.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Baptist Convention has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government, claiming that this is the first time a Baptist school has been attacked by robbers and kids kidnapped in its 166-year history.\n\nFollowing the kidnapping of 121 students from Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State, the Nigerian Baptist Convention announced that prayers would be held in all Baptist churches in Nigeria and around the world.\n\nThe President, Nigerian Baptist Convention, Rev Israel Akanji, said this in an interview with PUNCH on Friday, which he said was the last day of the Baptist World Alliance.\n\nAkanji said the alliance comprised 127 countries globally and that the event was held via Zoom, a virtual meeting platform.\n\nThe clergy said the 127 countries that make up the Baptist World Alliance were informed of the abduction of students of the Bethel Baptist High School.\n\nAsked what efforts the Baptist Church had made so far, the clergy said, \u201cYou know that we are a church, and once we are in any difficulty, the first port of call is to ask God in prayer. Therefore, we have been organizing prayer all over the Baptist Church in Nigeria and worldwide.\n\n\u201cIn terms of publicity (of the abduction), all over Nigeria, it is known. Every state is aware, and the Baptist World Alliance is also aware.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Elijah Brown, the General Secretary of the Baptist World Alliance, has made a kind of press statement in which he spoke about the abduction of the students in Nigeria. He condemned this act that has been going on in Nigeria and especially the kidnapping of the students of our Baptist High School.\u201d\n\nDespite the attack, Akanji said the Baptist Church would not be intimidated, noting that the Church would continue to provide quality education. According to him, the Baptist Church has for the past 166 years operated secondary schools in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Baptist denomination has given education to Nigeria since 1855. For 166 years now, the Nigerian Baptist Convention has been providing education.\n\n\u201cOur first institution is the Baptist Academy in Lagos, which is still an institution to reckon with today and has produced great men and women for Nigeria. The Baptist Boys High School in Abeokuta, Ogun State, produced Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and the late Chief MKO Abiola. These are people who greatly impacted Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNow, in our history, this is the first time in 166 years that a Baptist school would be raided and the students kidnapped. It had never happened. So we believe in the strength of our history. By calling the Almighty God, our students shall be returned to us.\n\n\u201cHaving called on God and our track record as a denomination providing education for this nation without ceasing for 166 years, our students should be brought back,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Raja Casablanca won the Caf Confederation Cup with a 2-1 victory over JS Kabylie on Saturday evening.\n\nFirst-half goals from Soufiane Rahimi and Ben Malango Ngita were all the Green Eagles needed to emerge as winners inside Cotonou\u2019s Stade de l\u2019Amitie.\n\nAlthough they played the last 27 minutes with a man less following the dismissal of Omar Arjoune for a dangerous play, Lassaad Chabbi\u2019s men held their nerves to win the competition for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Moroccans came into the game with low morale \u2013 having failed to win any of their last three games in all competitions. However, they reigned supreme thanks to a commanding showing in the first 45 minutes.\n\nAlthough the game got off to a cagey start, it was Raja Casablanca who drew first blood through a brilliant individual effort by Rahimi in the fifth minute.\n\nProfiting from a shambolic defending from the Lions of Djurdjura, the striker controlled a pass from Arjoune, rounded goalkeeper Oussama Benbot before slotting into an empty net.\n\nSouth African referee Victor Gomes had cancelled the goal for an offside, albeit, VAR replays adjudged that the effort was legitimate.\n\nThat goal was a reality check for Denis Lavagne\u2019s men, but they were unable to restore parity as their strikers were found wanting in the final third.\n\nIn the 14th minute, the Botola Pro giants doubled their advantage with a simple finish from Ben Malango. Oussama Soukhane made an overlapping run through opponents\u2019 backline before sending a cross to the Congolese \u2013 who had the honour of firing into the bottom left of Benbot.\n\nJS Kabylie\u2019s first attempt to score came four minutes later. Nonetheless, Rida Bensayah\u2019s fierce shot was punched over the crossbar by goalkeeper Anas Zniti.\n\nA minute into the second half, the Algerians reduced the deficit as Zakaria Boulahia fired a rebound past Zniti after the ball fell to him in the box.\n\nIt appeared they would equalise as Chabbi\u2019s men were reduced to ten after Arjoune was given the marching orders for viciously stamping Juba Oukaci\u2019s face in the 63rd minute.\n\nHe was initially cautioned by Gomes, however, that decision was upturned for a red card after VAR checks.\n\nDespite profiting from a numerical advantage, JS Kabylie were unable to launch a comeback as they paid for their wastefulness.\n\nThanks to their triumph, the Moroccans will play either Al Ahly or Kaizer Chiefs in the Caf Super Cup.",

ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE in this report x-ray the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and the dark clouds over the leading opposition party.\n\nGovernor of Ebonyi state Dave Umahi left the party last year; the governor of Cross River state, Ben Ayade, also defected to the APC not long ago and only last week, a PDP senator, Peter Nwaoboshi, followed the same route. On June 29, 2021, the Zamfara state governor, Bello Muhammad Matawalle, left the PDP for the APC. Also, all the 24 members of the House of Assembly as well as the three senators and six out of the seven members of the House of Representatives defected to the APC.\n\nNot long ago, the senator representing Delta North Federal Constituency, Peter Nwaoboshi, defected from the leading opposition party to the APC. In Cross River state, thousands of PDP members in Abi local government area, which is the constituency of former Governor Liyel Imoke, defected to the APC. Significantly, after dumping their umbrella for the broom, the crowd proceeded to conduct a symbolic burial of the PDP by setting ablaze a coffin draped in the party\u2019s colours.\n\nOn Wednesday, the last and only PDP member in the House, Jonathan Gaza, who represents Keffi/Karu/Kokona federal constituency of Nasarawa state, also dumped the party for the APC.\n\nAs these defections continue, especially from the opposition to the ruling party, it has brought about a sense of panic in the opposition ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nPDP\u2019s excuses\n\nIn his reaction, the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, said those who left were intimidated by the instrument of the APC-led federal government. Addressing journalists at a meeting of party leaders recently, Secondus, however, said the PDP would win the presidential election in 2023 \u201cbecause the masses are with the party.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me also emphasise that APC governors and the government of APC are overbearing on the system and moving to poach our governors and this to them is regarded as an achievement. I have never seen where you have an economic crisis, insecurity crisis, then the ruling party poaching governors.\n\n\u201cThey are going after our governors, but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote each, but we are after the people, the masses. The masses are solidly behind us; the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form this new government coming in 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame for all the governors that left the PDP for fear. They were intimi\u00addated by the instrument of this government, but I\u2019m hap\u00adpy that the masses in their states especially in Zamfara have not left.\u201d\n\nBuhari gives reasons\n\nOn his part, President Muhammadu Buhari who congratulated Governor Matawalle on his defection to the APC, governors and other politicians for joining the ruling party, saying it\u2019s \u201cbecoming more popular and because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.\u201d\n\nIn a message delivered on his behalf by the secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, at the defection ceremony in Gusau, President Buhari said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to re-build Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nA statement by his presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, further quoted the president as urging APC governors and elected lawmakers across the country \u201cto continue to work harder to ensure our party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.\u201d\n\nHe reminded all elected party officials that their \u201cperformance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party,\u201d adding that \u201cparty leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.\u201d\n\nGombe gov\u2019s take\n\nReacting, the Gombe state governor, Inuwa Yahaya, who ruled out the possibility of the country heading to a one-party system, said PDP members were moving in droves to APC \u201cbecause the ruling party is more transparent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with one of our reporters, the governor said Nigerians should expect more political parties coming up to join the existing ones as soon as they meet INEC\u2019s requirements and constitutional provisions.\n\nHe said, \u201cA party that is in control necessarily has to attract people that are ready to give their support and they are coming because they realise that APC is more solid, more on the ground and more transparent and open in terms of how it deals with everybody; the high and the low. That is why they are coming; so, we welcome them and anybody that says no should have a re-think because the party is about people and all politicians are invited and welcome to any party that they think belongs to the right track. That is what APC is.\u201d\n\nEx-Edo commissioner\u2019s view\n\nIn his view, a one-time Commissioner for Information in Edo state, Prince Kassim Afegbua, said the continuous defection of governors from PDP to APC was a testimony to the leadership \u201ctactlessness and spinelessness of the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC.\u201d\n\nAfegbua, therefore, called for the sack of Secondus, warning that the \u201cugly trend if not addressed portends doom and could lead to the collapse of the party.\u201d He, in a recent statement, said, \u201cWhen I raised the alarm two months ago about the gradual decimation of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the Uche Secondus leadership, many had thought I was raising dust over nothing.\n\n\u201cThe events of the last one month and the continuing defection of major PDP stakeholders to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is a further testimony to the leadership tactlessness and spinelessness of the Secondus-led NWC of the party.\u201d\n\nThe statement partly read \u201cIt should be of urgent concern to all stakeholders and organs of the party, including the Governors\u2019 Forum, to arrest this obvious drift which has left our dear party naked before Nigerians, home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThere is a more compelling need to urgently call for a stakeholders\u2019 meeting to mitigate, amongst other things, this obvious decimation of the PDP by a leadership that is utterly bereft of ideas, confused, intellectually hollow, phlegmatic and absentminded in the affairs of the nation and the party.\n\n\u201cAn opposition party that should be gaining momentum because of the leadership failures of the ruling APC is at best losing some of her best hands across the nation and losing the much-needed momentum.\n\n\u201cAll these defections portend bad omen for an opposition party that should gain maximum mileage under a system that has been run aground by the menacing incompetence of the APC-led federal government. On a regular basis, critical stakeholders are defecting to the APC, such bile in the dish.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s opinion\n\nA public affairs analyst, Samuel James, said with the gale of defections, the chances of the PDP to win the 2023 elections \u201care becoming slimmer.\u201d\n\nIn a phone chat with Blueprint, James said, \u201cWe all know that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is still evolving. In most cases, it is difficult for a ruling party to lose a state that it\u2019s in control of. So, the more states a party controls, the better chances they are to get to win the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAPC has more governors and more states; out of the 36 States, PDP is in control of 13 while the APC is in control of 22. It simply means that APC is already leading PDP with nine states, from where they can use their governors to make a big difference in the 2023 general elections. So, with all these, the 2023 chances of the party are becoming slimmer.\u201d\n\nPDP scribe\u2019s assurances\n\nDefiantly, the PDP deputy national publicity secretary, Diran Odeyemi, said the party was not losing sleep over the defections of its members.\n\nOdeyemi, in an interview with Blueprint Weekend, said PDP would win the 2023 elections \u201cbecause of the suffering, corruption and the level of insecurity Nigerians are experiencing under the APC administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not losing sleep. We are not, because a political party generally is like an open door and nobody closes it. People can come in and people can go. Since the election will be taking place in 2023, we believe a lot of repairs would have been done for us to win the presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win the election based on three advocacies: Number 1, virtually all Nigerians have joined PDP in opposing the government of APC. With the suffering, inflation, corruption and with insecurity, everybody has become opposed to this government. So, we believe that Nigeria can not afford to continue suffering. As a result, they are going to vote for the PDP.\n\n\u201cNumber 2, PDP as a political party is going to present a candidate whose performances would have won about 50 per cent of the votes. We are seriously working on this and as soon as we come up with our candidate, Nigerians will clap for us. Finally, we believe as a party we don\u2019t have an internal crisis that will warrant anybody defecting. So, we hope and anticipate that we will reap from their crisis very soon.\u201d\n\nAn expert\u2019s outburst\n\nStating reasons for the defection of PDP governors, a political analyst, Jide Ojo, said \u201cnemesis is catching up with the party for its 16 years of misrule.\u201d\n\nOjo, in a phone chat with our reporter, lamented that, \u201cWe are gravitating towards a one-party state. That is the irony of this whole thing, because we were hoping we are having a de facto two-party system as you have in other democracies like in the UK, where you have the conservative and the labour parties; in the US where you have the republicans and the democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen people have a desire, they will go after it. Yes, about the argument that Uche Secondus needs to go for peace to reign, there are allegations of corruption and embezzlement against him by some members. But then PDP is not new to such controversies.\n\n\u201cThe defections are a nemesis that is catching up with PDP. 16 years in the government; recall how PDP also poached the governors of the opposition to strengthen its hold on power. So, it\u2019s now being treated the way they treated other parties in the past.\u201d\n\nAny way out?\n\nOn the way out for the party to militate against consistent detections, Ojo said, \u201cIt must show beyond just parroting; it must show that it is a born again party. You know part of the problems of the PDP was the imposition of candidates as well as the lack of internal democracy. Look at what happened in their governorship primary election in Anmabra state. Also, remember the South-west zonal congress held in Osun state, it was fraught with vote-padding and other corrupt practices. One wouldn\u2019t have expected that to be happening in the PDP, especially with Secondus apologising for their 16-year misrule, pledging that they had turned a new leaf.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s left for them to do some house-keeping, pursue the rule of law, pursue pro- people policy, and let their governors, senators and representatives be seen to be different.\n\n\u201cThey need to review the party; the chances of the party to win 2023 elections are getting slimmer. They can review their activities as a party and re-build the party; they should make sure their congresses from ward to local government, state and ultimately to the national convention are credible; that will throw up credible candidates.\n\n\u201cIf they can re-build and follow rule of law, if credible candidates emerge from their primaries and they shun money politics, then the party will become attractive to politicians of note.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s view, BMO\u2019s expose\n\nAn analyst, Musa Ilallah, writing from Maitama, Abuja, noted that the recent defections of top-notch PDP members point to the fact that PDP is gradually losing its grip as a leading opposition party in the country, having failed to provide a mature, foresighted approach as a credible opposition.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) in a signed statement by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, \u201cAnd just like that exodus signposted PDP\u2019s loss at the centre in 2015, the latest one is a harbinger of what the opposition party should expect in 2023, especially as APC is evolving into a truly ideological political powerhouse built on integrity.\u201d\n\nIlallah noted further that, \u201cThe high-profile defections and other massive defections of middle and low-level PDP members to the ruling APC explains in unambiguous terms that PDP has failed as a ruling party up to May 29, 2015, and now as an opposition party.\n\n\u201cNon-performance, massive looting and inability of the PDP to deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigerians while in power, despite the enormous funds at its disposal, and lacking the capacity to be a good opposition party have further confirmed that PDP is a sinking ship.\n\n\u201cToday, there is a twist in the narration as opposition members of the PDP are moving massively into the fold of the ruling APC. We are really and truly living in interesting political times.\n\n\u201cThe greater secret about the mass exodus of PDP members to APC is largely attributable to the integrity, maturity and selflessness of the President that he has brought to bear on governance and party politics in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cAll hope is not lost for PDP to reclaim its leadership role as Africa\u2019s largest opposition party and perhaps return to power in 2023, if it sits up and does the needful. Time is certainly not on its side.\u201d",

My experience with the police has been very bad since they see cases reported to them as opportunities to make wealth from them.\n\nI thank God for the success made so far, knowing how difficult and expensive it is to get justice in this country. Recently, I was at the Force Headquarters in Abuja in respect to my complaint against one Sergeant Iorember Ade who, towards the end of 2016, assaulted my sister, Queen, an assault that led to her death. This same issue was reported to the National Human Rights Commission\u2019s office in Abuja, but nothing reasonable was done to ensure that justice is served.\n\nWhile at the Force Headquarters, the IPO handling my sister\u2019s case, who refused to disclose his real name to me, maintained that I will be addressing him as IK, had a serious argument with his colleagues on who should handle my case. One among the police officers complained he has not been getting money aside from his salary, and that he won\u2019t continue to allow IK to take over cases that come to their unit. I was shocked that they could not even mind my presence.\n\nThe argument lasted for almost an hour before I was attended to by Mr. IK. While attending to me, IK made some funny requests that I would pay for the hotel accommodation for two Police Officers who would be going to Makurdi, Benue State capital to investigate my case since the incident took place there. He also demanded that I would pay for their transport fare and their feeding. Thereafter, he asked me how much I thought I could give to cover all he mentioned. I was not surprised because I knew he saw my case as an opportunity for him to make money and supplement his salary. I told him I didn\u2019t have money, and that was the end of my case. I have not heard from the police since then.\n\nI reported this attitude to the National Human Rights Commission in Abuja official who claimed to be following my case to ensure I get justice but as usual, nothing was done till now. My questions are these: how can we progress in this country with the kind of police we have? How can we get things done with the kind of government agencies that are not functioning? Human Rights exist only by name, and so other agencies of government because they are not doing anything reasonable, they collect money from the government. Sometimes in a day, I get not less than 10 calls from people in different parts of the country, reporting issues to me after reading my publications in the newspapers on similar issues that have been their problems.\n\nIf these agencies of government are working, can people be calling an ordinary person to report cases to him? A staff of FCMB came to me to assist recover his money from a Police Inspector after the police officer claimed they don\u2019t know the whereabouts of the Inspector, and they won\u2019t be able to follow him up and recover the money from him. The telephone number of the Inspector and other details about him were provided, yet, police did not know how to follow up on this case. I eventually collected the telephone number of the officer in question and spoke with him. Within Two weeks, he paid the money (N50,000) in question to the staff of FCMB, Mr. Mathew Nyoir.",

When calling for Mr. Spears to be removed in November last year, Mr. Ingham said Ms. Spears, 39, was scared of her father and wanted him gone from the conservatorship that has controlled her life since 2008.\n\nIn court filings, Ms. Spears said she wanted private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust appointed as \u201csole conservator\u201d. However, documents filed in Los Angeles show Judge Brenda Penny refused the request while rubberstamping Bessemer Trust\u2019s role as co-conservator of the estate. The legal document states: \u201cThe conservatee\u2019s request to suspend James P Spears immediately upon the appointment of Bessemer Trust Company Of California, N.A. as sole conservator of the estate is denied without prejudice.\u201d The filing was dated June 30 \u2013 a week after the pop superstar delivered dramatic testimony calling for the end of the conservatorship.\n\nShe was placed under the complex legal arrangement \u2013 usually reserved for the very old and infirm \u2013 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns. Ms. Spears told a court on June 23 the conservatorship was \u201cabusive\u201d and she wanted it to end without the need for a medical assessment.

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s ruling party has won a landslide in a landmark parliamentary poll, results showed Saturday, ensuring a new five-year term for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed despite a brutal war in the northern region of Tigray.\n\nAbiy hailed the outcome of what he described as a \u201chistoric\u201d election \u2014 the first time he faced voters since being appointed prime minister in 2018 following several years of anti-government protests.\n\nThe winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize had hoped to frame victory at the ballot box as a mandate for political and economic reforms and military operations.\n\nBut the poll was held in the midst of the gruelling conflict in Tigray region that has battered Abiy\u2019s global reputation and raised fears of widespread famine.\n\nHis Prosperity Party won more than 400 seats out of a total of 436 where elections were held, according to results issued by the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE).\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, Abiy described it as a historically inclusive election, adding: \u201cOur party is also happy that it has been chosen by the will of the people to administer the country.\u201d\n\nThe vote was meant to affirm a promised democratic revival in Africa\u2019s second-most populous nation, with Abiy vowing a clean break with repression that tarnished past electoral cycles.\n\nThe ruling coalition that preceded him claimed staggering majorities in 2015 and 2010 polls that observers said fell far short of international standards for fairness.\n\nA more open contest in 2005 saw big opposition gains but led to a lethal crackdown on protests over contested results.\n\nTwice delayed polls\n\nThis time, the polls were delayed twice \u2014 once for the coronavirus pandemic, and again to allow officials longer to prepare.\n\nBut even with the extra time voting did not go ahead in around one-fifth of the country\u2019s 547 constituencies. A second batch of voting is due to take place on September 6 in many of those left out because of ethnic violence or logistical problems.\n\nBut there is no election date set for Tigray, where fighting marked by myriad atrocities raged for eight months before federal troops withdrew at the end of June in the face of rebel advances and Abiy\u2019s government declared a unilateral ceasefire.\n\nThe announcement of final results was also later than expected because of delayed counts and complaints by political parties.\n\nMuted campaign\n\nThe situation remains precarious in Tigray, with analysts warning of potential further fighting and some world leaders denouncing a \u201csiege\u201d blocking desperately-needed aid for a region where hundreds of thousands face famine.\n\nThe World Food Programme said Saturday it was sending 50 trucks of aid into Tigray. It was not clear if it had arrived.\n\nCampaigning was muted even in some areas where voting did take place, with opposition parties complaining of a tilted playing field.\n\nIn Abiy\u2019s native Oromia region, Ethiopia\u2019s largest, two of the most prominent opposition parties \u2014 the Oromo Federalist Congress and the Oromo Liberation Front \u2014 pulled out entirely, saying their candidates had been arrested and offices vandalised.\n\nThe most competitive regions were Amhara, the country\u2019s second-largest, and the capital Addis Ababa.\n\nElection day saw \u201cno serious or widespread human rights violations\u201d in stations observed by the state-affiliated Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\n\nYet in a preliminary report the EHRC noted some constituencies experienced \u201cimproper arrests\u201d, voter intimidation and \u201charassment\u201d of observers and journalists.\n\nThe EHRC also said it had observed several killings in the days leading up the vote in Oromia.\n\n\u2018Deep political cleavages\u2019\n\nThe opposition National Movement for Amhara filed a complaint to the electoral board over \u201cserious problems\u201d during the vote.\n\n\u201cA lot of our observers were beaten and chased down by militias of the ruling party,\u201d senior party member Dessalegn Chanie told AFP.\n\nThe official results showed opposition parties and independent candidates winning a small number of seats.\n\nEven low opposition representation in parliament could fend off future instability, said Addisu Lashitew of the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\n\u201cPeople, especially the youth, they need to be heard, so they should have a voice in the political process,\u201d Addisu said. \u201cEven if it may not be always successful in influencing political decisions, the fact that they are heard itself is important.\u201d\n\nIncorporating opposition voices into formal political processes means they are less likely to become \u201cradicalised\u201d or spur a large-scale protest movement, he added.\n\nThe Prosperity Party \u201cshouldn\u2019t read too much\u201d into the results given the \u201cdeep political cleavages\u201d that remain, Tegbaru Yared, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, wrote this week.\n\nInstead the party \u201cshould focus on stabilising the country, stopping intercommunal conflicts, managing inflation, engaging the opposition and initiating an all-inclusive national dialogue,\u201d Tegbaru wrote. \u201cThis could earn it popular legitimacy.\u201d\n\nAFP",

And so it went well. I\u2019m optimistic.\u201d\n\nThe message Mr Biden said he had delivered on Friday was similar to the message that he brought when the two leaders held their first face-to-face meeting last month in Switzerland.\n\nSince then, the Russian or Eastern European based REvil hacking group unleashed a massive attack that caused outages across the globe.\n\nThe hacking placed increased pressure on Mr Biden to do something to counter the threats.\n\nDuring Mr Biden\u2019s meeting in Geneva last month, he provided the Russians with a list of 16 sectors that must not be attacked.",

          "title": "\u2018We Need Help\u2019: Haiti\u2019s Interim Leader Requests US Troops",
          "text": "Haiti\u2019s interim government said it asked the U.S. to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare the way for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s assassination.\n\n\u201cWe definitely need assistance and we\u2019ve asked our international partners for help,\u201d Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. \u201cWe believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.\u201d\n\nThe stunning request for U.S. military support recalled the tumult following Haiti\u2019s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation \u2014 which lasted nearly two decades \u2014 as a way to avert anarchy.\n\nBut the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to assist with the ongoing investigation into a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff.\n\nOn Friday, a group of lawmakers declared loyalty and recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti\u2019s dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government\u2019s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Mo\u00efse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government.\n\nJoseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder for political gain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in a power struggle,\u201d said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. \u201cThere\u2019s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that\u2019s through elections.\u201d\n\nJoseph spoke as more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of murky, international conspiracy involving a Hollywood actor, a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy and a private security firm operating out of a cavernous warehouse in Miami.\n\nAmong those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed what they described as more than a dozen \u201cmercenaries\u201d who were former members of Colombia\u2019s military.\n\nSome of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan\u2019s Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief L\u00e9on Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought.\n\nThe attack, which took place at Mo\u00efse\u2019s home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. Joseph said he has spoken to the first lady but out of respect for her mourning has not inquired about the attack.\n\nColombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. U.S.-trained Colombian soldiers are heavily sought after by private security firms and mercenary armies in global conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and powerful drug cartels.\n\nIn an unexplainable twist would\u2019ve surely outed any highly sensitive mission, some of the men posted on Facebook photos of themselves visiting the presidential palace and other tourist spots in the Dominican Republic, which shares Hispaniola Island with Haiti.\n\nThe sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday \u2014 hours after Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder \u2014 when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.\n\n\u201cHe told me not to tell our mother, so she wouldn\u2019t worry,\u201d said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears.\n\nIt\u2019s not known who masterminded the attack. And numerous questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president\u2019s residence posing as U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president.\n\nCapador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti.\n\nCapador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security \u2014 a previously unknown company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants.\n\nThe wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia\u2019s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month \u2014 a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, non-commissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their retirement pensions.\n\nUribe is under investigation for his alleged role in the murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 that he tried to present as someone killed in combat, part of a spate of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia\u2019s U.S.-trained army more than a decade ago.\n\nCTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some of them since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp.\n\nCTU\u2019s website lists two addresses, one of which was a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other was a small suite under a different company\u2019s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist at the office said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother\u2019s reputation does not remain like it is,\u201d said Capador. \u201cHe was a humble, hard-working man. He had honours and decorations.\u201d\n\nBesides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans.\n\nInvestigative Judge Cl\u00e9ment No\u00ebl told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Mo\u00efse, not kill him. No\u00ebl said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday.\n\nSolages, 35, described himself as a \u201ccertified diplomatic agent,\u201d an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his home town of Jacmel, on Haiti\u2019s southern coast.\n\nHe worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His Facebook page, which was also taken down following news of his arrest, features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag.\n\nCalls to the charity and Solages\u2019 associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages doesn\u2019t have any military training and doesn\u2019t believe he was involved in the killing.\n\n\u201cI feel like my son killed my brother because I love my president and I love James Solages,\u201d Schubert Dorisme, whose wife is Solages\u2019 aunt, told WPLG in Miami.\n\nJoseph refused to finger any attackers but said that Mo\u00efse had earned numerous enemies while attacking powerful oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts.\n\nSome of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and well-known businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate president Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors early next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged.\n\nAnalysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. Even before Mo\u00efse\u2019s murder, Port-au-Prince already had been on edge due to the growing power of gangs that displaced more than 14,700 people last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.\n\nProsecutors also want to interrogate members of Mo\u00efse\u2019s security detail, including the president\u2019s security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri H\u00e9rard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.\n\n\u201cIf you are responsible for the president\u2019s security, where have you been?,\u201d Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. \u201cWhat did you do to avoid this fate for the president?\u201d",

We won\u2019t move forward if we don\u2019t have a clear date on signing and return,\u201d he told participants at the round-table. \u201dFull return should be completed in a year, not beyond August 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said Nigerians were eagerly awaiting the return of the 1,130 Benin Bronzes, which are being held by various museums in Germany.\n\nThe German government is coordinating the return of the Benin Bronzes, which are mostly held by state and private museums. Of the 6,600 museums in Germany, less than five per cent are owned by the government.\n\nSpeaking at the roundtable, the Secretary of State in the German President\u2019s office, Mr. Stephen Steinlein, said the President was happy with the progress made so far on the planned repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nHe described the planned return of the artefacts as \u201da lighthouse project\u201d and assured that the President would continue to follow the process keenly.\n\nWork is set to begin on the building of a museum, tagged Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), in Benin City that will hold the artefacts when they are repatriated.\n\nThe Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who is also part of the Nigerian delegation, told the roundtable that the museum \u201cis part of a transformation project\u201d being planned to make Benin City a cultural hub.\n\nThe architect handling the museum project, Sir David Adjaye, made a presentation to the roundtable, during which he said the project would fuse the technology of ancient Benin Kingdom to that of the 21st century to get an organic pavilion that will boast of an auditorium, storage, as well as exhibition space, among other facilities.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Nigerian delegation met with representatives of Ethnologisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem, where a select number of Benin Bronzes, some of them dating back to the 16th century, were on display.\n\nOther members of the Nigerian delegation included the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar; the Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Prof. Abba Tijani; Benin Crown Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare and Mr. Phillip Ihenacho, Director of the Board, Legacy Restoration Trust.",

If he is here, I will ask him if that was not what we agreed upon. The international community must also know this.\n\n\u201cI will ask for prayer for the governor because it seems there are some unscrupulous people behind this arrangement, who might be doing it for financial gain.\u201d\n\nThe Oba said he discussed with the Minister of Information and Culture on the direct repatriation of the artefacts to Benin Kingdom from where they were stolen.\n\nHe added that the federal government should take custody of the artefacts and not to hand it over to a private company or the state government, until the Benin Royal Palace Museum was built.\n\nAccording to the Oba, \u201cThankfully just yesterday I spoke with the Hon. Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed who is presently in Germany over the negotiation with the German Government over the plans for the repatriation of our artefacts. He assured me that the federal government remains committed to unconditional return of our artefacts and will guarantee their full custody for their onward transmission to Benin Kingdom to the exclusion of any unauthorised private entities or third parties.\n\n\u201cWe once again thank the federal government for this commitment. It now behoves on the federal government to be the only level of government that can take custody of the artefacts with a view to transferring them to their original owner and their original place of abode, more so that there exist international treaties and laws guiding these processes.\u201d\n\nThe Oba said he also discussed the destination of the expected artefacts with Obaseki, stating that they reached an understanding that the Palace would be in charge, but that he was surprised by his recent position.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that shortly after my ascension to the throne, I had several discussions with the governor on the plan for the Benin Royal Museum and he expressed his readiness to work with the Palace to actualise this laudable wish of my father. I made efforts and acquired additional plots of land from different families within the Adesogbe area near the present day palace for this purpose.\n\n\u201cI was, however, surprised to read from the Governor\u2019s letter to the Palace where reference was being made to the fact that a new Museum to be known as EMOWAA is now being proposed, which will be funded and executed through the vehicle of another body now referred to as Legacy Restoration Trust.\n\n\u201cWhen Governor Godwin Obaseki informed me in his correspondence of another implementation framework using the so-called Legacy Restoration Trust and the Edo Museum of West Africa Arts (EMOWAA), my response was that the setting up of another organisation or legal entity in whatever form or guise will not be necessary or acceptable.\n\n\u201cI informed him that Oba Ewuare II Foundation has been registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and has worked out a framework for not only receiving the artefacts but also building a modern structure \u2013 The Benin Royal Museum \u2013 within the precincts of the Palace and that land has been secured for the building of the Benin Royal Museum under the supervision of the traditional institution. But for reasons best known to him the Governor has gone against the understanding, given recent events.\n\nThe Oba, who addressed Palace Chiefs, Enigies (Dukes) on the repatriation of the looted Benin artefacts, the Benin monarch strongly advised that anyone, group, organisation, or government \u2013 national and international that is dealing with any organisation or artificial group in the process of returning the artefacts looted from the Benin Kingdom would be doing so at their own risk and against the will of the people of the Benin Kingdom.\n\nThe Oba of Benin\u2019s press conference was in reaction to a report yesterday by THISDAY that hinted at a possible showdown between him and the Edo State governor on the final destination of the looted artefacts.\n\nObaseki had told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nAdibe Emenyonu in Benin City",

          "text": "Bandits killed 42 farmers on Thursday evening in five communities in Faru, Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State. Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle hails from the Local government.\n\nThe affected communities are Tsauni, Gudan-Baushi, Gidan-Adamu, Wari and Gudan-Maidawa.\n\nAn indigene of the area, Malam Buba Faru, said the bandits, who rode over 100 motorcycles, stormed the communities located few kilometres on the eastern part of Faru town.\n\nBuba said the bandits shot indiscriminately at the people and burnt their houses and food stores.\n\n\u201cThey were shooting sporadically at people they came across in the five communities. They also attacked farmers who were in their farmlands cultivating their crops. So far, 42 dead bodies have been recovered by the security and volunteer groups in the area.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of the village, Ahmed Lawali, also confirmed the deadly invasion to THISDAY yesterday in a telephone interview, and said the bandits, numbering up to 70, stormed the village at about 4.30pm when most of the victims were working on their farmers.\n\nHe explained that the marauding bandits who were on reprisal mission to the village, trailed the farmers to their respective farms and started shooting sporadically, \u201cin the process, 39 persons mainly men, were massacred on the spot.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bandits raided the village following the arrest and killing of two of their members along Mafara- Faru road by the group of vigilantes popularly known as Yan\u2019sakai who nabbed them with two AK-47 riffles last Wednesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cYesterday (Thursday) at about 4:30pm bandits armed with sophisticated weapons attacked Faru Village when some of us were still working on our farms. They (bandits) killed 39 people on their farms and injured many others.\n\n\u201cThey (bandits) attacked the village because last Wednesday, Yan\u2019sakai arrested and killed two bandits along Mafara- Faru road who were nabbed with two AK-47 riffles. It was a reprisal mission.\n\n\u201dWe buried all the dead bodies this morning (Friday) according to Islamic rights after Friday prayer. We are calling on security agencies to come to our rescue so that we can return to our farms because farming is our main occupation here (in Faru).\u201d\n\nHowever, the Zamfara State Police Public Relations Officer SP. Muhammad Shehu, while confirming the incident, said 35 people lost their lives as a result of the attack by the bandits in the village.\n\nHe added that, a joint security task force comprising military, police, NSCDC had been deployed to the area \u201cand normalcy has been restored right now.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, their corpses were taken to Faru town where they were buried.\n\nShehu stated that the police could not reach the affected communities on time when they were informed of the bandits\u2019 attack due to the road network.\n\n\u201cThe police personnel tried their best to reach the affected communities on receiving the information that the bandits were there but unfortunately they could not reach the places because of the bad roads,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the \u201cpolice are currently working tirelessly\u201d to arrest the bandits.\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina",
