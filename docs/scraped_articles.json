Camillus Essien Umoh, invited them to the state secretariat for a graduation ceremony but later dismissed them promising to fix another date for the exercise as he was very new in office.\n\nMfon, who lamented that nothing has been done yet, urged the state government to fulfill its promise by giving them the start-ups so as to put what they learnt into practice adding that they are wasting away.\n\nAnother trainee, who did not want her name mentioned for fear of victimisation, regretted that despite the stress they passed through and the monies spent on transportation from her local government, Ikono, to the State Secretariat, Uyo which was their rallying point, she is yet to receive the startups from the government.\n\nShe said, \u201cthe stress was too much. We would go to the Ministry and the car they made available will convey members to different designated training centres around the local government.\n\n\u201cBy 4:00 pm they will convey you back to the secretariat where you go back to your destination. It was not easy for some people from far distance, to transport themselves to the state secretariat, some people from Ini, Ibeno really suffered because they paid their way to Uyo. the government told us that at the end of the training they will empower us, but nothing is being done.\u201d\n\nAlso, another trainee identified as Joseph disclosed that they felt abandoned by the state government noting that plans are underway to embark on a protest.\n\n\u201cUpon all the promises by the state government to us during the training, nothing has been done, no empowerment, nothing, and they will be telling us to come today, come tomorrow. We are planning a day to go out for protest because we are not happy at all,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a source in the Ministry of Trade and Investment, who also pleaded anonymity, explained that the graduation ceremony would have taken place in April but following the resignation of then-commissioner, Prince Akpabio to contest for the House of Assembly, the ceremony was stalled.\n\nHe attributed the delay to the rise in the exchange rate adding that the laptops that were supposed to be given to those in ICT were estimated at about N150, 000 each but have risen to N550,000 now adding that the state government is doing something about that.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cfrom the market survey we conducted so far, the estimated price for laptops has gone up. Another memo has been sent to the governor on the variation so that the Items can be purchased.\n\n\u201cThey should be more patient. If they are given money equivalent they may lavish the money and that may not make meaning to them. The graduation ceremony would be done at the same time.\u201d",

We cannot resolve to violence. Rather, we have maintained a firm control on our supporters not to resort to violence. We are heading to the court to ventilate our grievances.\n\n\u201cWe believe that if the party cannot listen to us, the judiciary which is the hope of the common man will.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Romanus Ugwu and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nBarely five days to the deadline for the submission of names of the party flag bearers to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), anxiety has pervaded the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the choice of running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu even as choice of a running mate for Atiku Abubakar has split the governors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nChieftains and leaders in the two parties confirmed to Daily Sun that Friday\u2019s deadline for the submission of candidates names has contributed in heightening anxiety in the ruling and opposition parties.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nIn the APC, it was gathered that emergence of Tinubu, a southern Muslim, the party has been thrown into dilemma over selection of a political figure from the dominant North East or North West with the clout to withstand threats from PDP and win votes for the ruling party.\n\nThey argued that such situation has necessitated the persistent consideration of a Muslim-Muslim ticket, adding that though it might be counterproductive to the party, Tinubu may have no choice than buy in into the situation.\n\n\u201cIt has not only really become a serious issue within our party, but has also continued to create serious anxiety. The likely options left for us out of a Muslim/Christian ticket is Plateau State governor, Simon Lalong, but apart from coming from North Central, he does not have that domineering personality to attract votes for our party.\n\n\u201cAnother option is Babachir Lawal, however, his case with the EFCC may count against him. One other person that is in consideration is Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), but does he have that electoral value? Don\u2019t forget that APC must look for a running mate that can counter and match, force for force, both Atiku and Rabiu Kwankwaso, the candidates of the PDP and NNPP in winning large chunk of North East and North West divided votes.\n\n\u201cConsultations have got to top gears but I can tell you that we are still in a dilemma. Muslim-Muslim ticket would have been the best bet for our party, but you and I know that it may not get the desired buy in from the generality of the Nigerian electorate. We are also being pressured by the INEC deadline this Friday. So, we have from now till Thursday latest to take an acceptable decision that will not hurt our party,\u201d one of the chieftains said.\n\n\u2022Wike, Okowa, others intensify lobby\n\nIn the PDP, as the special panel set up to shop for suitable running mate is set to complete its assignment tomorrow, Daily Sun gathered that governors are torn into two camps- those rooting for Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike who contested the presidential primary and came second, and those for Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that apart from Wike and Okowa, Akwa Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel, and two former governors, Chimaroke Nnamani and Emeka Ihedioha of Enugu and Imo states respectively are also soliciting support of the governors and other stakeholders to be considered for the position.\n\nMultiple sources told Daily Sun that while some of the governors believe Wike deserves to be the running mate owing to his contribution to the party, energy and ability to provide funding for campaign, others are of the view that Okowa fits the bill because of his calmness.\n\nThe former vice president has also consulted with different interest groups in the party over the choice of his running mate.\n\nGovernors pushing for Wike, it was gathered, include Seyi Makinde, Okezie Ikpeazu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Ahmadu Fintiri and Samuel Ortom of Oyo, Abia, Enugu, Adamawa and Benue states respectively.\n\nOn the flip-side are governors Aminu Tambuwal, Darius Ishaku and Godwin Obaseki of Sokoto, Taraba and Edo states who are championing Okowa\u2019s course.\n\nA party source told Daily Sun that the two camps and others interested in the slot have intensified lobby to have Atiku consider their candidate, but that Emmanuel might become a compromise candidate in the event that there is need for a middle course.\n\n\u201cThe argument is that that in terms of funding, in terms of energy, that Governor Wike can lead the charge. But the other people are saying the party needs somebody who will not give the candidate stress if the party wins the election. Udom is also in consideration. But they have narrowed it to Wike and Okowa. If there is going to a balance between the two, maybe he can come in. But you know that this is essentially about the candidate, and who he thinks he can work with,\u201d said the source.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the panel saddled with the task of shopping for a vice presidential is expected to meet tonight (Monday) to continue its deliberation.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that the panel, comprising five members of the National Working Committee ( NWC), three members of the Board of Trustees (BoT) and three governor is not going to choose a running mate for Atiku, but would only make recommendations.\n\n\u201cTheir task is to look around and nominate three persons for the candidate, alongside other critical stakeholders. The NWC will receive that report on Tuesday.\u201d\n\n\u2022Muslim-Muslim ticket won\u2019t fly, CAN warns APC\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria has restated its resolve to resist a Muslim-Muslim ticket in any pf the political parties.\n\nIts National President, Dr. Samson Ayokunle, spoke against the backdrop of report making the rounds that the APC and its candidate, Tinubu, might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, given the party\u2019s difficulty in finding a Christian from the North, who would be acceptable enough to boost the party\u2019s chances in the election.\n\nGovernor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, had recently said there was nothing wrong with the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.\n\nHowever, the CAN president at the interdenominational church service to mark the 2022 Democracy Day celebration at the National Christian Centre, Abuja, warned that such a step would be disastrous for the nation.\n\nAyokunle, represented by the President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and founder of Sword of The Spirit Ministries International, Bishop Francis Wale-Oke, said any political party that wishes to produce the next president must not undermine the Christian community.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, \u2018More than Conquerors,\u2019 Ayokunle said: \u201cWhile I congratulate the candidates, I must sound this warning, please do not fly a Muslim-Muslim ticket. It would not fly. It will not stand. Rather, it would set the nation against each other. The candidate who will emerge is the one who works with the Church. Please, do not alienate the church. If you embrace equity, fairness and justice, the Nigerian electorate will reward you with their votes at the polls and they will give you their support.\u201d\n\nReiterating his counsel on equity and fairness, the CAN president said the country cannot claim to practice justice when a certain region is deprived of producing a president.\n\nHe urged candidates for the 2023 polls to exalt righteousness in their campaigns.\n\n\u201cYou can only rule when there is a nation. In your campaigns, make sure you exalt fairness, justice and equity. If there is no righteousness, fairness and equity, we will remain divided. There is no fairness if a certain people from a certain ethnic group are reduced to second class citizens who cannot aspire to the highest office in the land.\n\n\u201cWe pray for an end to killing people in their place of worship. We pray for a nation that is united and where justice, fairness and equity reigns. God bless you all and God bless Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn attendance were the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who represented Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo; representative of the Senate President and Speaker House of Representatives, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; Deputy Chief Whip of the Federal House of Representatives; Minister of Women Affairs and former Senatorial Aspirant of the APC, Paulen Tallen; President of the Court of Appeal represented by Justice H.S Samani, Head of Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan, Permanent Secretaries of the Ministries of the Federal Capital Territory, Water Resources, Police Affairs, Civil Service Commission.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

The empowerment programme, he said, was one of the good programmes of PDP to move the people to greater heights.\n\nHe appealed to the people of Osun State to support PDP to emerge victorious during the July 16 governorship poll by supporting Ademola Adeleke\u2019s candidature, as well as in the general election in 2023. Makinde said the people would do more bad than good for the state and the nation if they failed to support PDP to win governorship poll next month, as well as House of Assembly, House of Representatives, Senate and presidential polls next year.\n\nThe people of Osun State, according to him, should not reward failure by supporting APC on July 16. He urged them to allow PDP to come back to power in the state.\n\nThe governorship candidate of PDP in Osun State for the next month\u2019s gubernatorial poll, Adeleke, who lauded Fadahunsi for the massive empowerment programme, solicited the support of Osun people for him to become governor because he has the interest of the state at heart.\n\nHe added that his family has invested so much in the state and has provided jobs for many people across various age groups. He promised more would be done for the people of Osun State as a governor. He told people to ask the people in power the investments they have made in the state.\n\nFadahunsi also expressed optimism that PDP would win the July 16 governorship poll in Osun State. He argued that the APC administration has brought a lot of untold hardship, including hunger, to people and what the people need to do to get out of the purported quagmire is to vote APC out of power and vote PDP into power.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

The communique was signed by all the governors, led by the Chairman and Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe communique reads: \u201cThe recent attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa Street, Owo, compels immediate intervention in the whole of the South West to nip the insidious phenomenon of insurgency in the bud.\n\n\u201cThe meeting, consequently, took decisions, some of which are expected to have far-reaching implications in the quest to protect lives and property in the region.\n\n\u201cThe governors condemn, in very strong terms, the horrendous crime perpetrated by terrorists against the people and residents of Owo, Ondo State, and, by extension, the peace-loving people of the South West. The governors sympathise with the victims of the mindless attack in Owo.\n\n\u201cThe governors agreed to declare a three-day mourning period, in memory of the victims of the June 5, 2022 terror attack on St Francis Catholic, Owaluwa Street, Owo, Ondo State, starting from Monday, June 13 to Wednesday, June 15, 2022, to symbolise our collective loss across all southwestern states in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that all the governors should direct the flying of Flags at half mast in all public buildings, facilities and official residences across all the states of the south west in honour of the victims of the Owo attack.\n\n\u201cThe governors noted, with great discomfiture, the increasing agitations about spaces taken over by unidentified and unknown migrants in all South West States. The meeting, therefore, recommends an increase in the scope of surveillance of the activities of these undocumented settlers by relevant security agencies in all the States.\n\n\u201cThe governors, as chief security officers, resolved to continue to assist the security agencies in the areas of crisis management and intelligence gathering at all times.\n\n\u201cThe governors reviewed reports from various states on the factors militating against peace and security in the region. They expressed grave concern on the influx of okada riders into all parts of the south west, especially the state capitals. The meeting further resolved that efforts be geared towards identity management of okada riders and stringent regulation put in place for their operation.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Forum decided it was time to reconvene the South West Security Committee, to look critically into this creeping menace before it blossoms into another intractable social problem.\n\nThe committee will be expected to submit its findings on the desirability of okada operations in the region. It is also expected to submit a multi-level template to combat the threat of insurgency and terrorism in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Forum agreed to convene, forthwith, a physical meeting of the south west governors to deliberate on the security challenges confronting the region,\u201d it added.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

One party, Action Peoples Party (APP), will not present a presidential candidate for the poll, as the time given by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for political parties to conclude their primaries elapsed on June 9.\n\n\n\nWith the emergence of the presidential candidates for the February 2023 general election, the next stage is the choice of their running mates to make up complete tickets, as provided by the constitution.\n\nWhile the politicking for vice presidential candidates goes on, we familiarise Nigerians with the men, who want to lead the country, perhaps, to help the citizens in their choice of preferred candidates.\n\nTHISDAY presents the 17 men, who seek to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nChristopher Imumolen (AP)\n\nProfessor Christopher Imumolen is the presidential candidate of Accord Party (AP).

He is the founder of Global Wealth System, a business network system, with over 450,000 membership, set up to empower entrepreneurs globally.\n\n\n\nImumolen said he joined the 2023 presidential race because he believed Nigeria needed a new kind of leadership, since things were not working because there was a leadership gap.\n\nHamza Al Mustapha (AA)\n\nMaj. Hamza Al-Mustapha was Chief Security Officer to the late Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha. Al-Mustapha was trained as a military intelligence operative and held various command posts in the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Security Group of the Directorate of Military Intelligence (SG-DMI), 82 Division; Army Headquarters; Ministry of Defence; and the Presidency. He was also involved in counter-intelligence activities and at least, two investigations of coup attempts, which brought him to the attention of Abacha.

In this, he cultivated a vast network of spies and informants across the federation.\n\nHe was removed from office and subsequently arrested after the death of Abacha in 1998. On 21 December 2010, Al-Mustapha and his co-defendants were acquitted of most of the charges against them, but they were not cleared of the alleged murder of Kudirat Abiola. On January 30, 2012, the Lagos High Court found Al-Mustapha guilty of the murder and he was sentenced to death by hanging. However, on July 12, 2013, the Court of Appeal in Lagos overturned the high court judgement and acquitted Al-Mustapha of all the murder charges.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Al-Mustapha joined partisan politics and founded the Green Party of Nigeria (GPN).

Dantalle described the suspension as being of no effect.\n\nSunday Adenuga (BP)\n\nNot much is known about Mr Sunday Adenuga, the presidential candidate of the Boot Party (BP).

He was governor of Anambra State from March 17, 2006 to November 2, 2006, before he was impeached.

          "text": "Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, George Okoh in Makurdi, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe, James Sowole in Abeokuta, Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City, Fidelis David in Akure and Oluchi Chibuzor\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo, has charged Nigerians to embrace democracy with a view to strengthening national unity and building social cohesion.\n\n\n\nOsinbajo, who spoke yesterday at the Church Service to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day, in Abuja, declared that, \u201cdemocracy works because the values of justice, equality, fairness and inclusion, which underpin democratic governance, are also at the heart of our Christian faith\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cDemocracy works, all the more so in a heterogeneous union like ours, through negotiations and compromises carried out in good faith. And each year brings us closer to a more perfect union, a more mature democracy.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, said, the commemoration provided \u201copportunity to reflect on how far we have come as a people. It invites sobriety and gratitude.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to remember the decades characterised by a lack of freedom, suspicion and uncertainty, and calls to mind the prayers, faith and courageous actions that brought us to a turning point in 1999, one accompanied by hope and promise.\u201d\n\n\n\nQuoting copiously from the Holy Bible, the vice-president recalled how in Deuteronomy Chapter 16, \u201cGod commanded the people through Moses to \u201cObserve the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIn Esther 9:20-22, following the great deliverance of the Jews from the devious plots of Haman, it says: \u2018Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far, to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd so in celebrating our Democracy Day, in-line with biblical and historical traditions, we assure ourselves that the hands of God are never too short to deliver and that His grace will always prevail for our good. Equally important, is that we also assure ourselves, that no matter how challenging the situation or moment might be, there is always enough God-given strength within us, as a people, to surmount them\u201d.\n\nOrtom Urges Nigerians to Rise against Anti-democratic Forces\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has urged Nigerians to be on the alert against anti-democratic forces, saying, \u201cWe must guard our democracy jealously.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy deliberate efforts and design, Nigerians opted for the presidential system of democracy, because it is participatory and representative enough. It is a way of life that must be held sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message to Nigerians to commemorate the June 12 struggle, Ortom recalled the tortuous journey to democratic rule and urged Nigerians to rise up to say, \u201cNever again shall we allow undemocratic forces take control of our collective destiny.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor, however, advocated the need to strengthen democratic institutions in the country \u201cso that the practice of democracy should not be at the dictates or the whims and caprices of a few individuals, who think they will lord it over the general public but the wishes of the people.\u201d\n\nYahaya Tasks Citizens on Active Participation in Electoral Process, Governance\n\nGombe State Governor, Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, has enjoined the people of the state to continue to play their role in deepening democracy by actively participating in the electoral process, which he noted has improved over the years.\n\n\n\nIn a goodwill message, to mark the June 12 Democracy Day, which was issued by the Director-General (Press Affairs), Government House, Ismaila Uba Misilli, the governor noted that democracy has come to stay in the country, and called on the people of the state to get involved and remain steadfast as major stakeholders in the process of governance.\n\n\n\nHe also noted with delight the successful conduct of party congresses and primaries, calling on the people of the state to exhibit same maturity as the 2023 electioneering begins soon.\n\nWhile urging the citizenry to take advantage of the opportunity of the continuous voters\u2019 registration, especially, those just attaining voting age or those that had not registered previously, to obtain their PVCs, he said it would make them to be eligible to exercise their rights and contribute to nation-building.\n\nDiri: Leaders Must Be Servants\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, has said the essence of democracy would be lost if leaders failed to be servants to the people.\n\nDiri made the remark yesterday while speaking at a non-denominational Democracy Day service at the King of Glory Chapel, Government House, Yenagoa.\n\n\n\nThe governor charged those occupying elective and appointive offices to see themselves as servants while the people that gave them the mandate as their masters to whom they were accountable.\n\nA press release by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as saying that elected or appointed officials should regard such positions of authority as a privilege and a platform to better the lot of the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday being Democracy Day, we should all be reminded to continue to give service to our people. If you have been elected or appointed into key government offices and positions, you should note that It is only but a privilege.\n\n\u201cIn all our actions, we should know that those who have given us the mandate to serve them are our masters and we are their servants. If you make yourselves a demi-god, you are only deceiving yourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nSoludo: Democracy is Struggle for Better Society\n\nGovernor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has described democracy as a continuous struggle for better society.\n\nSoludo, who spoke during a special mass at the Anambra Governor\u2019s Lodge in Amawbia, in celebration of Democracy Day, stated that it was not only so in Nigeria, but all over the world, as democracy was the only form of government that could guarantee a better society.\n\n\n\nSoludo said: \u201cNation building is a consequence of struggle for class, both social and otherwise, and values such as focus, determination and perseverance are indispensable in this kind of struggle. There is no perfect society anywhere in the world, however, contestations and contradictions bring out the best in the society.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as Nigeria celebrates Democracy Day, the sacrifices by the late MKO Abiola and others, in the course of the struggle that gave rise to the Democracy Day celebration will not be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe governor said for Anambra, democracy would remain a struggle to build a livable and prosperous homeland, where every one would feel safe in, noting that everybody had very fundamental role to play in bringing it to fruition.\n\nZulum: Defying Boko Haram for 13 Years Makes Northeast Hero of 23-Year Democracy\n\nPeople of the northeast, particularly, those in Borno State, have spent more than half of Nigeria\u2019s 23 years of uninterrupted democracy, showing \u201cincredible resilience\u201d against vicious attempts by Boko Haram insurgents to undermine democratic institutions, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum said yesterday.\n\n\n\nZulum, who is Chairman of the Northeast Governors\u2019 Forum, conveyed these in his Democracy Day message, made public by his spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, where he described the people of Borno State and rest of the northeast as deserving of being amongst heroes of Nigeria\u2019s 23 years of sustained democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is now 23 uninterrupted years since Nigeria returned to democratic rule back in 1999. In those 23 years, societies across the country have witnessed different levels of progress and challenges.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn those 23 years, the people of Borno State and other parts of the northeast, have since July 2009, ceaselessly resisted groups of extremely violent insurgents with the determination to wreck massive havoc on communities, pursuing the ultimate objective of bringing down democratic institutions in Nigeria, and replacing them with violent sovereign doctrines.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn these 13 years, countless number of these citizens as members of \u2018Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes, have made sacrifices including giving their lives at battle fronts, to protect fellow citizens and to preserve our nation\u2019s sovereignty and democracy. These fallen volunteers alongside those currently in front lines and all citizens of the northeast eminently qualify to be named amongst the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s 23 years of uninterrupted democracy.\u201d\n\nOwie: Those Who Annulled June 12 Election Acted in Bad Fate\n\nFormer Senate Chief Whip, Senator Roland Owie, has said members of the Military Council, that ordered the annulment of June 12, 1993 Presidential election, were under the control of evil spirit.\n\nOwie, who made the declaration in a statement yesterday, in Benin City, Edo State, stated that, \u201cThe annulment was to tell the world that those who are evil won\u2019t go unpunished. Whatever we sow, we will reap. Therefore, celebrating June 12, is the celebration of \u2018retributive justice\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeloved, whatever we do in this world we should always remember that there is God! There is Heaven!! There is Hell!!! June 12 Election was a retributive event on the wicked, for The word of God says: \u201cEvil shall slay the wicked: And they that hate the righteous shall be desolate\u201d (Ps.34.v.21).\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that June 12, 1993, was an event with which The Almighty God showed that all powers belonged to Him. \u201cThat event showed that God heard the prayers of our great leaders, amongst whom are, late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, Alhaji Adamu Ciroma, Gen. Shehu Musa Yaradua, and millions of Nigerians, who were betrayed at various times by the principal actors and their collaborators, who were to be the major beneficiaries of the success of that election of JUNE.12\u2033.\n\nAbiodun Reverses Death Sentence on Six Convicts, Frees 40 Inmates\n\nAs part of activities commemorating the 2023 Democracy Day, Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has approved the committal of six convicts on death row to life imprisonment and also released 40 inmates.\n\nThe governor made the pronouncement yesterday while speaking at the June 12 Commemorative Anniversary and Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, held at the M.K.O International Stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the committal to life imprisonment and release of the convicted inmates was in accordance with the provisions of Sections 212 (1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended) and Sections 4 and 5 of the Ogun State Advisory Council on Prerogative of Mercy (Establishment Law), Laws of Ogun State 2006.\n\n\n\nAbiodun, who called on Nigerians to draw strength from the 1993 general election and make the 2023 exercise even better, equally advocated stringent punishment for violators of due process in elections, declaring that people\u2019s ballots must count and be respected in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe governor noted that the struggles of June 12 as orchestrated by late MKO Abiola, gave birth to the seamless democracy Nigeria has enjoyed in the last 23 years, emphasising that \u201conly by upholding the tenets of democracy and ensuring its sustainability that we can truly honour the memory of those ideals that Chief MKO Abiola and others stood and died for.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu: We Must Join Hands to Build the Future We Want\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said the commemoration of another June 12 occasion must come with a deep reflection of the progress recorded so far in the nation\u2019s democratic experiment, while joining efforts to correct the imperfections yet to be addressed to make the system of government worthwhile.\n\n\n\nThe governor, in a statement to mark Democracy Day yesterday, said June 12 remained a rallying symbol around which Nigerians\u2019 aspirations for unity, hope, better condition of living and true democratic practices were built, including the hope of creating a better country.\n\nSanwo-Olu said such hopes must be rekindled by the sacrifices made by past political actors that laid down their lives, especially, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, who paid supreme price.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe challenge before all of us today, as Lagosians and Nigerians, is that June 12 must become a symbol of unity, of hope, of aspiration for a better tomorrow, one built upon true democratic ideals and practices. The Democracy Day must be a reminder of the importance of joining hands to build the future we want. Twenty-nine years ago on this day, Nigerians trooped enthusiastically to the polls, defying stereotypes of ethnicity and religion to prove to ourselves and the world that a new Nigeria is possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cRegrettably, the powers-that-be at the time truncated that dream. But it was merely a delay, not a denial. We have since been blessed with a new opportunity to build on the hope and the potential of June 12, 1993. That responsibility is now in our hands, and posterity will not forgive us if we squander it. We have seen our democracy at work. It is not perfect, but no democracy is. There are still gaps to be closed, and processes to be improved upon, but there is no doubt that the journey we started over two decades ago is fully on course and maturing.\u201d\n\n\n\nGet Your PVCs, Saraki Tells Nigerians\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has called on Nigerians across the nation to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement by his Media Office in Abuja in commemoration of Democracy Day, Saraki, acknowledged the sacrifice of Nigeria\u2019s past heroes, who have contributed to the development of the nation\u2019s democracy, and called on all Nigerians of voting age to ensure that they exercise their civic duty by voting next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs families across Nigeria settle in to commemorate the significance of #DemocracyDay, we all must remember the immeasurable sacrifice of our heroes, as well as celebrate the courage, and persistence of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThis is because, throughout this oft-imperfect journey to institutionalise stronger democratic values in all aspects of our lives, there have been hiccups, yet, Nigerians have always demonstrated an unwavering commitment to forge a better, stronger, safer, and more prosperous nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this regard, as we observe today, remembering that the 2023 general election is just around the corner, I ask all Nigerians of voting age to ensure that they have their PVCs to exercise their civic responsibility by participating in the election of our leaders at the state and federal levels.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu: Democratic Values Must be Deepened, Canvasses Restructuring\n\nOndo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has identified restructuring as the only panacea for the array of challenges confronting the nation, particularly, insecurity.\n\nThe governor, in his June 12 message yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, said it was time to deepen the democratic values that the Democracy Day represented.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough we are still mourning, we will not forget to join our voices to address the fundamental issues that have remained a clog in the wheel of the country\u2019s progress. This day represents a watershed in the history of democracy in our country. It also symbolises a total rebirth of hope and aspiration. It reinforces not just an enduring hope, but resilience in the face of daunting challenges.\n\n\u201cToday, we must make efforts to ensure that the reason for this day is not defeated. Our focus must shift primarily to the people. We must identify the challenges confronting the nation and be prepared to tackle them for the overall benefit of Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt, our country is going through hard times. The issue of insecurity requires our collective efforts. We must renew our commitment to the protection of lives and property. Our country must explore all angles aimed at securing our space against these divisive elements bent on setting the country on the path of conflagration,\u201d Akeredolu said.\n\nHouse Minority Caucus Tasks Buhari on Credible Polls in 2023\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to take very firm steps to put in place all necessary arrangements that will guarantee free, fair, credible and transparent general election in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, extolled the courage, selflessness and patriotism of Chief MKO Abiola, who made immense sacrifices and paid the supreme price for the entrenchment of democracy in the country.\n\n\n\nThey stressed that the federal government must use the occasion of the June 12 Democracy Day to commit to processes that would check electoral manipulations, guarantee the security of voters and ensure that only votes cast by Nigerians in their respective polling units counted at the end of the elections.\n\nThe lawmakers also urged leaders at all levels to uphold this legacy by carrying out their responsibilities in line with the demands of justice, equity, fairness and adherence to rules.\n\nDon\u2019t Despair, APC Will Soon Be History, PDP Urges Nigerians\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, urged Nigerians to use the occasion of the June 12 Democracy Day to reaffirm their determination to vote out the anti-democratic, inhumane, lawless and rudderless All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nThe party also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to go beyond his usual rhetoric and take practical steps to guarantee the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, reminded President Buhari that Nigerians were more than ever before, determined to fully entrench the democratic demands of credible elections, which was at the core of the Democracy Day celebration.\n\n\n\n\u201cJune 12 embodies the struggle by Nigerians against corrupt, suppressive and dictatorial forces, against lawless, insensitive, anti-people and terrorism-promoting regime, against injustice, high-handedness, recklessness and incurable impunity, all which the APC has come to represent.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unpardonable that the APC administration has arrogantly continued to violate and trample on the substance, value and quintessence of June 12 Democracy Day; the democratic principles of Constitutional Order, freedom, justice, fairness and equity as well as the much-desired national cohesion and tolerance which Chief MKO Abiola personified and died for.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe opposition party therefore called on the APC to stop testing the will of Nigerians with its continued abuse of process, violation of human rights, nepotism, electoral manipulations, stifling of freedom of speech, promotion of violence; the very pattern of the dark era of military dictatorship in our country, which Chief MKO Abiola fought against.\n\nUzodimma: June 12 Resonates Our Collective Struggle, Resilience to Enthrone Democracy\n\nImo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has congratulated Nigerians for keeping faith with democracy with June 12, noting that the day resonated the collective struggle and resilience of the people to enthrone and sustain democracy.\n\nIn his goodwill message, yesterday, he said one of the major takeaways about the Day is that the will of the people in a democracy was supreme and could not be underestimated.\n\n\n\nHe said the fact that Nigeria had experienced 23 years of uninterrupted civil rule spoke to the collective desire of the people to sustain democracy and congratulated them for the sacrifices they made to enthrone democracy.\n\nHe, however, challenged Nigerians to search their consciences whether, by their behaviour, they have truly internalised the spirit of June 12, even as he reiterated his resolve to sincerely serve the people of Imo State by providing services that would enhance their wellbeing, using his 3-R mantra of rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery.\n\nGroup Tasks Religious Leaders to Egg-on Members to Collect PVCs\n\n\n\nThe Pray Nigeria Movement (PNM), has called on religious leaders across the country to encourage their members to go and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).\n\n\n\nBut as the race to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari gathers momentum, it spoke of the need for Nigerians to seek spiritual insight as to who becomes the next President at the forthcoming general election.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Lagos, recently, PNM convener, Prophet Isaiah Wealth, said Nigerians must pray for their country always, adding that, their forthcoming June 12 Fast programme, was a vision for the movement to pray for the emergence of a good leader that would usher the country into a new dawn.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Pray Nigeria Movement is not a political organisation, and it has no political motivation or affiliation. PNM was born out of the passion to bring Nigeria to its destiny apart from political means.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* National power grid collapses again as Discos apologise\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nConsumers desperate for relief from the scourge of sky-high petrol prices won\u2019t get it soon, if the latest forecast from Goldman Sachs commodity analysts is anything to go by.\n\n\n\nIn an update to their outlook for oil prices over the next 12-18 months, the team at Goldman warned that they now expect oil prices, measured by the Brent crude international benchmark to rise to nearly $140 a barrel as early as the next few weeks.\n\n\n\nThe prediction came just as the national electricity grid in Nigeria collapsed again yesterday, even as a handful of power Distribution Companies (Discos) apologised to the customers in their various franchise areas.\n\n\n\nThe price of oil and gas has already surged more than 50 per cent so far this year, driving up the average price of goods and services and causing inflation in many parts of the world.\n\n\n\nIn Nigeria for instance, the price of cooking gas also known as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) has soared by over 100 per cent in the last one year while the prices of diesel, jet fuel and kerosene have skyrocketed, increasing by as much as 200 per cent in some cases.\n\n\n\nBut for petrol, Nigeria has continued to subsidise the product, which generally still sells for \u20a6165 per litre nationwide, although it could more than double that price without the payment of what the government terms under-recovery.\n\n\n\nThis year alone, the federal government is paying roughly 25 per cent of the entire year\u2019s budget on subsidies after it deferred its removal by about 18 months, citing its expected negative impact on the poor as the reason.\n\n\n\nDespite the growing international price of oil, Nigeria has been unable to take advantage because it\u2019s not able to produce the quota allocated to it by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\n\n\nIn addition, the country does not refine a drop of the products it consumes and therefore spends its scarce foreign exchange to import the products amid a weakening dollar/naira environment.\n\n\n\nOther countries of the world also affected negatively by the soaring fuel prices include the United States, for instance, which has now hit a record of nearly $5 a gallon as oil futures for both Brent and WTI crude were trading near $120 a barrel at the end of the week.\n\n\n\nAlthough the longest global oil supply deficit on record ended in April after nearly two years, the Goldman team said it expects a resurgence in Chinese demand will more than offset the surprising durability of Russian crude exports.\n\n\n\n\u201cOil\u2019s structural deficit therefore remains unresolved, with in fact an even tighter oil market through April than we had expected. Supply remains inelastic to higher prices,\u201d the Goldman team wrote.\n\n\n\nMajor oil producers have limited capacity to ramp production further in the near term and those that do have the spare capacity will likely be hesitant to fully use it due to a lack of exemptions from OPEC+ drilling quotas, the Goldman Sachs group said.\n\n\n\nWhile OPEC+ agreed during its June meeting to boost production, members\u2019 ability to aggressively accelerate drilling faces several challenges.\n\n\n\nOne is that drilling activity has languished at half of its level from the first quarter of 2020 for the past 18 months, and any surge in production would likely take months to implement. Another is the lack of an exemption for Russia from its OPEC+ quota at the June meeting.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Goldman team, this would suggest that the few OPEC+ members who have capacity to spare won\u2019t be allowed to compensate for the looming jump in demand from China.\n\n\n\nThe lack of sufficient spare capacity represents a binding constraint for OPEC+ members trying to pick up the slack as Europe turns away from Russian crude, a report by Market Watch stated, noting that energy stocks will continue to outperform expectations.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year, the price of Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark oil briefly hit a record $139 and has since remained above $100, a development rarely experienced in the international oil market.\n\nNational Power Grid Collapses Again as Discos Apologise\n\nMeanwhile, he national electricity grid collapsed again yesterday, even as a handful of power Discos apologised to the customers in their various franchise areas.\n\n\n\nPower distributors across the country, including the Eko, Kaduna and Abuja companies in messages sent to consumers, said they had not been able to receive bulk electricity from the national suppliers.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the latest incident was about the fourth publicly announced collapse in recent times and occurred at about 6.49pm, again throwing the nation into total darkness.\n\n\n\nThe Abuja Disco which oversees Abuja, Kogi, Nasarawa and Niger states, however appealed to its customers for understanding as it was working with stakeholders to fix the problem.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that the current power outage is due to a system failure from the national grid. The system collapsed at about 6.49 pm today 12th June, 2022, causing the outage currently being experienced.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal for your understanding as all stakeholders are working hard to restore normal supply,\u201d it stated.\n\nOn its part, Kaduna Disco also attributed the blackout to lack of supply, assuring its customers that power would be restored as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that the power outage being experienced in our franchise states is due to system collapse of the national grid.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe collapse occurred at about 18:47 pm this evening hence the loss of supply on all our outgoing feeders. Power supply shall be restored as soon as the national grid is powered back,\u201d it said.\n\nAlso, Eko Disco stated that it regretted the inconvenience to its customers, asking them to bear with the company as the issues were being sorted out.\n\n\u201cDear Esteemed Customers, we regret to inform you of the on going system collapse on the National grid. This has affected our entire network and impacted our ability to deliver optimum service.\n\n\u201cPlease bear with us as we are working with our Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) partners on a swift resolution,\u201d it stated.\n\nAlthough there was no official communication from the TCN, it was learnt that the system was yet to pick up load as at 11 pm.\n\nPower supply in the country has always been erratic in Nigeria, although it has gone worse in recent times, with hope waning as to whether the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration will be able to make any marked difference in the remaining months.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: We Must Never Forget the Sacrifices of Heroes of Nigeria\u2019s Democracy",
          "text": "For the record\n\nMuhammadu Buhari\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June the 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our nation.\n\nFrom 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\nIn 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\nOn June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\nWe must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\nFellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\nIt is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\nI am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThese primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\nI followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\nAnother positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\nAs we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\nI will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\nFor the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\nThe Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\nI know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\nTo achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\nOn this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\nFor those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\nWe have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\nOur cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\nI will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\nI am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u2022 Being an address by President Muhammadu Buhari on the occasion of the commemoration and celebration of Democracy Day 2022\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s controversial \u201cICT Practitioners Bill\u201d is closer to becoming law",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Kenya\u2019s 12th parliament passed the controversial 2020 proposal that seeks to regulate \u201canyone who employs technologies to collect, process, store or transfer information for a fee\u201d.\n\nFirst introduced in 2016 by majority leader, Aden Duale, and supported by Kenyan MP, Godfrey Osotsi, the wide-sweeping and vague ICT Practitioners Bill mandated the registration and licensing of vaguely defined \u201cICT practitioners\u201d by a council. According to the 2016 proposal, individuals who sought registration with the council needed to have completed a university education with at least 3 years of relevant experience and would pay an annual license fee. The proposal also outlined jail terms and fines for individuals who failed to comply.\n\nA snapshot of the amended 2020 bill. The full bill is here.\n\nNeedless to say, the proposal drew an outcry from the country\u2019s tech community and was reportedly withdrawn after Joseph Mucheru, Cabinet Secretary in Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Information and Computer Technology, rejected it, noting that proposals in the bill would affect innovative talent and alienate local youth from lucrative online jobs, educational and investment opportunities. At the time, Mucheru had said, \u201cIf enacted, the ICT Protection Bill 2016 will cause duplication in regulation and frustrate individual talents from realising their potential.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2016.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, a member of parliament who was nominated to represent workers, Godfrey Osotsi, reintroduced the bill with an amendment that simply loosened the eligibility requirement for ICT professionals. Now instead of being required to have graduated from a university, a proposed ICT Practitioners Council would determine who got registered.\n\nIn 2018, the bill was also rejected.\n\nAgain, 2 years later in November 2020, the bill was reintroduced with superficial amendments that removed degree requirements, jail terms, and fines for people who fail to register.\n\nAlmost 2 years later, this Wednesday in a sleepy parliamentary session, and with one day to go before the 12th parliament closed shop for the term, the bill was quietly passed and now awaits presidential assent.\n\nWho is supporting this bill?\n\nWhile the bill has generated outrage from stakeholders in Kenya\u2019s tech community, there is significant support from a raft of tech professionals. In 2016, the Secretary-General of the ICT Association of Kenya (ICTAK), Kamotho Njenga, released a statement supporting the bill. \u201cOnce enacted,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201cthe various provisions enlisted will go a long way not only to elevate the standards of ICT practice in Kenya but to also avail a blueprint that will help counter multiple challenges that accompany emergent technologies. By creating a registration framework, the bill injects professionalism and introduces a culture of accountability within the industry as the country gears towards an ICT-driven economy.\u201d\n\nPaul Macharia, a health informatics consultant supports the proposal. \u201cHaving worked in the ICT space for over 15 years, I know we needed a regulatory body like yesterday.\u201d he opined. He says the bill will ensure standards of competence, allow governments to keep a register of all the professionals that meet these standards and deal with the professionals that fall short of these standards.\n\nBoth Macharia and the ICTAK\u2019s points are the standard arguments of the proponents of the bill. But Kenya already has a Computer Misuse Act and a Cyber Crimes Act\u2014both wide-sweeping laws that regulate the use of technology in Kenya, so it is not clear how or why another law is needed to stop the so-called quacks from operating. Besides this, the bill does not disclose how the council would issue accreditation for ICT professionals or provide the criteria to be used in determining if an individual is of good moral standing.\n\nThat \u201cquack\u201d classification is also problematic. Information technology is one of the most dynamic and fast-growing spaces globally. Unlike civil engineering or medical health, for example, a software developer does not need to be certified to build software. Indeed many of today\u2019s widely used tech products are built and maintained by unlicensed developers. No country has the sort of national ICT licensing programme that this bill proposes.\n\nBut Macharia contends that Kenya can lead the way, \u201cSure! Kenya being the first is a great thing,\u201d he wrote in a LinkedIn comment. \u201cWe could set the pace/standard on how ICT professionals work.\u201d\n\nA black spot for Silicon Savannah\n\nKenya\u2019s Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 depends on strong performance from its burgeoning ICT sector. Photo by Mustafa Omar on Unsplash\n\nA loose alignment of tech stakeholders and professionals who have been fighting the bill since its debut in 2016 disagree.\n\nIn a draft counter-statement to the ICTAK\u2019s 2016 declaration seen by this writer, the group wrote, \u201cRegistering of practitioners does not necessarily lead to professionalism and accountability. ICTAK has not cited any direct evidence that registering of practitioners affects the overall quality of services provided to customers by members of a regulated profession.\u201d\n\nThe statement continues, \u201cAlmost every ICT job is conducted within the confines of \u201ccontracts\u201d that define the responsibilities of parties involved, hence ensuring accountability. What values shall this bill add to the accountability of ICT practitioners, that is beyond the scope of contracts we sign today as we go about our duties?\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d\u2026 gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem.\n\nMembers of the group also organised a petition which garnered over 14,000 votes at the time and succeeded in getting the bill withdrawn twice. But the almost comical and steady 2-year-gap-march of the bill appears to have won out\u2014at least in parliament.\n\nStakeholders now fear a presidential assent on the bill could seal what has been described as rent-seeking behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I think the bill is detrimental is that innovation is about thinking outside the box,\u201d Sheena Raikundalia, Director of UK-Kenya Tech Hub told TechCabal, \u201cit\u2019s not about your degree or paper certificates. Some of the best techies I know are self-taught! Tech moves so fast, [that] by the time you finish your degree what you learnt is outdated. This is taking a step back.\u201d\n\nAffectionately described as Africa\u2019s Silicon Savannah, Kenya is one of the Big Four technology heavyweights in Africa. As recently as last month, Microsoft and Google set up new offices in Nairobi, global card payment association, Visa announced that it had opened an innovation hub\u2014one of only 6 in the world, and Amazon announced plans to open an Amazon Web Services (AWS) local zone in the country. These are all a significant testament to the East African nation\u2019s tech reputation which also ranks 4th on the list of African countries with the most professional developers only behind Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt.\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d. But in a heating tech talent market, poorly thought out regulation that looks, to all intents, like pure gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem. Right now Kenya is distracted by its upcoming national elections, and reports of social media-fueled hate speech and misinformation are increasing. Those are important areas for regulation; deciding who is qualified to build a mobile app is not.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "On a windy Thursday evening, in April, a delegation of investors, startup founders, and journalists gathered at the Port of Dakar waiting for the Chaloupe de Gor\u00e9e, a formidable ferry that could hold as many as 340 people, to transport them to the historic Gor\u00e9e Island, where Wuri Ventures, a Dakar-based pan-African early-stage venture capital firm, was hosting its launch party.\n\nAway from the high-end restaurants and 5-star hotels\u2019 seaside bars in Dakar\u2019s city centre where most other events of this nature took place, 45-year-old Tijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Venture, had spefically chosen this Gor\u00e9e Island, which used to be the \u201cpoint of no return\u201d during the Transatlantic Slave Trade, to introduce his firm to the world.\n\nWatt towered over almost everybody else on the chaloupe in a white, Guinea-fabric shirt and black jeans. Even though his beard had nearly gone a solid grey, he was still full of energy, and his eyes were as ambitious as they probably were 21 years ago when he first moved back to Senegal.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWuri Venture is not a new establishment; it\u2019s more than 3 years old. It was first conceptualised through an early advisory business called African Tech Leaders that Watt had founded to advise startups in the process of fundraising and seeking entry into global accelerators like Y Combinator. But Watt told TechCabal that in 2018, he realised advisory alone wasn\u2019t enough to scale the ecosystem, and the idea to start investing in early-stage startups was born. He joined forces with Jerome Cretegny, a seasoned investment professional leading the Senegalese operation of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the time. The two combined their personal funds and used that to back promising African founders. In 2019, they incorporated Wuri Ventures, and within a year, the duo made 6 investments.\n\nWatt said that to realise their pan-African ambition, they needed more funds. So they sold 7.5% equity from their general partner equity, bringing 15 top tech and finance operators into the venture. They also partnered with Capria Ventures, which provided Wuri with the credit line it needed to invest, and eventually led to a $1.5 million investment in South Africa\u2019s Whereismytransport $14.5 million series A extension round before the partnership was discontinued. After that, the firm launched a subscription model so that they could pool funds from local and international individual investors\u2014angels, endowment funds, family offices, etc.\u2014using the Angellist Venture platform (It\u2019s the same platform Nigeria\u2019s Future Africa and Kenya\u2019s Mutua Venture use to power their subscription angel investing models.)\n\nA delegation of investors, startup founders, tech operators and journalists admiring and taking pictures of the historical Gor\u00e9e island as the chaloupe approaches the island.\n\nHowever in January this year, Carry1st, a mobile game publishing company Wuri Venture invested in at a very early stage and at a $4 million valuation, closed a $20 million series A extension round from a16z and Google at a valuation of $100 million. This single deal returned double of all the 6 deals they had made over the years. So Wuri exited so that it could be liquid enough to fund other deals.\n\n\u201cWe made some good returns and exited so that we can continue supporting other early stage startups,\u201d Watt told TechCabal.\n\nEven prior to the official launch in April, Wuri Ventures has advised more than 20 startups and invested $2 million across 14 deals including Carry1st, Whereismytransport, Lori Systems, Kotani Pay, Tambua Health, Norebase, Nestocoin and Caytu Robotics amongst others. The firm continues to invest alongside global investment leaders such as a16z, Google, Toyota Tshusho, Avenir Growth and others. Now, Watt believes that its subscription model is going to help ramp up their investment figure from $2 million to $4 million within a year.\n\nWuri Venture also provides incubating programs for founders to learn the ropes of the startup world. Caytu Robotics, one of such startups that incubated with Wuri, recently displayed one of its robots, an Autonomous Delivery Robot, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where it was remotely controlled from Dakar\u20146,000 km away from Boston where MIT is located.\n\nFrom Wall Street to selling sugar in Dakar\n\nWatt was born to a Senegalese father and an African American mother. He grew up in Washington, DC where he attended Sidwell Friends School, a prestigious institution that counts Chelsea Clinton and Sasha and Malia Obama among its esteemed alumni. Watt went on to study mathematics and computer science at Howard University, a historically black college.\n\nAfter a brief foray into science, running lab tests on both humans and animals, Watt spent 3 years as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in New York and London, and in 2001 he decided to move to Senegal.\n\nEven though the dotcom boom had shown signs of bursting in 2000, it didn\u2019t, and the cool kids of Wall Street were still dumping their six-figure salaries to embrace the promise of the digital revolution. Even though Watt saw his colleagues moving to companies like Priceline, he devised a plan instead to move to Africa and become a dotcom pioneer there. How difficult could that be?\n\nTijan Watt, co-founder and general partner at Wuri Ventures, stands on a makeshift podium to address the guests at the launch event.\n\nIn reality, Watt had only visited Senegal once when he was 18 and knew close to nothing about the landscape. He started to abandon one startup idea after the other: he first wanted to become an internet service provider (ISP) but the \u201cexisting player had a massive capital warchest to kill him on arrival,\u201d he giggled as he narrated this part. After spending a year playing with ideas, he started his own flavoured sugar company in 2002. The company was called Crystal, a name he claimed was inspired by a Notorious BIG song\u2014and that\u2019s how he waltzed off the track of his dotcom ambition.\n\nLike his earlier ISP idea, the Senegalese sugar industry was dominated by The Mimran Group, a French, family-owned company. The Mimran Group owns the Compagnie Sucri\u00e8re S\u00e9n\u00e9galaise (CSS) which cultivates 8,000 hectares of sugarcane in Senegal, and has more than 5,000 employees during harvest time\u2014the largest employer in Senegal after the country\u2019s government. To understand how much money this family made from sugar consumption in Senegal as far back as the 1980s, in 1981, they paid $3 million to acquire Lamborghini and saved the Italian fast car company from bankruptcy. Then they sold it to Chrysler Corporation in 1987 after expanding its model line of product from 1 to 3 in the space of 6 years.\n\n\u201cMy thought then was: since everyone in the country consumes sugar, it\u2019s essentially like a tax on the population,\u201d said Watt. \u201cAnd then that should not be held in the hands of a single person or that single family.\u201d So at 26, the ambitious Watt took on the Mimran empire.\n\nWatt would build the business into a household name employing nearly 100 people and achieving revenues of $15 million. In the grand scheme of things, that didn\u2019t harm the Mimran\u2019s dominance, but Watt believes that it created a new narrative. \u201cThere is a lot of value in Africa and it\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s the foreigners who are capturing most of it. To some extent, we changed that\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years running the company as CEO, building processes and structure, Watt left to pursue an MBA at Harvard. After that, he worked as an investment officer at Nigeria\u2019s Travant Capital in Lagos, where he stayed for 2 years before returning to Senegal to run Crystal in 2009. Seven years after, Watt finally exited Crystal and moved to Ethiopia to work as the chief revenue officer of mFino, a fintech company providing banks and telcos with mobile banking solutions in major markets in Africa including Ethiopia, Nigeria and Senegal. He stayed at mFino for a little over a year before moving to Silicon Valley in 2017 to start African Tech Leaders, an advisory firm that would morph into Wuri Venture.\n\nSacha Haider, Partner at Global Ventures, and other guests listening to Watt\u2019s speech at the launch event.\n\nThe same hunger still lingers in Watt\u2019s eyes as the ferry approaches the island, prompting guests to pull out their phones and take pictures as they make their way to the Keur Louise, a colonial house dating back to 1864, where the event would happen.\n\nAs the guests, now gathered in the beautiful stone lined courtyard of the historical house, enjoyed a variety of hors d\u2019oeuvres, an artist, sitting in a corner holding his Kora instrument dearly to his chest, blessed the scene with a calming rendition. After the meal, the guest mingled and conversed for a bit. The music stopped and Watt signalled he was making a speech from a makeshift podium. Watt told the abridged version of his entrepreneurial journey, and attempted to sell the crowd on Wuri Venture\u2019s dream, especially its subscription plan, urging them to join Wuri Ventures in building a prosperous Africa one startup at a time.\n\n\u201cWe support the concept of entrepreneurism, which is the notion that through proactive initiative, founders can create positive change in their own societies and can create their own economic opportunities,\u201d Watt said. \u201cThe subscription fund further pushes that vision by empowering individual investors.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "With less than a year to the end of the current government, an appraisal of the Nigerian economy using a mix of metrics shows that the country is worse off now than when President Muhammadu Buhari took over seven years ago.\n\nFor this reason, stakeholders have said it is not going to be business as usual for the next president as the country grapples with high inflation rate, high unemployment rate, insecurity, dwindling purchasing power of households, high cost of raw materials, and naira depreciation.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s posture from the outset was to address corruption, insecurity and improve the standard of living of Nigerians. In the last ranking by the Mo Ibrahim Index, the Nigerian economy was classified as \u201cincreasing deterioration\u201d.\n\nThe analysis of the Nigerian economy was carried out using the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2021, Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index (TI) 2021, Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance 2020 and the Human Development Index (HDI) 2020, and all point to the same conclusion.\n\nThe MPI evaluates acute multidimensional poverty, by comparing socio-economic progress being made in more than 100 developing countries. It measures the extent of deprivation individuals suffer based on 10 indicators in three equally weighted categories, including healthcare, education and the standard of living.\n\nAccording to the University of Oxford, multidimensional poverty means poor health, lack of education, inadequate living standards, disempowerment, poor quality of work, the threat of violence, and living in areas that are environmentally hazardous.\n\nWhen split further, the above three broad indicators include nutrition, child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance and cooking fuel. Others are sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, and assets. MPI values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating higher multidimensional poverty.\n\nNigeria\u2019s MPI was derived from the country\u2019s demographic and health surveys conducted between 2015 and 2020, and collated from a sample size of 90,919 individuals. And based on the assessment, Nigeria\u2019s MPI score was 0.254 in 2021. A low score such as Nigeria\u2019s indicates a very high level of multidimensional poverty. The number of poor Nigerians has been predicted to reach 95 million by the end of 2022, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe MPI further showed that Nigeria\u2019s intensity of deprivation was 54.8 percent, while 26.8 percent of Nigerians were in severe multidimensional poverty. Another set of Nigerians, 19.2 percent, were vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.\n\nOn what could have caused the high poverty intensity in the country, the report attributed 78.3 percent of Nigeria\u2019s multidimensional poverty to challenges people encountered while accessing healthcare and education as well as the declining standard of living.\n\nThe Nigerian Medical Association recently said over 9,000 medical doctors left Nigeria in search of greener pastures in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada in the last two years.\n\nInaccessible quality healthcare caused 19.2 percent of the nation\u2019s multidimensional poverty, 30.9 percent was caused by inadequate education, and 28.2 percent by the declining standard of living.\n\nTI\u2019s Corruption Perception Index put President Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption drive under close scrutiny, because Nigeria has not fared well in the ranking in the last few years. Nigeria ranked 136th in 2015, having scored 26. It was ranked 144th in 2018 with a score of 27, while in 2021, it scored 24 and was ranked 154th in the world. A score of 100 signifies that the country is very clean while zero indicates a very corrupt country.\n\nThe number of high profile corruption cases uncovered in the last few years will leave no one in doubt about the TI rankings for Nigeria. Just recently, the country\u2019s accountant-general was suspended for allegedly diverting over N100 billion; Ibrahim Magu, the former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was removed from office after he was accused of diverting recovered funds and seized assets, while the former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission was arrested over a fraud allegation running into N47 billion.\n\nThe Mo Ibrahim corroborates the aforementioned indexes. Nigeria\u2019s overall ranking in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance deteriorated between 2015 and 2019. From 48.9 in 2015 to 48.4 in 2016, it declined further to 46.7 in 2017 and 46.6 in 2018. The worst grade was in 2019 when the country got 45.5.\n\n\u201cTI rating on corruption is a perception of how corrupt a system is. With the consistent low rating of the country, Nigeria is perceived to be corrupt. It can also mean that the system that was put in place to check corrupt practices is not effective,\u201d Moses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nHe said there had been an improvement in the HDI for Nigeria over time, from 0.465 in 2005 to 0.539 in 2019.\n\n\u201cHowever, the nation is still ranked among the low human development nations. This speaks to the fact that there has been a low level of investment in soft infrastructures such as healthcare and education or there is no impact of the meagre spending on soft infrastructures,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ojo, with low life expectancy, high level of poverty, and declining purchasing power, it is expected that the HDI of the country will be low, impacting the contribution of the affected populace to the economic output.\n\nRead also: Just imagine Atiku or Tinubu as president\n\nHow Atiku, Tinubu will be different\n\nPositive sentiment trailed the quick release of the economic agendas of the leading presidential candidates, as this is expected to raise the level of engagement with the electorate and give room for the scrutiny of their programmes before the general elections in 2023.\n\nAtiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu, flagbearers of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party and the ruling All Progressives Congress unveiled their economic agendas on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMany options are available to them to revive the economy. On the monetary side, the CBN needs to control inflation and float the naira. On the fiscal side, government needs to reduce its size, resolve the insecurity, deregulate the energy and power sectors,\u201d Abiola Gbemisola, an investment analyst with FBNQuest Merchant Bank, said.\n\nBoth presidential candidates favour a market economy. This is why stakeholders believe they will depart from President Buhari\u2019s style of economic management.\n\nAnnouncing his economic agenda few days ago, Atiku anchored his programmes on three principles, which are reaffirming the critical sector of private leadership and greater private sector participation, repositioning the public sector for better service delivery, and enabling appropriate legal framework for rapid economy and social development.\n\n\u201cI will allow the market greater leverage in determining the prices; this way we shall eliminate the persistent price distortions occasioned by current interventionist exchange rate management policy. Government interventions, where absolutely necessary, will be done responsibly and judiciously,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu\u2019s economic programmes will focus on job creation, value-addition in manufacturing and the revival of infrastructures in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, if elected as the next president, he would focus on stimulating jobs, get Nigeria to work by launching a major public works programme, with significant and heavy investment being channelled into infrastructure, and value-adding manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nHe would anchor his growth plan for the economy on the establishment of sub-regional industrial hubs to exploit each zone\u2019s competitive advantage and optimise their potential for industrial growth.\n\n\u201cMy administration will build an efficient, fast-growing, and well-diversified emerging economy with a real GDP growth averaging 12 percent annually for the next four years, translating into millions of new jobs during this period,\u201d Tinubu said.",

MPI values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating higher multidimensional poverty.\n\nNigeria\u2019s MPI was derived from the country\u2019s demographic and health surveys conducted between 2015 and 2020, and collated from a sample size of 90,919 individuals. And based on the assessment, Nigeria\u2019s MPI score was 0.254 in 2021. A low score such as Nigeria\u2019s indicates a very high level of multidimensional poverty. The number of poor Nigerians has been predicted to reach 95 million by the end of 2022, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe MPI further showed that Nigeria\u2019s intensity of deprivation was 54.8 percent, while 26.8 percent of Nigerians were in severe multidimensional poverty. Another set of Nigerians, 19.2 percent, were vulnerable to multidimensional poverty.\n\nOn what could have caused the high poverty intensity in the country, the report attributed 78.3 percent of Nigeria\u2019s multidimensional poverty to challenges people encountered while accessing healthcare and education as well as the declining standard of living.\n\nThe Nigerian Medical Association recently said over 9,000 medical doctors left Nigeria in search of greener pastures in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada in the last two years.\n\nInaccessible quality healthcare caused 19.2 percent of the nation\u2019s multidimensional poverty, 30.9 percent was caused by inadequate education, and 28.2 percent by the declining standard of living.\n\nTI\u2019s Corruption Perception Index put President Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption drive under close scrutiny, because Nigeria has not fared well in the ranking in the last few years. Nigeria ranked 136th in 2015, having scored 26. It was ranked 144th in 2018 with a score of 27, while in 2021, it scored 24 and was ranked 154th in the world. A score of 100 signifies that the country is very clean while zero indicates a very corrupt country.\n\nThe number of high profile corruption cases uncovered in the last few years will leave no one in doubt about the TI rankings for Nigeria. Just recently, the country\u2019s accountant-general was suspended for allegedly diverting over N100 billion; Ibrahim Magu, the former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was removed from office after he was accused of diverting recovered funds and seized assets, while the former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission was arrested over a fraud allegation running into N47 billion.\n\nThe Mo Ibrahim corroborates the aforementioned indexes. Nigeria\u2019s overall ranking in the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance deteriorated between 2015 and 2019. From 48.9 in 2015 to 48.4 in 2016, it declined further to 46.7 in 2017 and 46.6 in 2018. The worst grade was in 2019 when the country got 45.5.\n\n\u201cTI rating on corruption is a perception of how corrupt a system is. With the consistent low rating of the country, Nigeria is perceived to be corrupt. It can also mean that the system that was put in place to check corrupt practices is not effective,\u201d Moses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nHe said there had been an improvement in the HDI for Nigeria over time, from 0.465 in 2005 to 0.539 in 2019.\n\n\u201cHowever, the nation is still ranked among the low human development nations. This speaks to the fact that there has been a low level of investment in soft infrastructures such as healthcare and education or there is no impact of the meagre spending on soft infrastructures,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Ojo, with low life expectancy, high level of poverty, and declining purchasing power, it is expected that the HDI of the country will be low, impacting the contribution of the affected populace to the economic output.\n\nRead also: Just imagine Atiku or Tinubu as president\n\nHow Atiku, Tinubu will be different\n\nPositive sentiment trailed the quick release of the economic agendas of the leading presidential candidates, as this is expected to raise the level of engagement with the electorate and give room for the scrutiny of their programmes before the general elections in 2023.\n\nAtiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu, flagbearers of the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party and the ruling All Progressives Congress unveiled their economic agendas on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMany options are available to them to revive the economy. On the monetary side, the CBN needs to control inflation and float the naira. On the fiscal side, government needs to reduce its size, resolve the insecurity, deregulate the energy and power sectors,\u201d Abiola Gbemisola, an investment analyst with FBNQuest Merchant Bank, said.\n\nBoth presidential candidates favour a market economy. This is why stakeholders believe they will depart from President Buhari\u2019s style of economic management.\n\nAnnouncing his economic agenda few days ago, Atiku anchored his programmes on three principles, which are reaffirming the critical sector of private leadership and greater private sector participation, repositioning the public sector for better service delivery, and enabling appropriate legal framework for rapid economy and social development.\n\n\u201cI will allow the market greater leverage in determining the prices; this way we shall eliminate the persistent price distortions occasioned by current interventionist exchange rate management policy. Government interventions, where absolutely necessary, will be done responsibly and judiciously,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu\u2019s economic programmes will focus on job creation, value-addition in manufacturing and the revival of infrastructures in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, if elected as the next president, he would focus on stimulating jobs, get Nigeria to work by launching a major public works programme, with significant and heavy investment being channelled into infrastructure, and value-adding manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nHe would anchor his growth plan for the economy on the establishment of sub-regional industrial hubs to exploit each zone\u2019s competitive advantage and optimise their potential for industrial growth.\n\n\u201cMy administration will build an efficient, fast-growing, and well-diversified emerging economy with a real GDP growth averaging 12 percent annually for the next four years, translating into millions of new jobs during this period,\u201d Tinubu said.",

          "title": "APC primary: Tinubu\u2019s victory, an utter humiliation for Buhari, Adamu",
          "text": "Let\u2019s face it, Professor Osinbajo\u2019s abysmal performance, with just 235 votes out of 2,340, was a repudiation of the Buhari government\u2019s so-called achievements by the APC\u2019s rank and file\n\nBola Tinubu\u2019s landslide victory in last week\u2019s presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is an unmitigated humiliation for President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu. Forget their now embarrassing volte-faces, it\u2019s an open secret that Tinubu was not their choice as the party\u2019s standard bearer in next year\u2019s election. Yet, he outmanoeuvred them and clinched the party\u2019s ticket!\n\nA few days before the primary, Tinubu had stirred the hornet\u2019s nest with an emotional speech in Abeokuta on June 3, in which he spoke derisively about Buhari. Many thought that the outburst would work against Tinubu, but, alas, it worked for him. The speech reminded APC governors, leaders and delegates of Tinubu\u2019s long-standing investment in the party, and, thus, his indispensability and entitlement as the party\u2019s presidential standard bearer.\n\nOf course, Tinubu\u2019s angry remarks were provoked by the shenanigans he suspected were going on within the party\u2019s leadership and the presidency, which he feared were designed to deny him the party\u2019s ticket for the 2023 presidency. So, out of desperation, he spoke in anger to remind the party\u2019s leadership and members of his singular role not only in forming the APC, but also in Buhari\u2019s emergence as president in 2015 after three failed attempts.\n\nDramatising his words for maximum effect, Tinubu said that Buhari ran for president \u201cthe first time, he crashed (\u201colule\u201d); the second time, he crashed; the third time, he crashed. And he wept on national television.\u201d The derogatory \u201colule\u201d comment became a viral comedy joke on social media. But Tinubu\u2019s comments merely exposed his self-interested calculations and deep sense of entitlement. He said Buhari wouldn\u2019t have been president without him. \u201cI made Buhari president,\u201d he said, before staking a bold claim: \u201cIt is my turn to be president.\u201d\n\nExpectedly, Tinubu\u2019s remarks triggered responses from the party\u2019s leadership and the presidency, fuelling speculations that there were plans to deny him the presidential ticket. Surely, the \u201colule\u201d mockery and the remark that Buhari became so despondent about being a serial loser that he wept on national television only to be consoled and helped by Tinubu were bound to offend President Buhari and his loyalists. And they did!\n\nIn a swift response, the perpetually morose-looking APC national chairman, Adamu, said Tinubu\u2019s \u201cutterances are very insulting,\u201d adding that he \u201cdoes not show any appreciable level of respect for the office of Mr. President.\u201d He rejected Tinubu\u2019s later statement that he held Buhari in high esteem and threatened that the party might sanction him for his \u201cunbecoming\u201d behaviour.\n\nThe presidency too responded, rejecting Tinubu\u2019s claim that without him Buhari wouldn\u2019t have been president. In a statement by Buhari\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, the presidency said: \u201cNo one can or should claim to have made Buhari president in 2015.\u201d\n\nMore instructively, it added: \u201cYet, as important as that moment was, it is not what should decide the next general election,\u201d suggesting that Tinubu could not rely on whatever role he played in the emergence of Buhari as president in 2015 to stake any claim to APC\u2019s ticket for the 2023 presidency.\n\nThis was the rather hostile atmosphere that Tinubu faced ahead of the APC\u2019s presidential primary. The situation was complicated by President Buhari\u2019s earlier statement to APC governors that he should be allowed to pick his successor and the later frenzied attempt by APC governors, based on Buhari\u2019s request, to find a consensus candidate.\n\nMore alarmingly, there was a sinister attempt by the APC national chairman to impose Ahmad Lawan, the Senate president, as the consensus candidate, a move rejected by APC\u2019s Northern governors and poopooed by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State as \u201can expensive joke\u201d and \u201ca flight of fancy\u201d by Adamu.\n\nYet, there were fears that Buhari and Adamu were working in cahoots, especially given Buhari\u2019s Janus-faced character. Truth is, President Buhari\u2019s insistence on inclusion of the consensus option in the new Electoral Act and his imposition of Adamu as APC\u2019s national chairman, and the enforcer of his will in the party, suggested he wanted a consensus candidate as the APC presidential flagbearer. But Tinubu wasn\u2019t going to be the consensus candidate.\n\nIn the end, however, the Tinubu force was too powerful and irrepressible. President Buhari dropped the idea of picking the APC\u2019s standard bearer and the search for a consensus candidate failed, with everyone, including some members of the APC National Working Committee, disowning Adamu\u2019s choice of Lawan as the consensus candidate.\n\nSo, eventually, there had to be an open presidential primary, with all the 23 aspirants contested. But when the chips were down, Tinubu coasted to victory. With seven aspirants stepping down for him, he secured 1,271 of the 2,340 votes cast, leaving his closest rival, Rotimi Amaechi, the former transport minister, with 316 votes, while the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, came third, with a measly 235!\n\nLet\u2019s face it, Professor Osinbajo\u2019s abysmal performance, with just 235 votes out of 2,340, was a repudiation of the Buhari government\u2019s so-called achievements by the APC\u2019s rank and file.\n\nSurely, if APC members believed the Buhari administration had done creditably well, the vice president, who has been utterly loyal to the president, would have benefited from that perception of success by securing much higher votes in the primary, even if he didn\u2019t win the contest. But Osinbajo was humiliated, a consequence of being part of a failed government!\n\nYet, Tinubu won overwhelmingly in his own right. He succeeded in securing the support of the Northern governors and delegates, undoubtedly through inducements.\n\nTinubu is arguably the wealthiest politician in APC, and probably one with the widest network, who, for years, invested heavily in party matters, with an eye on the presidency.\n\nSurely, Tinubu is not called a consummate strategist for nothing. He famously said: \u201cSeeking the presidency is my lifelong ambition.\u201d\n\nYet, he did not run for president until now, aged 70, Why? Well, he knew that his then regional parties, Action Congress (AC) and Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) were not viable routes to the presidency, and that, to become president, he must align with the North.\n\nSo, for years, he strategically bid his time, spending massively to build political structures in the South-West and political alliances in the North, culminating in the formation of the APC in 2013.\n\nRead also: Tinubu, Atiku and ASUU: Matters arising\n\nTruth be told, without Tinubu there would have been no APC, and without APC there would have been no Buhari presidency. All APC members, including the delegates who voted at last week\u2019s primary, recognise this fact, and they know too that Tinubu could have been Buhari\u2019s running mate and vice president but for the opposition to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Furthermore, they know his track record of funding parties and elections over the years.\n\nIn his autobiography \u2018My Participation,\u2019 Chief Bisi Akande, former Osun State governor, wrote: \u201cAnytime there was need for money, Atiku would say \u2018Bola, please help us,\u2019\u201d adding: \u201cBola was the only one spending the money among us.\u201d Forget about the source of Tinubu\u2019s wealth, a question for another time, the truth is that he spends it on building a political empire.\n\nBut here\u2019s the lesson: in an open primary where delegates can be induced, only the stupendously wealthy can emerge as a presidential candidate in any of Nigeria\u2019s major parties. Truth is, no aspirant without Tinubu\u2019s phenomenal wealth would have won the APC\u2019s presidential primary; the outcome was skewed in favour of the highest bidder.\n\nWhich bring us back to Buhari and Adamu: they lost out! Buhari told Channels TV in January that he had a \u201cfavourite,\u201d which wasn\u2019t Tinubu; Adamu tried to impose a consensus candidate, apparently with Buhari\u2019s knowledge.\n\nBoth tried to stop Tinubu but failed woefully. Of course, they\u2019ve both congratulated him, but they must also be licking their wounds. Humiliating!",

          "text": "On May 30, 2022, the Federal Government, through the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) signed a $3.2 billion Customs mordernisation project concession agreement with Huawei and the African Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nThe concession, which would be fully financed by AFC and has Huawei as the lead technical service provider, is aimed at modernising and providing ICT infrastructures for Customs operations.\n\nIt does not cede the core functions of the NCS to private operators, rather it seeks to modernise Customs processes and reduce evasion of duties as well as smuggling.\n\nAs businesses including port users, operators and manufacturers await the commencement of the newly signed modernisation project, there are five critical reforms that the e-Customs project is expected to introduce in ports and other aspects of Customs operations in Nigeria.\n\nComprehensive automation of Customs processes\n\nAlthough the NCS has evolved in the use of technology for several years now, not all of its operations are automated. The technological evolvement of Customs processes started with the pre-ASYCUDA era, with the introduction of ASYCUDA 1, followed by the upgrading to ASYCUDA 2.0. NCS introduced NICIS 1, after which it moved to NICIS 2, which is where it is today.\n\nThis shows that several managements of NCS have deployed user-friendly systems that are accessible by importers and agents. However, users believed that the system can only get better.\n\nTo actualise this, Customs brought in Huawei to introduce a comprehensive hardware and software technology that would further automate other Customs processes.\n\nExpected to be accessible on the web and mobile apps through the Customs website, the modernisation of Customs operations will ensure better policing of the nation\u2019s borders and help in better monitoring of import and export.\n\nIt is an end-to-end electronic flow of Customs processes, which would serve as a paradigm shift from paper or manual work processes to automated flows.\n\nRemoval of multiple alerts on cargo\n\nImporters and their agents have been complaining of multiple alerts and several other interventions on their either released or already examined containers at the port. These alerts cause delays that hinder importers from taking delivery of the consignments as and when due.\n\nThis is one of the major issues the e-Customs project is expected to resolve by creating an efficient audit mechanism.\n\nTimi Bomodi, national public relations of NCS, said with the e-Customs, cargo examinations and release of import/export goods would be subjected to live feeds across multiple platforms.\n\nThis, he said, would enable different units of Customs to know the state of every import and export being examined or released at the port.\n\nHe said it would curb arbitrary decision-making at all levels and also guide interventions.\n\n\u201cThe Service has been working with Webb Fontaine as technical partners from the ASYCUDA era to NICIS. As technical partners, all they did was manage our ICT infrastructure that focused on enhancing user interface and user experience on imports/exports. Yet, many aspects of the Customs job are still not automated. As efficient as NICIS-II is, it still has limitations, which the e-Customs would further address,\u201d he said.\n\nCreates single monitoring system for factories\n\nBeyond revenue collection from import and export goods at the port, another source of Customs revenue is taxes paid by manufacturing companies on goods produced in-country. This function of Customs is called excise operation.\n\nCurrently, the excise operation of Customs is mostly done using analogue means. This is because the infrastructure needed to automate this process is massive.\n\nBut with the e-Customs, Huawei is expected to provide the technological backbone for the automation of Customs excise operations.\n\nAccording to Bomodi, the agreement will see to the upscaling of all excise monitoring activities by bringing them up to par with what happens on the import and export side at the ports.\n\n\u201cIt will connect factories across the country and create a single monitoring system that checks daily production. It will also help to monitor taxes using more sophisticated platforms like telecom operations,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: Nigeria to earn $176bn from modernisation of Customs\u2019 operations- ICRC\n\nAutomates escort operations of Customs\n\nEscort operations of Customs for goods in transit are an example of a Customs job that is still not automated.\n\nToday, according to Bomodi, because of a shortfall in manpower, requests for escort take quite a while before approval, and this causes a serious delay in the delivery of transit containers.\n\n\u201cWith an automated e-tracking system, which the e-Customs project will provide, the delays will be things of the past. The same thing is applicable for border management and control as well as interface with other government agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, Customs is moving into an era of high efficiency, which can only be technologically enabled.\n\nIncreases Customs revenue\n\nThe e-Customs project lays emphasis on making Customs processes and procedures more efficient. Its modernisation covers all the activities of a Customs administration.\n\nIt is expected to greatly enhance trade facilitation through achieving efficient service delivery.\n\nAn efficient system will attract more users, and more users will translate to more revenue for the government and the whole industry will be better off for it.\n\nAccording to Hameed Ibrahim Ali, comptroller general of Customs, about $176 billion in revenue will be generated into the coffers of the Federal Government within 20 years through its e-Customs project.\n\nHe said that the e-Customs will quadruple Customs\u2019 current N210 billion monthly revenue collection.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu on Saturday, said the commission would soon make its stand known on calls for extension of June 30 deadline for the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).\n\nYakubu disclosed this while addressing youths in Lagos State at a Mega Musical Concert on \u2018Youth Vote Count\u2019, organised by INEC in collaboration with some partners to awaken youth consciousness toward participating in politics and governance.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the awareness campaign held at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) aim to mobilise and get youths registered in the CVR.\n\nThe exercise started on Monday with the deployment of 50 INEC Voter Enrolment Devices (IVED) to capture youths in the CVR, culminated in the concert which featured several youth-inspiring musicians, comedians and celebrities.\n\nThe campaign was organised by the electoral umpire in collaboration with the EU Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN), the Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth and Advancement (YIAGA), International Press Centre (IPC) and other partners.\n\nThe INEC chairman noted that he was aware that the youth wanted their votes to count with their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), and assured them that they would get their PVCs while their votes would also count in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that you will have your PVCs. We have new machines which will be deployed all over Lagos from next week.\n\n\u201cI know you want to hear from INEC if we are ending the registration on June 30. We have heard you loudly and clearly, You want time until all Nigerians register for PVCs: you will hear from INEC very soon on that.\n\n\u201cYou want to hear from INEC if you register and vote: will your vote count? Your votes will count,\u201d he said.\n\nNAN reports that at this point, the shout of \u201cno rigging, no rigging\u201d filled the air, chorused by teeming youths at the event, the development which disrupted a bit, the address of the INEC chairman.\n\nResponding to them, Yakubu said: \u201d We heard you loudly and clearly. I listened to you, I listened to you very clearly. Once you collect you PVCs, please go and vote. Vote and not fight.\n\n\u201cLet me assure and reassure you, your votes will count,\u201d Yakubu reiterated.\n\nAssessing the success of the Youth Vote Count campaign which started on Monday, Mr Olusegun Agbaje, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Lagos state said the commission\u2019s goal of mobilising huge number of youths for the CVR had been achieved.\n\nAgbaje, who said that about 10,000 youths were captured within the five-day exercise, said more voter enrolment machines had been deployed to the 20 local government areas of the state to bring more youths into the voting population.\n\nDecrying that many youths had waited till the 11th hour before presenting themselves for registration, Agbaje urged them to move to their various local government areas to register before the expiration of the CVR on June 30.\n\n\u201cWe are going to ensure that we capture as many of them that are eligible before the end of the exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking, the Head of the European Union (EU) delegation to Nigeria, Ms Samuella Isope described the youth turnout as a sign of hope, trust and confidence of youth in the electoral process.\n\nIsope applauded the nation\u2019s new Electoral Act as well as various technologies and innovations that INEC had introduced to make elections more transparent in Nigeria.\n\nThe envoy said that youths needed to be mobilised for electoral processes because they had power to make change happen and make a difference.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up your power. Don\u2019t allow others to be making decisions for you. Come out to register, pick up your PVCs and vote,\u201d Isopi advised.\n\nOne of the organisers, Mr Lanre Arogundade, the Executive Director, International Press Centre, said the current generation of Nigerian youths must take their destiny in their hands by getting involved in the process of choosing leaders.\n\nArogundade urged the youths to join political parties, registering and being active \u201cthis is the only way to change things in this nation. Youths have a civic duty to register and vote in 2023\u201d.\n\nAlso, Mr Samson Itodo, the Executive Director, YIAGA Africa, described as appalling, a situation where Nigerian youths with demographic majority, were not taking part in electoral processes.\n\n\u201cThe young people of Lagos state have a unique opportunity in the next election to make their number count,\u201d Itodo said.\n\nHe encouraged the youths to know that there were reforms within the electoral system that would make their votes to count.\n\nNAN reports that musicians, comedians, and social media influencers among others performed at the event to encourage the youths to get registered, collect their PVCs and vote.\n\nSome of them included: Kizz Daniel; M.I, Teni; Falz; Omawumi; Mayorkun; Waje; JeoBoy; 2Baba; Patoranking; Skiibii; Ashake, Small Doctor; Pasuma, and Bella Shmurda.\n\nOthers were Ufuoma McDermott; Chioma Akpotha; Uti Nwachukwu; Uche Jombo; Lasisi Elenu; Kie Kie; Mr Macaroni; Real Warri Pikin; Omoni Oboli; Toyin Abraham Ajeyemi and Broda Shaggi among other celebrities.\n\nThe only access card to the concert was the PVCs or the Temporary Voter Cards (TVCs).\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Olusesan Laoye\n\nOn Sunday June 12, 2022, six governorship candidates for the June 18 Ekiti governorship election appeared for a debate organised by the Channels Televisions in Ado Ado Ekiti to explain how they would run the affairs of the state if elected.\n\nThe debate was rancour free and not as rowdy as the one held during the period that Ayo Fayose and Kayode Fayemi held their debate about eight years ago.\n\nThough the men displayed what could be described a \u201cgentle man\u201d attitudes the only woman at the debate Elebute Halle exhibited the zeal of a person that meant business as she did not allow herself to be cowed by the men.\n\nShe did showed dexterity of a woman ready to govern, as she marshalled her points to the admiration of viewers, numerous party faithful and members of the public who gathered at the centre where the debate was held\n\nThe candidates handled various issues bothering on economy of the state, especially, revenue generation, how they intend to relate with the people and other matters\n\nIn his on submission the Governorship candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), Debo Ranti Ajayi (DRA), said he would create massive wealth for the state if elected.\n\nSpeaking on how it would achieve the massive wealth creation, Mr Ajayi explained that having served as a former commissioner for budget, he understands the finances of Ekiti, stressing that the knowledge will play a vital role in the transformation of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nAccording to him, Ekiti has done nothing to support the private sector. This, he says is one place to start in the creation of abundance in the state.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything possible to make our private sector vibrant and prosperous, so that tax revenue will increase.\n\n\u201cBringing in investors as an actuary, as a global person, I have the capacity and profile to attract investors to Ekiti,\u201d the ex-Commissioner for Budget & Economic Planning enunciated.\n\nHe further asserted that under his watch as governor if elected, the state will no longer use debt capital for development, rather, the state would use private equity to grow.\n\n\u201cWe are going to collaborate with our people in the diaspora who have vast resources, they will partner with government in developing the private sector,\u201d the former Commissioner for Trade buttressed.\n\nMr Ranti Ajayi went on to say that he has observed that in Ekiti State the politics of poverty thrives, a term with loosely translates to a ploy to keep the masses poor, as to ensure that they remain vulnerable and at the mercy of those in power.\n\nHe said when he becomes governor, this leadership flaw will be eradicated, adding that he plans to economically empower the people so that they can gain a voice, refuse to be manipulated and demand more accountability from their leaders.\n\nThe YPP governorship aspirant promised to train and expose the people of Ekiti State to various career options so that they can reach the full bloom of their potentials.\n\nIn his own presentation, Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate, Segun Oni pointed out that he would tackle security challenges in the state, saying he will deliver drugs with drones.\n\nOni, an ex-governor of the state, stated this during a governorship debate on Sunday in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital.\n\nHe was reacting to the June 5 deadly attack in Owo, neighbouring Ondo State where scores of people were killed at St Francis Catholic.\n\n\u201cWe will fly drones across the state for multiple purposes. We will deliver drugs with drones and those drones will be fitted with cameras so that if they are overflying any part, the security people will take a record of what they can see,\u201d he said, in his last-minute strategy to win his way to the hearts of Ekiti voters.\n\n\u201cWe must be ready to confront the security issue head-on. Multi-level security and multi-level policing, we will do it.\u201d\n\n\u2018100,000 Jobs\u2019\n\nThe ex-governor also revealed his plans to create jobs for the Ekiti people if returned as governor of the state.\n\nAccording to him, his administration will create 100,000 jobs within a year if given the four-year mandate to lead the people.\n\nWhen asked how, the ex-governor didn\u2019t really reveal the strategy he hopes to deploy. He, however, explained that his focus would be on livestock, fishery and technology.\n\n\u201cIn our first year, we must create at least 100,000 jobs. We will go into livestock and fisheries where we know there is a ready market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLivestock and fisheries can take in so much. We had a fishery programme when I was governor before and it succeeded so much. For every entrepreneur we graduate, it is a minimum of five jobs for people who will work with them.\n\nThe former Governor also explained why he dumped the PDP for the SDP because the primary was not transparent and was conducted in a manner that was undemocratic\n\nCandidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming gubernatorial election, Olabisi Kolawole, said he has no regrets being endorsed by ex-governor Ayodele\n\nHe said contrary to claims suggesting that he might be a stooge, his alliance with Fayose is based on the experience the former governor has, having led the state for eight years.\n\n\u201cIf seeking advice from experienced people makes you a stooge, then let it be,\u201d he said.\n\nKolawole further asserted that the former governor will not be in the Government House running the affairs of the State, noting that advise will be sought from past leaders and prominent Ekiti people not only limited to politicians.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe idea of being a stooge is just cheap blackmail,\u201d one that cannot hold water when it comes to a person of his caliber who has piloted the affairs of the PDP as chairman in Ekiti State.\n\nMrs Elebute Halle of the African Democratic Party (ADP) said she was prepared to goven and nothing would distract her attention from good governance.\n\nShe promised to power the youths and women.\n\nShe also said that she will not depend on the Federal allocation to improve the revenue of the state.\n\n\u201cI will encourage youth empowerment I will build good schools and encourage the education of our children.

          "title": "Turbulent flight: Nigeria Air\u2019s take-off dogged by fresh crisis",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nNigerians dream of seeing the much anticipated national carrier, Nigeria Air, take into the air may not materialise soon as the airline continues to face strong challenges that are currently threatening to scupper its take-off, Business Hallmark findings can reveal.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, it would be recalled, had during his electioneering campaigns in 2015, promised Nigerians that he would establish a national airline within three years of being elected president.\n\nWhile the initial launch date of 2018 failed to materialise, the rescheduled date of April 2022 had also come and gone, with the airline far from been ready to take into the air. The airline\u2019s management had blamed logistical factors for the delayed take off.\n\nBH checks, however, can reveal that the airline\u2019s problems are more teething and multifaceted.\n\nFor instance, more than seven years after the president gave the assurance of a befitting national carrier to expectant Nigerian voters, the airline has not been able to secure an Air Operator Certificate (AOC); a single plane has not been purchased, and it is not clear when the first flight will hit the sky.\n\nOn Monday, June 6, the interim management of the proposed national carrier was presented the Air Transport Licence (ATL) by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) at the headquarters of NCAA in Abuja. The ATL is one of the licences that must be obtained by an airline before it can start scheduled and non-scheduled services.\n\nDespite the ATL breakthrough, the airline cannot start operations without getting the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) which fully grants it the right to begin air services. Several sources in the aviation industry confided in our correspondent that the airline is finding it difficult to meet the conditions required for granting the license.\n\n\u201cWithout the AOC, the airline can\u2019t start operations, even after getting all the other licences. The Federal Government had tried to hasten the process in favour of the airline.\n\n\u201cBut since air transportation is a very sensitive and highly regulated sector, regulators are wary of succumbing to government pressure to hasten the process of granting the airline the final approval without it meeting all laid down conditions\u201d, the source stated.\n\nWhen contacted, the airline admitted that the refusal of NCAA to grant it the much needed air operator certificate had stalled the commencement of flight operations.\n\nThe interim Managing Director of the airline, Dapo Olumide, while highlighting the tedious processes involved in obtaining an AOC, however, said the airline is working round the clock to ensure that requirements to obtain the licence are met.\n\n\u201cThere is a process. There\u2019s no magic wand. There is a process to issuing an AOC. And when you have an AOC and an ATL you can commence commercial scheduled operations.\n\n\u201cThe date is largely based on the process that we are following to gain the AOC. It is not something that can be issued because they like my face, it is a process that you have to go through the five steps and you have to go through all of them.\n\n\u201cWe are working around the clock, and the team members setting up this airline are working hard for us to meet those requirements.\n\n\u201cThese are very stringent requirements, which is why the ATL that we just received took this long to be issued, because there are processes to go through. No magic wand. And we are going through the same thing with the AOC and when we have that certificate, we will commence operations\u201d, the Air Nigeria CEO stated.\n\nApart from the process of getting approval for an air operator certificate which is presently stalled, the airline is also faced with the challenge of securing aircraft needed for flight operations.\n\nSources in the nation\u2019s aviation sector told our correspondent that owing to government\u2019s overbearing influence on the airline, many partner airlines and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) are reluctant to lease or sell aircraft to the airline without securing all the necessary paperwork.\n\nRegulators and investors are said to be worried with the hurried manner the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, is pushing for the takeoff of the airline, despite the Federal Government owning only five percent stake in the company.\n\nAccording to documents seen by BH, while 49 per cent of Nigeria Air will be owned by equity partners and 46 per cent by Nigerians, the Federal Government will own just five per cent of the shares.\n\nDespite being a minority stakeholder in the project, the government had been at the forefront of driving the establishment of the airline.\n\n\u201cWhy should the government, with only five percent stake, be the one to be taking all the important decisions like the appointment of management and staff, purchase or leasing of aircraft for the company and other major decisions that majority owners, with the support of an active board should be saddled with.\n\n\u201cThis obvious overbearing influence on the airline is what has spooked stakeholders involved in the new company.\n\n\u201cI think they (investors) want more clarity and stability before committing men and resources into the new airline. They are foot dragging until they are sure of what they are getting into. That is part of the reasons that the airline has not been able to commence operations\u201d, noted a source in the aviation ministry who did not want his identity disclosed.\n\nHowever, while explaining that there are ongoing discussions with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the Nigeria Air interim boss lamented difficulties in acquiring aircraft for the airline.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to bring an aircraft out of storage and there is a further complication, as you\u2019ve seen in the media, with a lot of flights in Europe and America being cancelled or delayed.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because most people were laid off during COVID and they don\u2019t have enough staff in the airports to turn around flights. So, there\u2019s a lot of cancellations going on.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s very difficult to get aircraft. But we have discussions going on with the OEMs and we are just waiting for the terms of the agreement.\n\n\u201cWe already have the aircraft identified because that is one of the requirements for the NCAA, but we are just trying to perfect titles and so on. So that\u2019s where we are with the aircraft as its sourcing is still in process and we are looking at that\u201d, the CEO assured.\n\nConfirming Olumide\u2019s difficulty in obtaining an air operators certificate, the Director-General NCAA, Musa Nuhu, said the promoters of the airline have applied for AOC and the process is still ongoing.\n\nHe, however, refused to give assurances on when the license would be issued. According to the NCAA DG, like all other airlines that apply for AOC, there are some issues that are not completely under the purview of the NCAA such as seeking security clearance for the applicant.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition have continued to trail the presentation of an Air Transport Licence to Nigeria Air by NCAA, with aviation stakeholders describing the process as crooked.\n\nThe President, Association of Foreign Airlines and Representatives in Nigeria, Kingsley Nwokoma, argued that the government had been silent on whether or not it had gotten investors for the carrier.\n\n\u201cThe minister has been on this for a while and apparently it looks like one of the key projects he wants to achieve before leaving office. This has taken a long time.\n\n\u201cBut for me, it is important that we have investors in place because, of course, it is not the government that is to fully run the airline. We\u2019ve been told that Nigerians will also have the opportunity to invest.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not hearing much on that (investment) part of the story, we are not seeing the process. Well, perhaps, the government may assume that if it gets the licences out, that may spur investors. So, let\u2019s see how it works,\u201d Nwokoma concluded.\n\nAlso speaking, local airlines under the aegis of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) demanded that the process to float a national carrier must be transparent.\n\nThe body in a statement made available to BH, noted that though the AON is not opposed to its establishment, the idea of floating a national carrier has become obsolete all over the world.\n\n\u201cThe process is not transparent, is shrouded in secrecy and being championed by Nigerians and foreigners, unknown to Nigerians and various stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note that there is no prospectus issued for public scrutiny or investment appraisal in the process of setting up the proposed carrier.\n\n\u201cThe so-called national carrier is a private airline being promoted as a national entity using taxpayers and government resources.\n\n\u201cThere is no way an enterprise where the Federal Government is said to hold five per cent equity can be called a national carrier. Private people should not use the commonwealth of Nigeria for their private business.\n\n\u201cWe, in the AON, oppose vehemently any decision or action that is tantamount to selling the country\u2019s commonwealth to any foreign airline for free or for peanuts,\u201d the association said in a statement signed by its President, Abdulmunaf Sarina, and endorsed by 10 chairmen and chief executives of some domestic airlines.\n\nIn his own response, a former Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Roland Iyayi, said the Federal Government should not have set up Nigeria Air, calling the project a misplaced priority.\n\nThe former NAMA boss said rather than getting involved, the government should have concentrated on assisting local airlines to ensure that Nigeria\u2019s flag is carried worldwide and not necessarily about one carrier.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s role should necessarily be one of facilitating trade and business rather than being the business person.\n\n\u201cGovernment has no business being in business, except, of course, to facilitate. In America, you do not have any government-owned airline and they\u2019re all successful.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s that possible? It\u2019s possible because the environment in which they operate has been made conducive to allow their businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cSo, I would expect the government to do exactly similar things to ensure that our domestic carriers are able to survive even in the face of all of this\u201d.\n\nIyayi, who is the President/CEO of Top Brass Aviation, also claimed that the Federal Government has not been transparent enough on the national carrier project.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to have been told so many things every step of the way, but that hasn\u2019t happened. For instance, we just heard in the news recently that the national carrier has been issued an air transport license. The air transport license is actually issued by the Ministry, more or less.\n\n\u201cThough, yes, they could have circumvented the required processes as required by all the airlines to facilitate it. I did not see anywhere adverts were done by the Ministry on behalf of the national carrier to indicate that they\u2019re looking for no objection, because you\u2019re supposed to take out adverts in a newspaper over a period of time so that people can come forward with their objections and they\u2019d be reviewed.\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t happen. So, what essentially that means for me is that the government just decided by that to provide the necessary paperwork to ensure that this airline comes into being. So, obviously, the government has not been transparent enough to allow people to see what they\u2019re doing, to be able to decide whether or not it makes sense or otherwise\u201d, he said.",

They found that moderate coffee consumption, even with added sugar, appeared to be associated with a 30% reduction in risk of mortality.\n\nThe results for people who added artificial sweeteners to their coffee were less clear-cut, though this may be because relatively few participants chose to use them.\n\nIt is important to note this was an observational study that did not account for other health and lifestyle factors or changes in coffee consumption over time.

Amarachi died early Sunday morning in Osuji\u2019s house.\n\nIt was further gathered that immediately after the news got to the community, some youths burnt Osuji\u2019s house after destroying his belongings.\n\nA viral video seen by our reporters on Monday shows the rampaging youths pulling down the gate of the house said to have belonged to Osuji. There was smoke coming from the main building, indicating that the house was on fire.\n\nThe suspect Osuji had reported fled before the arrival of irate youths in the community.\n\nMeanwhile, the community has demanded justice for Amarachi Iwunze.\n\nThe Media and Publicity Secretary to Umuezeala Nsu Youth Organisation, Mr Onyenehido Nathan Maduabuchi, in a statement made available to News Direct, titled \u201cJustice For Amarachi Iwunze\u201d, said the incident took place on Sunday.\n\nAccording to Maduabuchi, the little girl was found dead by the suspect\u2019s mother after the alleged rape.\n\nIt was the woman who raised the alarm, the statement said.\n\nHe stated, \u201cLittle Amarachi Iwunze from Umuduruewuru, Umuezeala Nsu Autonomous Community in Ehime Mbano LGA of Imo State was raped to death on Sunday, 12th June 2022 by one Ifeanyi Osuji a suspected Yahoo plus boy/ritualist from Agbaghara Nsu Autonomous Community in Ehime Mbano LGA Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cThe ugly news came late hours of yesterday, when the mother of the suspect unlocked a room and found the dead body of little Amarachi lying lifeless. On raising alarm, it was discovered that Ifeanyi Osuji, her son is the suspect and the killer.\n\n\u201cWhen Ifeanyi Osuji found out that people were now aware of his ugly act, he took to his heels to an unknown destination; till this very moment, he is wanted.\n\n\u201cAll we are seeking is justice for little Amarachi.\u201d\n\nWhen News Direct contacted the Imo State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Mike Abattam on the telephone, he said, \u201cI have received calls about the incident.

For all your sacrifices, for all your effort, God will reward you this time.\u201d\n\nTinubu had while speaking in Abeokuta, Ogun State a few days before the APC presidential primary election sparked controversy when he said \u2018emi lo kan\u2019 (it\u2019s my turn).\n\n\u201cE gbe kini yi wa (Bring the Presidency),\u201d he had also said.\n\nDespite being Abiola\u2019s running mate, Kingibe betrayed the late politician and abandoned the struggle even while he was alive.\n\nAbiola had said he was persuaded by his friends and political supporters to pick him as his running mate because of his political clout in the North and closeness to Major-General Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua, who was the Deputy Head of State in the military regime of General Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nTRENDING VIDEO: 'Eyin lo kan' \u2014 Babagana Kingibe tells Tinubu he's next president pic.twitter.com/hgH9IdXRmn \u2014 TheCable (@thecableng) June 13, 2022\n\nUnfortunately, as the plot for the actualisation of the June 12 mandate thickened, Kingibe changed camp and ensured that Hope \u201893 was not just deferred but completely dashed.\n\nHe served as foreign minister under Sani Abacha, the same dictator who arrested and jailed Abiola with whom he ran on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP).\n\nAbiola would later regret choosing Kingibe over Dan Suleiman, a retired air commodore and former military governor from the then Middle Belt. Abiola referred to Suleiman as a \u2018complete gentleman\u2019.\n\nMKO said he did know that his running mate had \u201cextensive connections and relationship\u201d with the security agencies and the military high command. Kingibe contributed to the abortion of the third republic.\n\nHe was later honoured by President Muhammadu Buhari with Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON) solely because of being Abiola\u2019s running mate. An honour many Nigerians have said he does not deserve.",

          "text": "The World Bank has predicted that more people in Nigeria and its Sub-Saharan neighbours are expected to fall into extreme poverty.\n\nAccording to a report obtained via a World Bank newsletter on Friday, titled, \u201cGlobal Economic Prospects,\u201d Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and its effect on the commodity market, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have intensified the slowdown in economic growth.\n\nThe Washington-based bank further explained that the possibility of high global inflation could eventually result in tightened monetary policy in advanced countries which might lead to financial stress on emerging markets and developing economies.\n\nThe report also quoted the World Bank President, David Malpass, as saying that the world was facing the deepest global recession since World War II.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe global economy is facing high inflation and slow growth at the same time. Even if a global recession is averted, the pain of stagflation could persist for several years- unless major supply increases are set in motion.\u201d\n\nThe report added that growth in Sub -Saharan Africa is projected to slow to 3.7 per cent this year reflecting forecast downgrades of over 60 per cent of regional economies. Price pressures, partly induced by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, are sharply reducing food affordability and real incomes across the regions.\n\nIt read in part, \u201cMore people in SSA are expected to fall into extreme poverty, especially in countries reliant on imports of food, and fuel. Fiscal space is narrowing further as the government ramps up spending on subsidies, support to farmers, and in some countries, security. However, the impact of the war will vary across countries, as elevated commodity prices will help soften the damaging effects of high inflation in some large commodity exporters\u201d.\n\nAmong the risks to the forecast, prolonged disruptions to food supply across the region could significantly increase poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, while persistent inflation could ignite stagflation risks and further limit policy space to support recoveries. An elevated cost of living could increase the risk of social unrest, especially in low-income countries.\n\nOn how the global economic situation could worsen the poverty level in Nigeria, an Associate Professor of Economics at Pan Atlantic University, Dr Olalekan Aworinde, said the Russia-Ukraine war would reduce the disposable income of Nigerians, which would, in turn, affect the standard of living.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has again said Nigeria and indeed Nigerians, will not forget the sacrifices of heroes of democracy in the 1993 struggles.\n\nHe made this remark on Sunday during a statewide broadcast to mark this year\u2019s democracy day celebration.\n\nRead the full text below\n\nTHIS DEMOCRACY DAY, 2022 SPEECH IS RELEASED TO YOU STRICTLY UNDER EMBARGO UNTIL 7.30 AM, JUNE 12, 2022 AFTER THE PRESIDENT HAS READ IT. KINDLY REFRAIN FROM USE ON YOUR ONLINE PLATFORMS OR ANY PLATFORM WHATSOEVER UNTIL THE AFOREMENTIONED TIME.\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT\n\nAND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION OF DEMOCRACY DAY\n\n12TH JUNE, 2022\n\nFellow Nigerians, Today, June The 12th, marks another Democracy Day anniversary and an occasion to celebrate freedom and unity of our Nation.\n\n2. From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy.\n\n3. In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice.\n\n4. On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled.\n\n5. We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria\u2019s democracy during 1993. Their patriotism and peaceful struggle should guide our actions especially when it comes to electing our leaders and holding them accountable, now and in future.\n\n6. Fellow Nigerians this is my last Democracy Day speech as your President. By June 12th, 2023, exactly one year from today, you will already have a new President. I remain committed and determined to ensure that the new President is elected through a peaceful and transparent process.\n\n7. It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections. In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner.\n\n8. I am hopeful that we can achieve this. The signs so far are positive. Recently, all registered political parties conducted primaries to select their candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\n9. These primaries were peaceful and orderly. Those who won were magnanimous in their victories. Those who lost were gracious in defeat. And those aggrieved opted to seek judicial justice as opposed to jungle justice.\n\n10. I followed the party primaries closely from the state level to the Presidential level. I was very impressed to see across all the political parties that, most candidates ran issued based campaigns. The language and tone throughout were on the whole measured and controlled.\n\n11. Another positive that came from the 2022 party primaries was the significant increase in women and youth particularly across all parties. I was very pleased to see this development. This augurs well for the future. These trends clearly show the level of maturity our democracy has achieved in the last 23 years.\n\n12. As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a \u201cdo or die\u201d affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.\n\n13. I will therefore take this opportunity on this very special day to ask all candidates to continue running issue focused campaigns and to treat opponents with dignity. As leaders, you must all showcase high character and never forget that the world is watching us and Africa looks up to Nigeria to provide example in governance. The tone you set at the top will surely be replicated in your followers.\n\n14. For the voters, I am pleased to inform you that in the last 7 years, our government across all tiers, has made significant investments to reform and enhance our electoral laws, systems, and processes to safeguard your votes.\n\n15. The Executive, Legislature and Judiciary were and still remain united and committed to ensure these reforms are fully implemented in the 2023 general elections. Fellow Nigerians, your right to choose your government will be preserved and protected.\n\n16. I know many of us are concerned with the rise in insecurity due to terrorist activities in parts of the country. As a government, we are working hard to contain and address these challenges. And ensure that the 2023 general elections are safe and secure for all Nigerians.\n\n17. To achieve this however, we must all contribute. It is not the job of government alone. I ask all citizens to support and cooperate with our security agencies by reporting any suspicious characters and activities to law enforcement agencies. We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed.\n\n18. On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely.\n\n19. For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.\n\n20. We have reformed some of our security structures. Some of the defence assets we procured three years ago have arrived and have been deployed.\n\n21. Our cyber security and surveillance systems are being upgraded to further enhance our ability to track and trace criminal elements. We are also recruiting and training new personnel across all our security and intelligence agencies to strengthen the country\u2019s over-all security.\n\n22. I will conclude this Democracy Day speech, my last as President, by assuring you of my commitment to protect Nigeria and Nigerians from all enemies from within and outside.\n\n23. I am also promising you a free, fair and transparent electoral process. And I am pleading with all citizens to come together and work with Government to build a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\n24. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "title": "Presidential Election: Muslim Running Mates for APC, PDP will Set Nigeria on Fire, Christian Leaders Warn",
          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned political actors of the consequences of a Muslim-Muslim ticket being speculated by some of the major political parties.\n\nPresident of CAN, Rev. Dr. Samson Supo Ayokunle described such arrangement as a ticking time bomb that will set the country on fire.\n\nSimilarly, the presiding Bishop and General Superintendent of Grace of God Mission International, Bishop Paul Nwachukwu has stressed that Nigeria is a secular state, adding that a Muslim-Muslim running mates for the 2023 presidential election would be unacceptable to Christians.\n\nAyokunle issued the warning Sunday at the Inter-denominational church service marking the 2022 Democracy Day at the National Christian Centre, Abuja, where he was the guest speaker.\n\nHis speech was delivered by the founder of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries International, Bishop Francis Wale Oke.\n\nAyokunle, who lamented that the Church was being persecuted, described the speculated Muslim\u2013Muslim ticket as an existential treat for Nigerian Christians who he said would be reduced to second class citizens in their country. He vowed Nigerian Christians would resist such arrangement if it is eventually adopted by any of the political parties for the Presidential election.\n\n\u201cA Muslim-Muslim arrangement is a potential time bomb that can set this country on fire. Every part of the country has capable people that lead and occupy high political offices. Let it not be that Christians are going to be relegated to second class citizens in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThose seeking to lead us in 2023 should address this issue. A Muslim-Muslim ticket is at the heart of our existence as a nation. In fact, it is an existential threat that can blow our country apart. It is an invitation to chaos and it will not fly because it will set the country on fire. Please don\u2019t alienate the Church,\u201d Ayokunle warned.\n\nHe also said Nigerian Christians disagreed with the notion that the Church was not under any persecution in spite of the recent terrorist attack on St Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State, that left many worshippers dead and several others injured.\n\nHe said the country was on a precipice and in urgent need of courageous leadership that can avert inequalities facing it and take decisions that will galvanise it into a nation all Nigerians are proud of. He urged political aspirants in the 2023 elections to address the concerns about the hardships in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe youths are despondent and looking for the slightest opportunity to leave the country, the education is in shambles; schools closed for months \u2013this needs to be addressed decisively.\n\n\u201cOur health system is not for the people as doctors are migrating to other lands, vagabonds are filing in the gap and our people are feeling the brunt. The national debt is climbing on daily basis. And the Bible is very clear on this that the rich rules over the poor and the borrower is a servant to the lender. Our nation collectively is becoming servant to the people that are giving us money or we are borrowing from.\n\n\u201cOur debt now is in trillions of dollars. This needs to be addressed decisively by our leaders. Come to talk of insecurity. It is an inferno engulfing the whole nation. Every part of the nation is without effective response to stop it. We look around and we see so much of insecurity and this is escalating and Nigerians are restless and we are calling on our leaders to do something very decisive.\n\n\u201cI think we are tired of feeble responses and condolence that is dished out when mass killing and mindless kidnappings take place. We want something to be done. These are issues that call for\n\ndecisive leadership to take decisions that are fair and just,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lamented the fate of Leah Sharibu, abducted since 2018, for refusing to renounce her faith as well as the killing of Deborah Yakubu by a mob in Sokoto for committing an alleged blasphemy, saying the latter should not be happening to any Nigerian in the 21 st century.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo in his remarks during the church service said Nigeria was in hands of God. He assured the people that no matter how challenging the situation or moment might be, there is always enough God given strength within the people to surmount them.\n\nHis address was read by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha. He said Nigerians have always risen to the occasion even when they subjugated and lorded over by colonial powers over their resources.\n\n\u201cWe rose to the occasion, following the ravages of a civil war, to rebuild a united country, no matter how imperfect, we rose to the occasion, when you are a military dictatorships push us to the Age of Extinction and negotiated our way into a democratic democracy that provides a platform for us to build a country we can all be proud of. And we have come this far because of all of us, from the north, to the south,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\nQuoting several Biblical verses, said the democracy day set aside to commemorate Nigeria\u2019s transition from military rule to democratic governance provides an opportunity to reflect on how far Nigerians have come as a people.\n\nMuslim-Muslim Tickets Unacceptable to Christians, Bishop Warns PDP, APC\n\nIn a related development, Nwachukwu stressed that a Muslim-Muslim running mates for the 2023 presidential election would be unacceptable to Christians.\n\nNwachukwu admonished the two leading political parties that had chosen Muslims as their standard bearers to remember that choosing Muslims as their running mates would amount to neglect of Christians.\n\nDelivering his sermon yesterday titled: \u2018The battle I will like to lose,\u2019 he said: \u201cI want the political class to bear in mind that Nigeria is a secular nation, and that in choosing their running mates, another Muslim would not be tolerated.\n\n\u201cNigeria belongs to all of us, and every part of the country and religion is important. Choosing Muslims as their running mates will amount to neglecting Christians,\u201d Nwachukwu said.\n\nWhile the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) recently chose Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a northern Muslim as presidential candidate, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) settled for a southern Muslim, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nThe Bishop charged Christians all over the country to ensure they have their PVCs, saying this is not the time not to be interested about whether to participate in electoral processes or not.\n\nHe told his congregation that their only chance of participating in choosing a leader for the country was by participating in the ongoing voter registration exercise.\n\nHe also called on INEC to make the process seamless for the people, noting that the electorates were now aware and ready to participate in the processes that would lead to the enthronement of a new leader in 2023.\n\nThe Bishop blamed the resurgence of idolatry on recent barbaric killings in the country, especially the attack in Owo, Ondo State, saying it was targeted at Christianity as a religion, while urging to rise up and fight their battle spiritually.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka",

However they did not demand for any ransom.\n\nThe Union wants the Zamfara State Government to immediately dialogue with the terrorists or direct the security agencies to ensure the safe release of 30 of their members who are in the terrorists\u2019 enclave.\n\nThe 30 persons abducted last Saturday about 6pm local time along Sokoto-Gusau road were mostly youths from Zamfara State.\n\nEfforts to get the Sokoto State Police command to confirm the incident were not successful as the Police Public Relations Officer Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Sanusi Abubakar did not respond to calls or text messages sent to him.\n\nMeanwhile, suspected herdsmen yesterday killed eleven residents of Igama communty in Okpokwu local government area of Benue State.\n\nLocal residents disclosed that the attackers levelled the whole community as there was no building standing after their operation.\n\nThe people killed, according to eyewitness were all youths while the suspected herders left the children and women to escape unhurt.\n\n\u201cThe attackers are Fulani herdsmen they stormed the community in a commando manner between 4am and 6am this morning (Sunday).\n\n\u201cThey killed some of the youths in the village and spared the elderly, children and women as they allowed them to run away\u201d, the local said.\n\nConfirming the attack, the chairman of the local government, Mrs. Amina Audu said that nine corpses had so far been recovered from the scene.\n\nShe explained that though, three corpses had been brought to Okpoga, the local government headquarters, he revealed that six more were on the way.\n\n\u201cI had the report that the Fulani herders stormed Igama community between 4:00 am and 6:00am today (Sunday).\n\n\u201cAs am talking to you now, am at the police station at Okpoga, three corpses have been brought from the community and people from the area just told me that they are on their way coming with another six corpses to be taken to mortuary.\n\n\u201cThe attackers were said to have left women, children and elderly to run away but attacked and killed youths in the community. So also, they burnt down all the houses in the community,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer, SP Catherine Anene confirmed the attack but said that the command was yet to get details.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe incident is confirmed but the command is yet to receive details from officers who went to the scene.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria Too Deeply Troubled to Be Handed Over to Tinubu, Says Ex-PDP Legal Adviser",
          "text": "A former National Legal Adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mark Jacob, at the weekend took a swipe at the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, describing him as unfit to be the country\u2019s next leader.\n\nJacob who spoke when he appeared on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, maintained that given the complex nature of the country and the deterioration in all sectors, Nigeria requires a hands-on person to pilot its affairs.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nJacob expressed doubt over the official age of the APC leader, alleging that from official records in the public space, the politician is only about seven to eight years senior to his (Tinubu\u2019s) first daughter.\n\nHe remarked that rating Tinubu over the PDP\u2019s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, was a wrong calculation, stating that he only made inroads in the north during the primaries of the APC.\n\nThe ex-legal adviser maintained that when it comes to the general elections, Tinubu would not stand a chance in the north, stressing that the perception that he already has President Muhammadu\u2019s votes in the north locked-in was a myth.\n\n\u201cHe will make some little efforts. In fact, if it was Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, it is very possible that some young people, some very active people in the north would have supported him. But for Tinubu, what really does he have that can be compared to Atiku?\n\n\u201cThe campaigns are already on. Just go on social media. If you understand Hausa, what they are now saying is that we are going from father to grandfather and that is what the APC is giving us. Nobody will buy that in the Nigeria of today.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered enough in the past seven years in the hands of a baba. We cannot in all honesty, as Nigerians, hand over Nigeria to a grandfather who appears frail and has difficulty managing even his frame.\n\n\u201cThis country is too complicated to be handed over to somebody who has difficulty managing his health, his life, his person. If you manage a very big company aimed at making a profit, you will be careful who you hand over the running of the company to if you want to make profit.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a serious business concern and cannot be handed over to persons who are having challenges,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nReminded that Atiku is at least six years older than Tinubu, Jacob remarked that put on the same race track, Atiku will outrun the former Lagos governor, since according to him he\u2019s fitter in all respects.\n\n\u201cDoes he (Atiku) look older than him (Tinubu) if you put them on the race track? His current age is what he has decided to show you and some of us are aware that he\u2019s seven years older than his daughter by the information in the public domain.\n\n\u201cWhen did he marry? When did he give birth to his daughter? She\u2019s 61 and he\u2019s 69. How can we play with Nigeria like that? People must take this country seriously and people must be serious as to who will handle this very complicated country in the next few years. We can\u2019t joke with it and we cannot toy with it,\u201dhe added.\n\nNoting that the country is currently at a precipice, the lawyer explained that if Nigerians are serious, they must go beyond the mundane and look at the serious issues at stake, including the candidates\u2019 health.\n\n\u201cHow can we hand over our country to persons who can on even simple issues like age not be very forthright when it\u2019s very apparent that it\u2019s different from what you are swearing that you are in your declaration of age. It\u2019s not correct and it\u2019s not fair to the country that we just joke over these things,\u201d he declared.\n\nAway from Tinubu, Jacob said that this time , Atiku must consult widely on the issue of his running mate, noting that in 2019, the choice of Peter Obi was not applauded by most of the governors, a development that impacted the outcome of the election.\n\nHe stated that the candidate must be a result of consultations, including agreements with PDP governors, the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) as well as the Board of Trustees (BoT) members.\n\nHe expressed joy that Atiku remains a very good politician who knows the right thing to do, stressing that the choice of the running mate to Atiku will be a purely political decision.\n\nHe maintained that Obi, may also not go far because his support is allegedly coming from one zone, but admitted that the votes of the PDP may be diluted by Obi.\n\nJacob stressed that many people who initially rooted for a president of eastern Nigeria extraction are now disappointed since even the delegates from the South-east didn\u2019t vote their own during the special convention.\n\nAccording to him, nobody will stick out their neck for a cause when even Igbo people did not vote their people during the meeting.\n\nOut of the 90 votes from the South-east, he said Anyim got just about 20, adding that of the 200 in the PDP, the Igbo aspirants got just a few with many voting for Atiku.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s South-west Governors\u2019 Forum on Sunday, declared a three-day mourning period in memory of the victims of the June 5 terror attack on St Francis Catholic, Owaluwa Street, Owo, Ondo State.\n\nA communique issued after a virtual meeting of the governors stated that the mourning period would hold between Monday, June 13, and Wednesday, June 15, to symbolise the collective loss across the South-west.\n\nThe communique signed by all the governors, led by their chairman and Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), also expressed concern about the influx of commercial motorcycle (okada) riders in all parts of the South-west.\n\nThat was as churches in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State, on Sunday, recorded poor attendance during services, perhaps, for fear of another attack.\n\nThe governors\u2019 communique read, \u201cThe recent attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa Street, Owo, compels immediate intervention in the whole of the South West to nip the insidious phenomenon of insurgency in the bud.\n\n\u201cThe meeting, consequently, took decisions, some of which are expected to have far-reaching implications in the quest to protect lives and property in the region.\u201d\n\nThey condemned, in very strong terms, the crime perpetrated by the terrorists against the people and residents of Owo, and, by extension, the people of the South-west.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said, \u201cThe governors agreed to declare a 3-day mourning period in memory of the victims of the 5th June, 2022 terror attack on St Francis Catholic, Owaluwa Street, Owo, Ondo State, starting from Monday, 13th June, to Wednesday, 15th, June, 2022 to symbolise our collective loss across all South Western States in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe meeting agreed that all the governors should direct the flying of flags at half mast in all public buildings, facilitates and official residences across all the states in the South West in honour of the victims of the Owo terror attack.\n\n\u201cWe noted, with great discomfiture, the increasing agitations about spaces taken over by unidentified and unknown migrants in all South West States. The meeting, therefore, recommends an increase in the scope of surveillance of the activities of these undocumented settlers by relevant security agencies in all the states. The governors, as Chief Security Officers, resolved to continue to assist the security agencies in the areas of crisis management and intelligence gathering at all times.\n\n\u201cThe governors reviewed reports from various states on the factors militating against peace and security in the region. They expressed grave concern on the influx of Okada riders into all parts of the South West, especially, the state capitals. The meeting further resolved that efforts be geared toward identity management of Okada riders and stringent regulation put in place for their operation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governors, it is time to reconvene the South West Security Committee to look critically into the creeping menace of insurgency before it blossoms into another intractable social problem.\n\nThe communique added, \u201cThe committee will be expected to submit its findings on the desirability of Okada operations in the region. It is also expected to submit a multi-level template to combat the threat of insurgency and terrorism in the region. The forum agreed to convene forthwith a physical meeting of the South West governors to deliberate on the security challenges confronting the region.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many churches in Owo recorded low attendance during Sunday service, as fears fresh attacks by terrorists, who had attached the Catholic church, lingered.\n\nTHISDAY visited some churches, including Saint Andrews Cathedral, Imola Street, Owo; Saint Patrick Anglican Church, Ijebu-Owo; Saint Stephen Catholic Church Oke-Ogun, Owo; the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pentecost Parish, Folahan Ale street, Oke-dogbon Owo; and New Church Cathedral, Fajuyi, Owo.\n\nSt Francis Catholic Church, Owo, remained deserted and under lock and key, but armed police officers and soldiers were seen outside the church premises.\n\nAt the time of filling this report, THISDAY gathered that no priest had conducted a holy mass to cleanse the church of what had been described as a sacrilegious attack in the house of God by agents of darkness.\n\nAt St Stephen Catholic Church, Oke-ogun, members did not turn up in their usual large number, possibly for fear of attack. Also, when mass for the \u201cSolemnity of the Most Holy Trinity\u201d was going on, the entrance gate of the church was locked.\n\nA member of the church, Ejike Nwali, said it would be unchristian for him to stay away from God\u2019s house for fear of attack.\n\n\u201cWhy will I be afraid to go to church, because St Francis was attacked? To me, to live is Christ. He is my source of joy, my reason to live and to die is to gain eternity,\u201d he said.\n\nAssistant Pastor at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, His Praise Parish, Oke-ogun, Owo, Mr. Kehinde Ogunkorode, said, \u201cThe book of Isaiah 41:10, God instructs the prophet to tell His people not to fear. \u2018Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God. I will strengthen you; I will help you; I will hold on to you with my righteous right hand\u2019, so, you can see us here in our large number, we are not scared.\u201d\n\nA member of Saint Patrick Anglican Church, Ijebu-Owo, Mr Ijawoye Mathew, said the low turnout was because many people were still mourning their loved ones, who lost their lives in the horrific attack.\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, had while briefing State House correspondents last Thursday, after the National Security Council meeting in Abuja, identified ISWAP as responsible for the Owo attack.\n\nAlthough ISWAP has not claimed responsibility, the minister said security agencies, particularly, the police, had been directed to apprehend the perpetrators, adding that the attack has no ethnic-religious connection.",
