          "text": "Bandits numbering over 20, have again, reportedly kidnapped a traditional ruler in Plateau State, His Royal Highness, Aminu Derwan, after attacking his palace in Panyam, Mangu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen took away Derwan, the district head of Panyam, after scaring residents with gunshots in the early hours of Monday.\n\nA resident of Panyam community, Moses Garuba, confirmed the abduction of the monarch to The PUNCH in Jos, on Monday.\n\nGaruba said, \u201cIt was last night around midnight that the bandits, who were more than 20 and heavily armed, surrounded the district head\u2019s palace in Panyam.\n\n\u201cBecause his house was not fenced, some villagers who saw how his house was surrounded by strange people alerted other members of the community through a community bell. But immediately the bandits heard the bell, they started firing gunshots and eventually went away with the traditional ruler, leaving the community helpless.\u201d\n\nSome residents, who condemned the attack said that the incident had been reported to the police division in the locality\n\nThe spokesman for state police Command, Alabo Alfred, could not be reached when contacted on the incident as his mobile phones were switched off\n\nThe kidnap of the district head is the latest in a series of abductions targeted at traditional rulers and the clergymen in the state.\n\nOn Sunday, last week, the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the Jos East Local Government Area of the state, Reverend James Kantoma, and a traditional ruler in the state, Ugoh Ababs, were kidnapped by gunmen.\n\nWhile Kantoma, who is also the Catholic priest in charge of St. Anthony\u2019s parish in the Jos East LGA, was kidnapped at his church compound in Angware community, the traditional ruler was abducted when the gunmen attacked his palace in Amo district, Bassa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe two personalities were, however, released a few days later, after a ransom was allegedly paid to the abductors.",

          "text": "I have reported to those who sent me \u2013 Briggs\n\nBy Adesina Wahab\n\nWhether the four and a half months old strike by members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, would be called off soon now rests on the response of the Federal Government to the demands of the union made through a committee set up the the government to negotiate with it.\n\nChecks by Vanguard on Monday showed that the national leadership of ASUU has made its presentation to the Prof. Nimi Briggs-led committee set up to renegotiate the 2009 agreement signed by the two sides.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone chat with our correspondent, the National President of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, said his union had done its best in the circumstance.\n\n\u201cWe have made our presentation to the committee and there is nothing more to add,\u201d he said.\n\nOn when the feedback is expected from the government\u2019s side, he said, \u201cThey promised to get back to us within a short time.\u201d\n\nThough he did not say anything about what the union\u2019s presentation contained, it was gathered that union could give the government more time to meet some demands that have financial implications.\n\nWhen contacted, Prof. Briggs said his committee had met with ASUU and had done its assignment.\n\n\u201cWe have met and ASUU have made their presentation. Some people sent me on an errand and I have to report to them. The committee is not the final authority on this matter. We are not the ones to determine what will be done,\u201d he stated.\n\nRecall that ASUU went on a four-week warning strike on February 14 this year and has extended the strike twice.\n\nFirst, by eight weeks and secondly by 12 weeks.\n\nAmong the issues in contention are staff welfare, payment of Earned Academic Allowance, payment of Revitalisation Fund of N200 billion yearly for at least six years to provide facilities in the universities, stoppage of the Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System, IPPIS, as the payment platform in the university system among others.\n\nHowever, government is blaming paucity of funds for its inability to meet some of the demands, while the union is accusing the government of not getting its priorities right.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe ActionAid Nigeria, AAN, has called for close watch on outgoing governors\u2019 borrowings who are almost completing their second term in 2023.\n\nThe alarm was raised Deputy Chairman, Board of AAN, Mac Imoni Amarere, in Abuja, while the General Assembly of AAN addressed journalists on state of the nation.\n\nAmarere called on anti-graft agencies to closely monitor the governors and their aides in order to forestall any movement of money to accounts of their cronies.\n\nRead Also:\n\nActionAid demands inclusive education for children with disability\n\nASUU Strike: ActionAid moves to mobilize religious organizations, students\u2019 bodies, others for better university system\n\nFood Production: ActionAid tasks govt on 10% annual budgetary allocation to agriculture\n\nAdding to what Amarere said, the Country Director, AAN, Ene Obi, said, \u201cWhen Nigeria was owing in the past and they keep borrowing, what do they use the money in past?\n\n\u201cMost of our money is being used for debt servicing, borrowing for what we don\u2019t even have a say; look at the collapse of infrastructure, the roads, which our smallholder farmers, whose secretariat we host does not have roads, and the decay of infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe worse thing is that these facilities they are getting even give them moratorium, which some go for 10 years moratorium, so save yourself, and a lot of borrowing still going on, and owing a lot of workers.\u201d\n\nEne also pointed that debt profile of all tiers of government, particularly, of state and federal governments is worrisome as the World Bank indicated that due to high borrowing and debt profile, Nigeria might not have a budget again.\n\nShe lamented that the current debt profile mortgages the future of born and unborn Nigerians, which is unacceptable.\n\nMeanwhile, the Convener, AAN General Assembly, Hassana Yahaya Bello, who read the address on State of the nation, blasted Federal Government for nosediving economy, unjustifiable borrowings, hyper inflation, soaring exchange rate, high food prices, increasing cost of goods and services, folding businesses, unabating hunger and diseases, millions of Nigerians falling into poverty, rising unemployment rate, upsurge in killings, kidnappings, gender based violence, drug abuse, corruption, and other vices.\n\nBello also accused government of paying lip service to the fight against corruption and the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and its negative impact on students and economy.\n\nMeanwhile, she decried outcome of party primaries recently conducted, which she mentioned that only one female aspirant emerged governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Adamawa State.\n\nShe said, \u201cFollowing the conduct of primary elections by political parties, we note with concern the unrestricted use of huge sums of money to influence delegates to win nominations for the 2023 General Elections.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, unsuccessful aspirants are said to have asked for refunds. This ugly development casts a shadow on Nigeria\u2019s democracy. It means that the next administration is being built on a shaky foundation if nothing is done to change this narrative.\n\n\u201cThe outrageous cost of expression of interest and nomination forms by political parties for the primaries amid the debilitating poverty in the country is insensitive and condemnable.\n\n\u201cMoreso, women\u2019s exclusion remains evident in Nigeria\u2019s political landscape; only one female candidate emerged for the governorship position in the Northeast (Adamawa State) under the APC platform.\n\n\u201cThe current ASUU strike might be the longest in history if urgent steps are not taken. From 1999 when Nigeria transitioned to democracy, to 2022, university teachers have gone on nationwide strikes 16 times, covering 51 months.\n\n\u201cThe unabating insecurity in the country poses a drawback to the progress being made by Nigeria in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals.\u201d\n\nThe Assembly also had in attendance the Board Chair, AAN, Dr Jummai Umar-Ajijola; and James Milaham.\n\nUmar-Ajijolah called on the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to seize the current momentum by citizens who are trooping out to register by considering extension of the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration, CRV, by at least 60 days to give prospective voters the opportunity to exercise their franchise during the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIt is important to restore the quality of the educational system that graduated most of the politicians and exceptional working-class citizens Nigeria boasts of today and attract students from different parts of the world.\n\n\u201cTo end insecurity, the Nigerian government should decentralise the Police Force, encourage and invest in community policing, and leverage advanced ICT to combat crime and criminality.\n\n\u201cINEC should move swiftly to address the menace of bribe-for-vote or vote trading by innovating ways to monitor, detect and curb \u201cdelegate buying\u201d during political party primaries.\n\n\u201cTo end the exclusion of women in governance, ActionAid reiterates the need for the Nigerian National Assembly to substantiate its commitment to gender equality by re-presenting and re-considering, not just three (3), but all the five (5) proposed Gender Bills in the 5th Constitution Alteration Bills.\n\n\u201cNigerian women deserve a constitution that guarantees: a minimum of 111 seats for women in the national assembly; Indigeneship, citizenship, 35% in political party leadership, and more appointive positions for women.\u201d\n\nThe recommendation also demanded that, \u201cNigeria has an ailing economy sustained through unabated borrowing.\n\n\u201cRising public debt, unemployment, inflation, and high cost of living require the immediate embrace of fiscal federalism in absolute terms.\n\n\u201cThis will enable the country to break the vicious cycle of poverty. It will eliminate the wholesale dependence on oil, which makes Nigeria a monolithic economy.\n\n\u201cAdopting fiscal federalism principles will be practical approach to solving the challenges governments at all levels face today, such as the generation and equitable distribution of income, efficient and effective allocation of resources, and economic stability.\n\n\u201cRevenue drive and allocation of resources can be done effectively by states and local governments with strong measures to curtail graft and corruption.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

This would be an election which issue of how to revamp the economy would be on the front burner.\n\n\u201cThe APC Integrity Group, therefore believes that a party man like Dr. Dauda can rise to such responsibilities.\n\n\u201cDr. Dauda, an Accountant is experienced in business consulting, financial management, project management and public and corporate administration.\u201d\n\nThe Integrity Group posited that among all the aspiring running mates, only Dr. Dauda has the calmness that would benefit the APC in the campaign and in office.\n\nSome of the Aspirants of the APC Vice Presidential position are: former Governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, his successor, Prof. Babgana Zulum, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Boss Mustapha, Governor of Plateau State, Hon. Simon Lalong, former Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogora and former SGF, Engr. Babachir Lawal.\n\nAlso the name of the former APC National Youth Leader, Hon.

          "title": "Ruling on Hijab strengthens our belief in judiciary \u2014 Onike of Nasfat",
          "text": "Ishola Balogun\n\nThe Chief Missioner of Nasrul-Lahi-l-Fatih Society (NASFAT) Imam Abdul-Azeez Onike has congratulated the entire Muslim women and other ladies of faith on the well-deserved victory at the Nigerian Supreme Court.\n\nOnike said the rulling affirms their right to dress in accordance with their religious dictate, which commands them to maintain modesty and privacy from unrelated males by wearing the hijab.\n\nReacting to the judgement, Sheikh Onike said: \u201cthe Islamic dress for Muslim women is a symbol of personal space/ownership, privatisation of physical charms and bodily attraction.\n\n\u201cThe decision to wear hijab is a personal statement echoing that a woman\u2019s body is her own private business.\n\n\u201cScripturally speaking, the Almighty Allah says: \u201cO Prophet, enjoin your wives and your daughters and the believing women to draw a part of their outer coverings around them. It is likelier that they will be recognised and not molested. Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful\u201d(Q33:59)\n\n\u201cEvidently, modest dressing is a sign of virtue of all religions, as depicted by the images of our highly revered Virgin Mary, may God continue to bless her, not to mention the fact that, various professions and institutions have minimum dress code for men and women, that do not support indecency, immodesty, and nudity.\n\nAccording to Onike, the long unnecessary battle seemed like someone taking pain reliever for someone else\u2019s headache, because how do you explain someone wanting to dress modestly as required by her religion and another person challenging her on that, whereas, those who challenge women of faith for choosing to dress modestly do not see anything wrong in those who choose to dress almost naked in public all in the name of fashion thereby creating the erroneous impression that women are beauty toys, whose intellectual capability should take a back stage.\n\n\u201cSome of the takeaways from the rulings are that Muslims will always seek refuge in the state\u2019s recognised judicial platform, by going to court whenever their rights are trampled upon, as against opting for jungle, mob or vigilante justice. It has also reinforced the Muslims\u2019 belief that, the court remains the bastion of hope for Nigerian Muslims.\n\nThe NASFAT spiritual head however admonished Muslims to be magnanimous in victory and ensure that there is no form of abuse of this God\u2019s support and vindication.\n\nHe also called on the leadership of government agencies and educational institutions at all levels to respect the rights of Muslims to worship including allowing workers and students alike to observe the Friday prayers at the stipulated time.\n\n\u201cHe concluded by praying for the MSSN leadership, the team of lawyers (including the deceased lead lawyer, Chief Gani Adetola-Kaseem SAN) and the entire Islamic workers and enthusiasts who worked tirelessly for this victory, may Allah add their efforts to their scale of good deeds on the day of judgement.",
          "summary": "Ishola BalogunThe Chief Missioner of Nasrul-Lahi-l-Fatih Society (NASFAT) Imam Abdul-Azeez Onike has congratulated the entire Muslim women and other ladies of faith on the well-deserved victory at the Nigerian Supreme Court.\nOnike said the rulling affirms their right to dress in accordance with their religious dictate, which commands them to maintain modesty and privacy from unrelated males by wearing the hijab.\nReacting to the judgement, Sheikh Onike said: \u201cthe Islamic dress for Muslim women is a symbol of personal space/ownership, privatisation of physical charms and bodily attraction.\n\u201cThe decision to wear hijab is a personal statement echoing that a woman\u2019s body is her own private business.\nIt has also reinforced the Muslims\u2019 belief that, the court remains the bastion of hope for Nigerian Muslims.",

This is against the National benchmark and highly subsidized rate of N165.\u201d\n\nIt called on Mr. President to wield the big stick on the trior of Sylva, Kyari and Ahmed for a clear act of sabotage and an attempt to pitch Nigerians against him.\n\nThe youths also called on the National Assembly to urgently probe the subsidy regime and compare notes with previous years to dictate the rigged figure by both the NNPC and NMDPRA, saying that it is meant to ensure that all those concerns are punished.\n\nThe statement enjoined antigraft agencies to probe the activities of the staff of NMDPRA for possible collusion with Independent Petroleum Marketers to financially rape the federal government and Nigerians, as PMS now sells far above the national benchmark.\n\nThe statement observed, \u201cWe recognize that both Mele Kyari and Mr Farouk Ahmed are all from our region, there is no gainsaying that they have failed woefully in their responsibilities, we strongly support change in guards in their offices as they appeared to have run out of ideas on how to end the lingering energy crisis in the country.\u201d\n\nThe youths stated that if their demands are not met in the next five working days, they will organize their members from towns and villages to occupy all NNPC zonal offices and its subsidiaries across the region and the FCT until they see changes.\n\nThe youths said that their demand is not just a mere threat, saying that they would follow up with full action after the expiration of the ultimatum and will serve as a litmus test on the part of the government in their fight against corruption and indiscipline.\n\nThe youths noted that one of the consequences of inadequate supply of the petroleum products in the region is the renewed killings by terrorists as security agencies are equally struggling to access the product in most rural communities that are soft targets for criminal elements, regretting that security personnel are largely immobilized to respond to distress calls.",

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu was at the forefront of the battle for the coveted Presidential primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the revered National Leader of the party.\n\nSanwo-Olu proved himself a worthy prodigy of the Lion of Bourdillon and the strong man of Lagos politics. He totally sold himself out for the lifelong ambition of his political benefactor and mentor. It was a selfless agenda in the national interest for Sanwo-Olu. Many who thought he was junketing Abuja and Lagos meeting power brokers in the ruling party for the sake of Asiwaju were surprised when the zeal of the performing governor did not wane even when rumour mills were agog that he won\u2019t get a second term ticket.\n\nHe was unperturbed. He fired on. Like a Boy Scout, he was ever ready for the Tinubu Presidential ambition. Sanwo-Olu, who had worked with Asiwaju Tinubu as a member of the executive council before he became governor knows the leadership and administrative capacity of Jagagban Borgu.\n\nIn a state of near ruins and utter darkness that currently envelopes the nation, Sanwo-Olu knows that Tinubu has the courage, vision and capability to rescue the nation from the cliff.He was a living witness to what Lagos looked like after the years of plundering of jackboot military junta. Lagos, a former Federal capital which was also the theatre of action of pro-democracy and political struggles bore the brunt of the military dictatorship.\n\nPublic infrastructure was in comatose. Schools, waste management, public hospitals and other public services were in a sorry state. Tinubu came with a clear vision of rescuing Lagos and positioning the state on the path of continuous growth trajectory. Difficult decisions were taken for the Development Master Plan Blueprint envisioned by Asiwaju Tinubu to fly.\n\nPublic finance and taxation systems and processes were restructured in line with global best practice. Without unnecessarily adding to the burden of Lagosians who had been badly dealt with by military guys, the state revenues were ramp up, human involvements with cash reduced, wastage plugged and funds were freed up for unprecedented, monumental development.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu as one of the students in the Asiwaju Leadership School saw all these mind blowing feats and how the man creatively swell the Internal Revenue Generation(IGR) from paltry N600 Million to billions of Naira before leaving government in 2007.\n\nThis rare capacity to inspire and lead people to greatness are the greatest attributes that make Asiwaju Tinubu exceptional. So, these among others are the driving forces behind the quest for Asiwaju Tinubu presidency which Governor Sanwo-Olu among other close associates of the Lion of Boudillon had been championing.\n\nWhen the prized ticket appeared like a tall order, In February 2022, Governor Sanwo-Olu had rally political weights in Lagos and beyond who had benefited from the benevolence and large heartedness of Tinubu. He declared in unequivocally that it was a time for payback:\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cLet me stress the importance of working together as one family, especially as we approach 2023, which is an all-important election year. There is a whole lot we can achieve together as a united bloc. I enjoin all of us to come together and rally round our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as he gives the nation\u2019s presidency a shot.\n\n\u201cHe has given himself to the good people of Lagos, and now he wants to replicate his progressive ideas at the national level. It is time to pay him back with our unwavering support. He is, no doubt, the right and best man for the job. He knows the issues plaguing our nation like the back of his hands and he has the magic wand to fix it.\u201d\n\nThat was months before Tinubu spilled the beans in Abeokuta, Ogun State capital. The then Presidential aspirant now candidate spoke of his sacrifices for his proteges to rise in sub and national politics. It was tedious service spanning over 25 years according to him.\n\nFor the first time, he counted revisionism on how the serving Vice President of Nigeria, Prof Yemi Osinbajo emerged as the running mate to General Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. He disclosed that he surrendered his Vice President slot for the overall interest of the party, Yoruba land in particular and Nigeria in general.\n\nIt was my turn, Asiwaju roared in the ancient city of Abeokuta. Sanwo-Olu, who was a leading campaigner for the APC presidential ticket for Tinubu, was in Abeokuta the same day. They had earlier visited Ibadan, Oyo State capital.\n\nAs the D-Day drew near, Sanwo-Olu was in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja to perfect the game plan for Asiwaju Tinubu. He stood till the very end until victory was delivered.\n\nSanwo-Olu was the eyes of Tinubu among the governors elected on the platform of the APC. The commitment and pledged support to the Tinubu candidacy must be kept under close watch. Sanwo-Olu ensured that the agreement remained sacrosanct. They believe the governor because of his antecedence. He keeps to agreements.\n\nSanwo-Olu didn\u2019t jet out after the declaration of the well-deserved victory of Tinubu on Wednesday. He stayed back in Abuja to receive well meaning Nigerians who thronged Asokoro residence of Tinubu who had come to felicitate with him and pledge support for his candidacy.\n\nThe governor was also on the entourage to pay thank you visits to co-presidential contestants and leaders of the party including President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Osinbajo.\n\nSo, when APC members and Excos members in the Lagos State Cabinet stormed Lagos Airport, it was understandable. He was a hero who deserved a heroic welcome.\n\nTrust Sanwo-Olu, he is not resting until Asiwaju is crowned the President, Commander In Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. The real task is here. Selling Asiwaju across ethnic, religious divides and mobilising votes that will deliver the presidency to him.\n\nTrust, Sanwo-Olu will lead from the front as he did in the keenly struggle for the APC Presidential ticket.",

          "title": "No 40% telecom tariff hike now, says NCC The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has said the proposal of telecom operators for a 40 per cent end user tariff on services is not realistic this year.\n\nThe operators, acting under the aegis of the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), in a letter to the NCC, had proposed a 40 per cent increase in the cost of calls, short messages service (SMS) and data as a result of the rising cost of running a business.\n\nBased on their proposal, the price floor of calls will increase from N6.4 to N8.95 while the price cap of SMS will increase from N4 to N5.61.\n\nThis was shown in a letter entitled: \u2018Impact of the economic and security issues on the telecommunications sector\u2019.\n\nConsistent with Section 108 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 (NCA 2003), the NCC is responsible for the approval of tariffs and other charges for the provision of service by licensed telecoms service providers.\n\nhe Chief Executive Officer, NCC, Prof Garba Umar Danbatta, who said the Commission was in receipt of the request explained that no action would be carried out on it this year because funds are not available to undertake cost-based study, which will determine the suitability or otherwise of any hike in tariff.\n\n\u201cThe proposal is under consideration by the Commission and there is a need to do a cost-based study on the market segments. There is, however, no provision for doing this in the 2022 budget,\u201d Danbatta wrote in an e-mail.\n\nThe request had been rejected by stakeholders in the industry except the operators.\n\nIn the letter, the telecom companies had said there had been a 40 per cent increase in the cost of doing business.\n\nAccording to them, the telecom industry has been financially impacted by the recession of 2020 and the effect of the ongoing Ukraine/Russia crisis which had resulted in an increase in energy costs, increasing their operating expenses by 35 per cent.\n\nThey added that the recent introduction of excise duty of five per cent on telecom services had further increased the burden of multiple taxes and levies on the industry.\n\n\u201cAs the Commission may be aware, the power sector under the supervision of its Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission of the power sector in November 2020 undertook a review of electricity tariffs to cater for the economic headwinds reported above,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, ALTON considers it expedient for the telecommunications sector to undergo periodic cost adjustments through the commission\u2019s intervention in order to minimise the impact of the challenging economic issues faced by our members. Details are hereunder:\n\n\u201cUpward review of the price determination for voice and data and SMS. Given the state of the economy and the circa 40 per cent increase in the cost of doing business, we wish to request for an interim administrative review of the mobile (voice) termination rate for voice; administrative data floor price, and cost of SMS as reflected in extant instruments.\n\n\u201cWith respect to voice and SMS cost, ALTON respectfully requests the commission to consider a mark-up approach to address the upward price adjustment desirable for the industry. We have enclosed herein and marked \u2018Annexure 1\u2019our proposal in that regard.\n\n\u201cFor data services, we wish to request that the commission implements the recommendations in the August 2020 KPMG report on the determination of cost-based pricing for wholesale and retail broadband service in Nigeria. Excerpts from the report are attached and marked \u2018Annexure 2\u2019 to provide a further illustration.\n\n\u201cIn implementing the said recommendations, however, we recommend that the 40 per cent increase in the cost of doing business be factored in to arrive at a cost price per GB in view of the current economic situation.\u201d\n\nALTON added that to further help the operators during this economic crisis, the Commission should explore and provide other means of punishing operators rather than punitive monetary sanctions; extend the payment timeline of relevant regulatory levies and fees; prevail on the Federal Government to sign the executive order declaring telecoms infrastructure as a critical national infrastructure to mitigate cost spent replacing damaged and stolen infrastructures, among other things.\n\nIn annexure one section of the letter, the body requested an upward adjustment of the MTR by 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor large operators, new interim MTR of N5.46 from N3.90 reflecting 40 per cent increase in the cost of business.\n\n\u201cFor small operators, new interim MTR of N6.58 from N4.70 reflecting 40 per cent increase in the cost of business,\u201d the operators had stated.",

          "text": "The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has suspended the issuance of licences to applicants on the free trade zones at the airports until conflicts in the regulatory framework between it and the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) are resolved.\n\nThis is as stakeholders have decried the multiple regulations between FAAN and NEPZA, saying it is one of the major factors slowing the growth of free trade zones.\n\nManaging Director, FAAN, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu, who gave the suspension notice to intending free trade zone applicants, said at the Lagos Airport alone, there are two free trade zone operators, while additional two companies have applied.\n\nHe explained that the five international airports in the country have been designated as free trade zones and warned that if not well-regulated, it might be a big challenge for the country in the future.\n\nHowever, the General Manager, Vicven Integrated Services and one of the panelists at the first Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) National Aviation Conferences (FNAC) Mr. Obinna Emeazo, said there was the need for policy harmonisation by government agencies \u2013 FAAN and NEPZA \u2013 to ensure smooth growth.\n\nEmeazo, who spoke as a panellist on the topic: \u2018Special Economic Zones at the airports and trade facilitation: Growing revenue and the national GDP,\u2019 identified infrastructure and inconsistent government policies in the Free Trade Zones as factors which led the death of Tinapa Resort in Cross River State.\n\nHe said the rot in Tinapa was due to government policy somersaults and lack of infrastructure.\n\nAccording to him, Tinapa was designed to flourish with the approval of $5,000 worth of goods for local consumers, but was later brought down to $330, thereby discouraging investors.\n\nEmeazo decried that the change in policy by the government had negatively impacted on the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), especially in exports.\n\nHe said: \u201cTinapa Resort started well and so many investors were attracted by the benefits, but along the line, it was brought down to $330, which led to the dwindling of the growth of the resort.\n\n\u201cEveryone, especially tourists, go to Tinapa to shop and enjoy their holidays. So, it is an inconsistency on the part of the government.You brought out policies that attracted investors and in mid-way, you changed such policies. If they have to focus on the special economic zones, we have to make it right. NEPZA must stand its feet and make it strong. The regulations must be strong.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot manufacture, you cannot export. How much are you able to attract? When was the last time you heard about Tinapa? It is still at the elementary stage and one would have expected that it would have gone beyond that.\u201d\n\nOn the multiple regulations between FAAN and NEPZA slowing down the growth of free trade zones in the country, he stressed that both agencies had to harmonise their policies for the progress of the country.\n\n\u201cNEPZA has to show strong leadership and must be able to show strong collaboration with other agencies. You have the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), which is tax; there is still an argument on the tax investors enjoy. Some states still come to tell the investors to pay tax. They should be able to bring all the states together.\n\n\u201cIn their board of directors, you see all the government agencies like customs, finance ministry, FIRS and others, yet you do not see a strong stakeholder like FAAN. At the level of implementation, FAAN will tell you it is against its own approval,\u201d he said.\n\nThe FAAN MD had also insisted that FAAN and other relevant authorities like the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) should be represented in the board of NEPZA to be able to address the challenges in the system.",

The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission and law enforcement agencies for the preparations put in place for the smooth conduct of the poll, urging them to keep the momentum in other upcoming elections.\n\n\u2022Orji Kalu: Victory timely, well-deserved\n\nChief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Kalu, in a message issued in Abuja, wished Oyebanji a successful tenure in office, while urging him to adopt a participatory leadership style.\n\nWhile commending the people of Ekiti for voting the candidate of the APC, Kalu urged Oyebanji to consolidate on the achievements of Governor Fayemi. According to him, the APC would continue to wax strong.\n\n\u201cThe victory of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Biodun Oyebanji is timely and well deserved. The Fayemi-led state government has transformed Ekiti in all ramifications and as such, the people of Ekiti compensated the APC for the good works of the current administration in the state.\n\n\u201cThe governor-elect having served in various capacities at the state level has the administrative acumen and political dexterity to build on the accomplishments of the current administration. The people of Ekiti have reaffirmed their support for the APC with their votes.\n\n\u201cI commend the governorship candidates of other political parties for the political maturity displayed before and after the poll.\u201d\n\nKalu applauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies, the media, civil society organisations and other stakeholders in ensuring a free and fair poll.\n\n\u2022Fayemi, Bagudu\n\nIn his reaction, Governor Fayemi said APC won because the party has a sellable product in Oyebanji.\n\nHe made the assertions when he led other APC governors, under the Ekiti Governorship Campaign Council to present a copy of the election results to Oyebanji in his home town, Ikogosi.\n\nFayemi who was accompanied by Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State and Mohammed Abubakar of Jigawa, said there were all manners of pundits and analyses, which put the stakeholders on their toes and pushed them to work harder for the success of the election.\n\nHe said there were those who predicted victory for other parties, while there were those who said APC would \u201ccarry the day\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve victory, not just because of the hardwork of our party.\n\n\u201cThis is a candidate that is very well known to Ekiti people, someone who started demonstrating commitment to the Ekiti project in his twenties.\n\n\u201cSomeone, who acted as the Secretary of the Committee for the creation of Ekiti way back in the nineties.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, if you have someone who was there at the birth of the state at a relatively young age as our candidate.\n\n\u201cHe has served in many government capacities as Commissioner, Chief of Staff and other positions in both my administration and that of the first elected governor of the state, Otunba Niyi Adebayo.\n\n\u201cYou can see that the trajectory has been very clear, has been on the upswing, has been very focussed on making Ekiti better.\n\n\u201cThe results of the governorship election is significant.\n\n\u201cIt is a statement about the quality of our candidate and a statement about the confidence reposed in us for having serve them meritoriously in the last four years,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nBagudu, who doubled as the Chairman of Ekiti APC Governorship Campaign Council, revealed that for APC to have won the election with over 100,000 vote margin compared to less than 20,000 recorded in 2018 confirmed how well Fayemi had done in improving the lives of the people.\n\n\u2022Abiodun, Oyetola\n\nIn the same vein, Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, said the victory indicated that the outgoing governor had performed in office to the admiration of Ekiti people.\n\nAbiodun, while saying that the people have spoken through the ballot, commended INEC for conducting a free and fair governorship election.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, said outcome of the exercise was a true reflection of their wishes and aspirations.\n\nHe said he was confident that the governor-elect would reciprocate the mandate given him by delivering quality governance and dividends of democracy to the people of the state.\n\nOyetola also lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for enhancing the credibility of the electoral process with the peaceful conduct of the poll.\n\nHe also commended security agencies, political parties and their candidates, and the people of Ekiti for the peaceful and successful conduct of the election.\n\n\u2022APC mocks PDP\n\nThe APC has mocked the opposition PDP for finishing third in the race.\n\nA statement by the National Publicity Secretary (NPS), Felix Morka said the victory was an eloquent testimony of the acceptance of the APC under the leadership of President Buhari, National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, commitment of members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and accomplishments of Governor Fayemi.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) finished a distant third position in the just-concluded election. Despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission of Nigeria, the people of Ekiti State, and by extension, Nigerians are not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only seeks a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\u201d\n\n\u2022Inspiration for more victories \u2013Tinubu\n\nAPC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said the victory would motivate and inspire the party for more victories in the coming elections.\n\nHe also congratulated the Governor-elect, APC governors, and his party for victory in the governorship election.\n\nAsiwaju Tinubu commended Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion he brought into the campaign, which he said paid off with the emphatic and outstanding victory.\n\nTinubu was also full of praise for the party\u2019s governors and members of National Working Committee under the leadership of Senator Abdullahi Adamu for recording their first major electoral victory. He charged them not to relent in their efforts to lead the party to greater victory in 2023 general elections.\n\n\u2022Precursor to Osun, 2023 election success \u2013Adamu\n\nThe party National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, declared that the victory is precursor to the victories at next month\u2019s Osun State gubernatorial election and 2023 general elections.\n\nIn a letter congratulating the governor-elect, he described the victory as the result of his popularity and strong campaign strategies put in place by the party.\n\nAdamu said Oyebanji has the pedigree, experience and vision to take Ekiti State to the next level of development.\n\nHe also thanked the people of Ekiti State for reposing their confidence in the APC and Oyebanji, promising that the new governor would continue to implement the people oriented programmes of the party already started by the outgoing governor, Kayode Fayemi.\n\nThe chairman also paid glowing tribute to President Buhari saying: \u201cAs leader of the APC, he provided guidance for the party going into the Ekiti State election.\u201d\n\n\u2022Replicate gains of Ekiti in 2023 polls, NILVEJ tasks INEC\n\nThe Nigeria League of Veteran Journalists (NILVEJ) wants the successes and gains achieved by the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC in the Ekiti State governorship election to be sustained and replicated in the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, the National President of the League, Chief Oliver Okpala hailed INEC for what he described as a \u2018wonderful performance\u2019 in the Ekiti Governorship poll.\n\nOkpala said the early arrival and delivery of electoral material at polling units as well as prompt commencement of accreditation and voting made the exercise hitch free and transparent for all to see.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

This cut off the loss of interest and which was associated with the earlier method of accreditation, going away to wait before coming back to vote at a later time.

Wike also stayed away from the event.\n\nA top party source told Daily Sun that those aggrieved by Okowa\u2019s emergence, realising that there is nothing they can do about it have decided to be indifferent to the affairs of the party.\n\nAnother source claimed that the lack of unity in the party and indifference of the governors stalled the grand finale of the PDP governorship campaign in Ekiti State, last Thursday as it became difficult mobilising party leaders for the programme.\n\nThe source, who expressed disappointment over the poor performance of the PDP in the Ekiti gubernatorial poll said: \u201cThe recent issues in the party contributed greatly to our lose.\u201d\n\nAnother official confirmed that feelings of resentments and disappointments were normal in an election contest where there were winners and losers, but the party has a dispute resolution mechanism to handle the issues.\n\n\u201cThe governors have not stated any position publicly or privately.

Buhari, however, advised Oyebanji to be magnanimous in victory, in a release yesterday by the president\u2019s media adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\n\n\nThe president said the APC candidate\u2019s victory was well-deserved, considering his contributions to the development of the state and the party before his nomination, but it was also an indication of the people\u2019s confidence in the ruling party.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at his Ikogosi-Ekiti country home, Oyebanji assured that he would not disappoint the people.\n\n\n\nThe assurance came as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the governorship election, Olabisi Kolawole, congratulated the winner, describing his victory as a popular choice to which he convincingly conceded defeat.\n\n\n\nMany prominent Nigerians hailed APC and its candidate over their victory at the poll. They included National Chairman of APC, Abdulahi Adamu; presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu; President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; outgoing governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo.\n\n\n\nWhile urging Oyebanji to be benevolent in victory in the interest of the people, Buhari also rejoiced with Adamu and the APC National Working Committee (NWC) for a successful outing, the first in the tenure of the newly elected executives of the party.\n\n\n\nThe president told the APC national chairman, \u201cThis is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari charged all APC members within and outside the country to see the victory in Ekiti State as a good omen for the 2023 general election and work diligently to ensure the party\u2019s success. He urged a continuation of the winning trend in the Osun State governorship poll in July.\n\n\n\nFelicitating with the people of Ekiti State for the smooth conduct of the election, Buhari affirmed that they were the real victors, as they were able to freely choose their leader for the next four years.\n\nHe also lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the law enforcement agencies for their conducts, and urged them to keep the momentum in future elections.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Oyebanji promised never to disappoint or betray the confidence reposed in him by Ekiti people. He said his victory marked a watershed in the history of the state, saying it would translate into prosperity and growth, as he builds and improves on the legacies of the previous administrations.\n\n\n\nThe APC governorship candidate polled an aggregate of 187, 057 votes to defeat Chief Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), who came a distant second with 82, 209 votes, while Kolawole of PDP scored 67, 457 votes to place third.\n\n\n\nOyebanji lauded the electorate in the state for the overwhelming confidence in him, and assured that he would hit the ground running with his agenda for growth and turnaround of the state.\n\nHe commended INEC and the security agencies for delivering to Ekiti State a free, fair and credible poll, in line with the decision of the majority of people in the state.\n\n\n\nCommending the other contestants in the election for adding credibility to the contest with their noble and enviable conducts, Oyebanji stated that before his inauguration on October 16, he would be meeting them to source ideas towards the development of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI thank all other aspirants and their respective political parties for the dignified way they carried out their campaigns, and for contributing to the credibility of the process.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will be seeking audience with you all in the coming days, to benefit from your wealth of ideas on how to develop our dear state \u2013 to complement our vision and blueprint for the accelerated development of Ekiti. You have all performed creditably and earned places of honour in the history of our state.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn those who lost their lives in some of the isolated violent incidents during the electioneering period, Oyebanji said, \u201cI use this opportunity to once again convey my condolences to the families of our kinsmen, who died in the pockets of pre-election violence. I join my voice with that of all well-meaning Ekiti kete to the call for full investigations into the incidences and ensure justice is done.\u201d\n\nKolawole: Your Victory is Popular Choice\n\nThe candidate of PDP in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Otunba Olabisi Kolawole, congratulated the APC candidate and winner of the election, Mr Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is a popular choice.\n\nIn a congratulatory letter he personally signed, Kolawole said, \u201cFollowing the announcement of your victory in the June 18 Ekiti governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), I hereby write to congratulate you accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe that power belongs to God and He bestows upon whoever he chooses. I also believe in popular choice that the unfettered expression of the peoples mandate as one of the crucial hallmarks of democratic principle and practice.\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocracy must, therefore, deliver to the people dividends of security or protection and enhance their social welfare and well-being basically, among other deliverables.\n\n\u201cThese were the motivation for my own ambition in the governorship of Ekiti State, which I feel strongly to reiterate here in view of the precarious situation of our people at the moment.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease, take urgent actions aimed at redressing the plights of our people when you fully assume the mantle shortly. Finally, I wish you the guidance of the Almighty God in the onerous task ahead.\u201d\n\nAdamu: Ekiti Victory is Precursor of Future APC Victories\n\nNational Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, yesterday, said the victory recorded in the Ekiti State governorship election by the party was a foretaste of expected victories in future polls. Adamu stated this in his letter of congratulations to the governor-elect, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, signed by the senate president\u2019s Senior Special Assistant (SSA), Dr Samuel Jimba.\n\n\n\nAdamu said the victory recorded in the first election in his tenure as national chairman of APC was as a result of the popularity of Oyebanji\u2019s candidature, as well as the robust campaign strategy put in place by the party.\n\nHe paid tribute to the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, who, as leader of APC, provided guidance for the party as it went into the Ekiti election.\n\nThe senate president promised Buhari that the party would continue to be guided by wisdom in all future elections for the consolidation of his legacies.\n\nTinubu: Ekiti Victory Will Motivate APC for More in 2023\n\nPresidential candidate of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the party\u2019s victory in the Ekiti State governorship election would spur it on to more victories in the coming elections. In a statement yesterday by his media office, Tinubu congratulated Oyebanji and the party for winning the governorship election.

This victory is our victory as members of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis feat should motivate and inspire us as we go for more victories in the coming elections. I must commend the now outgoing governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his team, whose progressive leadership in Ekiti made it possible for APC to retain government for the next four years. I am confident that the governor will finish well and strong.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking the people of Ekiti once again for standing by APC, I urge them and, indeed, the generality of Nigerians to continue to maintain their faith and confidence in our party.\u201d\n\nFayemi: Ekiti People Have Spoken Loud and Clear\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, congratulated the leadership of APC on the victory, and also lauded the Ekiti electorate, whom he said spoke loud and clear through the ballot box.\n\n\n\nIn a message of congratulations in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, Fayemi described Oyebanji\u2019s victory as well-deserved, saying it is a befitting honour for a man, who, in the last three decades, has committed his time, energy, talent and resources to the development of the state.\n\n\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cEkiti people have spoken loud and clear.

He said the progressive nature of the Ekiti people as well as their culture of reciprocating good gestures were what played in Oyebanji\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cI must note that our party, the All Progressives Congress, and its government under the able leadership of Governor Kayode Fayemi has delivered beyond the expectations of the Ekiti people. I, therefore, believe it was only natural for the citizens to reciprocate by voting for our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur confidence was further buoyed by the quality of candidates presented for the governorship poll. The combination of Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji and his deputy, Mrs Monisade Christiana Afuye, is what Ekiti needs to continue with the great work started by the outgoing governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cI once again congratulate the winners for running a good race and emerging victorious. I also congratulate my brother-governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who has set a winning template for the party, with good governance over the years.\u201d\n\nLawan: Ekiti is Indicative of 2023 General Election\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, while congratulating the APC candidate in the Ekiti governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, said the outcome of the exercise was indicative of what to expect in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, Lawan also congratulated APC, both at the state and national levels, and the people of Ekiti State on the peaceful and successful conduct of the poll, and for making the right choice. He said the outcome of the election further demonstrated the trust and confidence of Nigerians across the country in APC.\n\n\n\nLawan said democracy had continued to get stronger in Nigeria under the APC federal government led by President Muhammadu Buhari. He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for delivering a poll that had been widely adjudged as free, fair, transparent and hitch-free, and wished the governor-elect God\u2019s guidance as he prepared for the onerous task ahead.\n\nAPC: Fayemi\u2019s Achievements Laid Foundation for Our Victory\n\nThe APC leadership has said the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, provided a solid foundation for the decisive victory of the party in the just concluded governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, in a statement, said without a doubt, the well-deserved victory in Ekiti State was an eloquent testimony to the acceptance of the party under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the sagacity of Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of members of the NWC.\n\nAPC said, not surprisingly, the opposition PDP came a distant third position in the election, despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission in Nigeria. It stressed that the people of Ekiti State and, by extension, Nigerians were not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only sought a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\n\n\n\nAPC stated, \u201cAs we savour the joy and euphoria of victory in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti State, the All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to congratulate and profoundly appreciate the wonderful people of Ekiti State for reaffirming their confidence in our party by rallying round the governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji.\n\n\u201cIt bears mentioning that the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode John Fayemi, provided a solid predicate for this decisive victory. We thank you for your service to your state and country.\u201d\n\n\n\nAPC urged the people of Ekiti State and Nigerians, in general, to sustain their support for the party by voting overwhelmingly for all APC candidates in subsequent elections.\n\nAkeredolu: BAO, APC Victory Symbolic\n\nChairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), congratulated the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and winner of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is symbolic.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu also saluted the people of the state for the smooth conduct of the exercise.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the governor described the victory as an unequivocal testament to the acceptability of APC and the excellent performance of the incumbent, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.\n\n\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cI congratulate my brother, Biodun Oyebanji Abayomi, on this victory. I rejoice with our great party, the APC. I salute the people of Ekiti for their resilience and peaceful conduct. This victory is for the people of Ekiti State and all lovers of democracy across the country. It is a mark of renewed commitment of the people to our party, the APC.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt, BAO\u2019s vast experience in public service is an asset that would be deployed for the good of the people of Ekiti State. As a former commissioner, Chief of Staff, and later Secretary to the State Government, the governor-elect is well equipped to take the state to the next level.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that BAO will consolidate on the gains of the outgoing administration of Governor Fayemi and leverage on the continuity of our party in government to further deliver dividends of good governance to the people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is our first win since the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the presidential candidate of our party. This election is, however, symbolic as it shows the preparedness and commitment of our people to vote en masse for the APC in next year\u2019s general election.\u201d\n\nHouse Lauds INEC over Ekiti Governorship Election\n\nThe House of Representatives lauded INEC for the successful conduct of the governorship election in Ekiti State, which has been adjudged a triumph for democracy, according to metrics by independent domestic and foreign observers.\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers, in a statement by their spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also commended the Nigeria Police, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and other security agencies for keeping the peace and demonstrating vigilance against electoral malpractices.\n\n\n\nWhile assuring of their commitment to the improvement of the electoral processes, the House expressed optimism that the successful run of the election in Ekiti would inspire more Nigerians to vote in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAs the first gubernatorial election to be conducted by INEC under the new Electoral Act 2022, the election presented a unique opportunity to assess the operational implications of some provisions of the newly issued INEC guidelines and the Electoral Act 2022, which was recently passed by the National Assembly under the leadership of the distinguished Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, and the Honourable Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports from independent election observers, there was marked improvement in election logistics management, as well as the deployment of personnel and essential materials, such as the Voter Register, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), voting cubicles, and ballot boxes, which resulted in early commencement of voting.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe House is also pleased with reports that the BVAS functioned properly in 94% of observed polling units, and was promptly fixed in the 6% of polling units where it malfunctioned. This, indeed, validates the faith that was placed in INEC to deploy election technology to improve our electoral system.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe House also seizes this opportunity to call on INEC to extend the June 30th voter registration deadline to accommodate the increasing number of Nigerians who wish to register to vote.\u201d\n\nIG Hails Ekiti Electorate, as PSC Salutes Police Performance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Baba commended the electorate in Ekiti State for cooperating with the Nigeria Police and other security agencies in the governorship election.\n\n\n\nIn a similar vein, the Police Service Commission (PSC), which supervised the police officers deployed during the poll, confirmed that the election was largely peaceful and orderly and commended its men.\n\n\n\nThe IG also lauded the efforts of the police officers deployed for the poll, under the direct supervision of Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of election security, DIG Johnson Babatunde Kokumo.\n\nThe IG noted that the police officers conducted themselves professionally, which built trust with the electorate and, ultimately, led to a successful electoral process.\n\n\n\nA statement last night by the Force Headquarters said the IG emphasised that the timely situation reports released by the police effectively covered all communication gaps with the people and eliminated every iota of doubt regarding the massive security presence in the state.\n\n\n\nThe police chief, while admonishing Nigerians to toe the line of peaceful conduct in forthcoming elections, assured all citizens of improved management of security during electioneering processes. He called on well meaning Nigerians, particularly, the electorate and political actors, to accord necessary support to the police and other security agencies in the 2023 general election, and in the Osun State\u2019s off-season governorship election, slated for July.\n\n\n\nThe PSC, in a statement by its head of Press and Public Relations, Mr Ikechukwu Ani, affirmed that the Ekiti election was a huge improvement and good test-run for the 2023 elections.\n\nSERAP Urges INEC to Prosecute Vote Buyers or Face Legal Action\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) gave the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, seven days to gather information about reports of vote-buying, undue influence, intimidation, ballot box snatching, and other electoral offences by the three leading political parties in the just concluded governorship election in Ekiti State.\n\nSERAP also urged INEC to promptly and effectively prosecute those arrested, and bring to justice anyone who sponsored, aided and abetted them.\n\n\n\nIn a letter dated June 18, 2022 and signed by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said corruption of the ballot box intruded on the freedom of Nigerian voters to make up their minds and vote buying and other forms of electoral corruption froze out the less wealthy candidates and parties.\n\nSERAP said if voting was as important as INEC always claimed, now was the time to end the buying of democracy by wealthy politicians and their sponsors.\n\n\n\nThe letter read, in part, \u201cVote buying encourages poor governance and weakens citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their \u2018elected officials\u2019 accountable for their actions. When political candidates or their sponsors decide to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidates and sponsors will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\n\n\u201cThere are reports of a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery in several polling units during the just concluded Ekiti governorship election. There are reports of bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings and bags of foodstuff being shared after votes have been cast.\n\n\n\n\u201cActing swiftly to address the brazen impunity and reports of vote-buying and electoral bribery and other electoral offences during the Ekiti State governorship election would also send a strong message to politicians that INEC, under your watch, would not tolerate such practices during the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\n\u201cProsecuting allegations of vote-buying, undue influence, ballot snatching, intimidation, and other electoral malpractices during the Ekiti State governorship election would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the country\u2019s international human rights anti-corruption obligations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within within days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\nSituation Room Affirms Vote Buying Rampant in Ekiti Poll\n\nThe Situation Room, a civil society coalition, said it observed the incidence of vote buying and selling going on unabated during the election in Ekiti State.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued by Convener of the Situation Room, Eneh Obi, the group said vote buying during the Ekiti election followed a familiar pattern of similar across the country, and in particular, the 2014 governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nObi stated, \u201cThe description of this phenomenon as \u2018stomach Infrastructure\u2019 in the 2014 election has evolved into a new nomenclature now described as \u2018See and Buy\u2019. The ability of Ekiti politicians to make light of such a grave violation of extant law is most unfortunate. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, the Situation Room said the election was generally peaceful, with voters playing a key part in the peaceful election environment and commended voters for their comportment at the various polling centres.\n\nIt noted that INEC\u2019s strategy of voters\u2019 redistribution failed to address the problem of over concentration of voters in some polling units.\n\n\n\nAccording to the election monitoring group, a glaring example was the situation at Surajudeen School, Ado Dallimore (Ward 9), Ado Ekiti LGA, which had about five thousand registered voters shared between just two polling units.\n\n\n\nIt said some of the voters complained that their request for transfer of registration to their preferred polling units was not approved before this exercise.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Fintechs have continued to encroach on commercial banks\u2019 businesses, thereby threatening the operations and deposit mobilisation by the banks.\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee recently stated that the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR) of the banking industry has remained above their prudential limits at 14.6 and 43.7 per cent, respectively. Also, the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio of the industry stood at 5.3 per cent in April 2022, compared with its prudential limit of five per cent, reflecting sustained stability in the banking system, though there remains a need to bring this down to the prudential limit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022EFCC arrests vote buyers\n\nKunle Aderinokun in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado-Ekiti\n\n\n\nThe governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, was this early morning declared the winner of yesterday\u2019s governorship poll after sweeping 15 out of the 16 local government areas (LGAs) in the state.\n\nThe governorship election, which was held under a calm and peaceful atmosphere, also recorded a large turnout of voters.\n\nThe poll was however characterised by vote-buying in all the 16 LGAs in the state, leading to the intervention of the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), who arrested some vote-buyers.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Oyebanji scored 187,057 votes to defeat his main challenger and governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr. Segun Oni, who came a distant second with 82,211 votes, while the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Bisi Kolawole garnered 67,457 votes to clinch the third position.\n\nHowever, while the APC and PDP won in 15 and one local government area, respectively, the SDP did not win any LGA.\n\nSixteen political parties participated in the election.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Returning Officer, Prof. Oyebode Adebowale, APC won in Ado-Ekiti, Ikere, Emure, Ijero, Ilejemeje, Ekiti South West, Ekiti West, Ekiti East, Moba, Oye, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Ise/Orun, Aiyekire/Gbonyin, Ido-Osi, and Ikole LGAs.\n\nWhile Irepodun/Ifelodun is the LGA of former governor Ayo Fayose, who was the main backer of the PDP candidate, Ido-Osi is the LGA of the governorship candidate of SDP, Oni.\n\nIkole is the LGA of Kemi Elebute-Halle, the candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP).\n\nThe candidate of the PDP, Kolawole, was announced the winner in Efon Alaye LGA, while Oni of the SDP did not win a single LGA.\n\nThe winner of the governorship election, Oyebanji, is a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), to Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\nEFCC Arrests Vote Buyers, Election Calm, Peaceful\n\nFollowing the widespread vote-buying, which characterised the governorship election, the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested persons suspected to be engaged in vote-buying in the poll.\n\nSome of the suspects were paraded at the Oke Ori Omi Area Division of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nThe suspects were reported to have been caught with bundles of cash allegedly used for vote-buying.\n\nSome other persons were also arrested at a private residence with a book containing details of voters of a certain voting area.\n\nThough the election was said to be calm and peaceful, sponsored thugs had a field day destroying ballot boxes in the stronghold of opposition parties in Ise Ekiti and Ilawe Ekiti Polling Units.\n\nBallot boxes in Ilasa, Polling Unit 001 in Ekiti East, another stronghold of the opposition party, were destroyed by sponsored thugs.\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room (Situation Room), which observed the election, said in a statement that it received reports of widespread vote-buying by political party agents across the 16 LGAs in the state.\n\n\u201cIn many instances, voters were induced with money ranging from N4,500 to N10,000 by asking them to flag completed ballot papers as proof of voting in a specified manner in what they term \u2018See and Buy\u2019. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law,\u201d said the statement.\n\nSituation Room noted that the election was generally peaceful, with voters civilly conducting themselves in most of the polling units.\n\nIt, however, observed that the redistribution of voters done by INEC still did not take care of the issue of a huge population of voters in some polling units as many new polling units had abysmally low numbers while older polling units remain overcrowded.\n\n\u201cThere were also polling units sited in private residences such as PU006 Omiragunsin\u2019s House, Okemesi Ward 1, Ekiti West LGA and PU003 in front of Ezekiel\u2019s House Iroro/Ita Alafia Iroro Imegun, Ward 3 Araromi Omuo, Ekiti East LGA,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSituation Room, which commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), noted the early arrival of poll officials and election materials in 93 per cent of the polling units observed.\n\nAccording to the group, polls commenced before 9 a.m. in at least 88 per cent of the locations, which it described as an improvement of both the Anambra State Governorship Election 2021 and FCT Area Councils Elections 2022.\n\nSituation Room observed that the Bi-Modal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) was functional in at least 76 per cent of the voting locations.\n\n\u201cHowever, there have been many reports of delays and malfunctioning BVAS machines in some voting units especially those with many registered voters. Examples of the locations where the machines malfunctioned are PU 002 Igbaletere by Mechanic Workshop, Ward 6 Ado Okeyinmi, Ado-Ekiti LGA where the Machine was going on and off intermittently, PU 007 LA Primary School Oke Afin, Otun Ward III and PU018 Igogo Ward II both in Moba LGA where the BVAS failed, and PU 014, Ward I Okemesi, Ekiti West LGA, amongst others. Furthermore, INEC\u2019s distribution of the BVAS devices was not proportionate to the population of registered voters by polling unit,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked INEC to prosecute all those involved in vote-buying in the governorship election.\n\nSERAP in a short tweet last night said the prosecution must not end with those caught in the act but must be extended to the politicians who funded their election malpractice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A lecturer in the Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social and Management Sciences of the Nigeria Police Academy (POLAC), Wudil, Kano State, Dr. Goddy Osa Igbaekemen has accused the First City Monument Bank (FCMB) of conspiring with the principal officers of the academy to withhold his monthly salary, make illegal deductions in his account and unlawfully withhold his bank transaction alerts.\n\nIgbaekemen obtained a loan from the FCMB on the 27th June, 2014 which was due to be paid up in August 2021 from the bank's successive deductions from his salary account.\n\nBut after the duration of repayment, as contained in the agreement between him and the bank, and subsequent intervention by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), FCMB denied him access to his account and all attempts to get the bank to explain to him in writing the reason for the blockage were not successful.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 1, Kano State on August 7, 2020, Dr. Igbaekemen explained that on June 24, 2020, he was compelled by three staff of the FCMB including Jimoh Mutiu, Waheed Olabode and Mamu Mohammed to write and they approved his request for palliatives of 3% of his monthly salaries.\n\nHe said he received the 3% of his salaries until the management of the academy (the Nigeria Police Academy) released his salaries arrears, but when he went to FCMB branch in Abuja in anticipation of the approved palliatives of 3%, the payment failed. When he called Mr. Jimoh, he said that they had reneged from the initial palliatives arrangement and that the bank requested for restructuring of the loan.\n\nDr. Igbaekemen said that while he was processing the restructuring with Mr. Jimoh, Mohammed, Waheed and FCMB Abuja branch, \u201cFCMB unlawfully withdrew all the salaries in my account, N500,000 without adherence to CBN guidelines and extant rules on salaries loan.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Jimoh confirmed that they are restructuring the loan for three years as against the initial five years the salaries loan lasted till July 2019.\n\nHe fulfilled the restructuring requirements on August 4, 2020, but he did not have access to his bank account and the money in the account.\n\n\u201cTill date, I do not have access to my bank account\u2026. as a result of the observed conspiracy between the above named FCMB staff and POLAC leadership.\u201d\n\nDr. Igbaekemen said he has also petitioned the principal officers of the academy and the Bank \u201cfor Criminal Breach of Trust, Cheating, Deceit, Abuse of powers and unlawful acts by the staff of the bank, in conspiracy with the management of the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil.\u201d\n\nHe said he reported the matter to the Director, Consumer Protection Unit of the CBN in a letter dated 24th February, 2022 and also sent a reminder letter dated 4th April, 2022. He also wrote to the head of Collection and Recovery Unit of the FCMB in a letter dated 26th January, 2022.\n\nHe alleged that the FCMB staff in Kano in his explanation had, among other things, said that CBN formally stopped the loan deductions from August 2021 but they decided to engaged in manual deductions in order not reflect in CBN platform and his personal bank account alerts.\n\n\u201cThey initially stopped to cover the fraud, hence they placed non indebtedness on my bank account account and it reflected in all the branches nationwide and FCMB marketers began to call me for a fresh loan.\n\n\u201cI went to FCMB Bank in Central Business District, Abuja to collect and I filled non-indebtedness form on January 11, 2022 but this bank staff failed to document his explanation in writing for further interrogation and he declined same so it could not be used as evidence.\u201d\n\nHe also reported the issue to the FCMB Managing Director through the Manager of Central Business District, Abuja in a letter dated January 10, 2022.\n\nDr. Igbaekemen said that he formally wrote to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, in a letter dated 22nd July 2021, where he reported that investigation into the gross misconduct with respect to his salary account was compromised.\n\nHowever, till date, \u201cthe illegality still continues without POLAC management intervention in the issue.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that despite all the efforts he made, no attempt has been made by the authorities of the FCMB to resolve the issue which, according to him, has caused him a lot of financial discomfort.\n\nHowever, when SaharaReporters contacted Mr. Jimoh of the FCMB about Dr. Igbaekemen\u2019s complaints, he said that the matter is complicated.\n\n\u201cHe had a loan and the loan was bad because it was illegally suspended by the POLAC and it was reinstated. Then we advised him to restructure the account so that he can have access to his salaries. Along the line, there was a system error and the account was erroneously turned into a bad account again.\n\n\u201cWe advised him to stop the account so that they would stop the deduction until we resolve the account and be able to determine how much he has paid, what is remaining and how he would pay it, whether by installment or he would continue with the deduction,\u201d Jimoh said.\n\nHe said that his supervisor was already working on the issue as there had been a report from the CBN to them about it.\n\nHe also admitted that after the account was reinstated, Dr. Igbaekemen received some salaries and because his loan balance was over N3 million and when he was paid, they took some part of the money.\n\n\u201cOut of the N500,000, we remitted N200,000 for him pending when we would resolve the issue. I was the one that restructured the account in 2020 and if there had not been a system error, I know in the next one or two years, he would have completed the loan,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked if Dr. Igbaekemen had access to his account, Jimoh answered in affirmation after running a brief check on the account.\n\n\u201cHe has access to the account.

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), through its harmonisation exercise, has allegedly denied some officers promotion for about 20 years, while some of their colleagues recruited much later after have been promoted up to two times.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the affected officers include CNA conversion course 1/2008 which comprised NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98, who were already on CNA rank earlier before January 2004; with effective dates of promotion to ASNII dating back to 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 for NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98 respectively.\n\nHowever, sources in the agency told SaharaReporters that while the affected officers\u2019 promotions have been stagnated for more than 15 years, those employed in \u201c2011, mostly candidates of political office holders, enjoyed double promotions ahead and above their older colleagues whom they met on the job and were stagnated on level 7 and below\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe sources said that their promotions have been cumulatively stagnated for about 10 to 20 years which translates to a loss of three to six ranks.\n\n\n\nWhile admitting that they were promoted by one rank in the 2021 harmonisation exercise, one of the sources, however, pointed out that the promotion still kept them below their juniors who have received multiple promotions backdated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most recent NA course who were recruited as SNAs 13 to 17 years after our recruitment, and 4 to 7 years after our ideal ASN II effective dates, were promoted ahead of us going by their effective dates,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the stagnation of their careers and distortion of their seniority in the service predates 2014, adding that \u201cby 2014, some of us were already stagnated for up to 10 years\u201d.\n\n\n\nExplaining the process of conversion and how their promotion has been lopsidedly stagnated, another source said, \u201cThe criteria for successful conversion to the superintendent cadre is that the officer should have additional qualifications and attend mandatory conversion course.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the requirement of additional qualifications was waived for conversion courses 1 and 2 in favour of years of service and attainment of 50% cut-off mark as against 40% in normal promotion examinations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have served and kept fate with the agency in deprivation, and denied most of our benefits for 23 to 27 years, giving our youths, bearing the scars, dangers of the lowest level of servitude while aligning our aspirations to the vision of the agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further explained that against its standard of conducting promotion examinations yearly, NDLEA did not conduct the examinations in 2006 and 2007, thereby denying CNAs who had resit the opportunity of promotion to ASN II with 2005 and 2006 effective dates their due opportunity to be promoted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all CNAs with earlier or 2004 effective dates were made to go through conversion course 1/2008 with no cognizance of the fact that some older NA courses 7/94 and 8/96 were on re-sit. This, the source, said is in contradiction to the normal promotion condition that those on re-sit need only retake their papers to be promoted.\n\nThe imposition of the conversion course on these unprepared sets of officers made them unsuccessful in conversion course 1, it was learnt.\n\n\n\nAlso, though the NDLEA Scheme of Service provides that the conversion course should be yearly, one of the sources said it was not conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and \u201cthis also denied the unsuccessful candidates of conversion course 1, the opportunity of getting back on track with our career progression\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe negative impact was heightened thus,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nBy 2014 when they were eventually promoted to ASN II by virtue of CNA conversion course 2013; their promotion which would have been with effective dates of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were still on CNA for 10, 9, 8, and 7 years after.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect is loss of up to three ranks, meaning that as at 2013/2014 promotions, we would have been on the ranks of CSN, SN and DSN respectively. Though the effective dates of promotion of successful candidates of CNA conversion course 1 were backdated appropriately, that of CNA course 2/2013 converted officers were not backdated,\u201d the source continued.\n\n\n\nHe lamented that the negligence has affected them both financially and psychologically, especially as many of them draw closer to their retirement age.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cAs our juniors are being promoted far ahead of us, we struggle daily with low self-esteem, ridicule, disgrace, indiscipline and shattered self-confidence. Going by our years of service and staring retirement in the face, the bleakness of our service life aspirations confronts us daily. The instances of career stagnation have excluded us from any serious service responsibility like mid-level command responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmongst other things, one of the sources on behalf of the affected officers appealed to the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (Rtd), to place them on their ideal ranks of CSN and ACN and DCN, as this will help them rectify the distorted seniority issues.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that their effective dates of promotions should reflect their ideal career progression save for the loss of seniority through re-sit, and in the event of challenges of federal character and vacancy in their placement, harmonization or promotion to ACN and above, the CSN effective date should reflect their ideal career progression.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, they want the date of their first appointment and subsequent years of service to be used to place them accordingly, while individual service records are sought and used to place them properly with the correct effective dates according to individual peculiarities.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that in line with the NDLEA conditions of service 2019, the issue of additional qualifications should not affect the career progression of converted officers in the area of pegging, considering the fact that it was waived in favour of higher cut-off marks.",

          "text": "He first observed the previously colourless river turning brown in July 2019 while catnapping at the riverbank after fishing for the day. Prior to his discovery, Razaq Femi made at least N5,000 in daily returns from fishing along the coast of the river. But by November 2019, when the colour change had come to stay, he noticed the fish starting to dwindle, and his income took a tumble.\n\nFemi says he thought it was a natural occurrence.\n\nBy April 2020 when most parts of the world were on lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the water, according to Femi, had completely turned brown. At that point, the 37-year-old said his fellow fishermen began to ask questions and were ultimately able to trace the contamination to the mining activities in Osogbo, the capital of Osun state.\n\nThe fishermen, over 500 of them, were not sure of what was being mined. What was clear to them was their progressively dwindling income, and after it nosedived to N200 in 2022, many abandoned Asejire in search of other rivers to make ends meet. But not Femi; he still visits occasionally in the hope that things might change while his wife\u2019s income keeps the family running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy wife has been the one feeding me and the children. The income is now so low,\u201d he said, evidently rattled but resigned to fate.\n\n\u201cI can spend hours here without catching a single fish a whole day. Before your arrival, I was just trying to see if the net had caught some fish. Nothing is inside. We need help over this river.\u201d\n\nSince the early 1950s, gold mining operations have been a permanent fixture in Osun state, although the majority of the activity has been illegal. The quest for gold continuously attracts commercial and artisanal miners, resulting in an influx of mining workers and labourers, predominantly from northern Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as the gold particles are sieved away from the ore, the impact is felt by the Asejire dam which supplies drinking water to some parts of Oyo and communities surrounding the Osun river.\n\nFollowing the water\n\nBuilt in the late 1960s, the Asejire dam sits on the Osun river, about 30 kilometres east of Ibadan, Oyo state. The river borders Osun and Oyo.\n\nUsing Google Earth\u2019s satellite imagery, and with the aid of a drone, TheCable was able to trace the source of the pollution to Ilesa communities (otherwise called Ijesha) in Osun.\n\nIjesha land is renowned for large gold deposits and other minerals in considerable proportion. Due to the heightened mining activity, waste, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and chemicals are washed into the river after the miners must have used the water pressure to separate gold from ore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarge-scale surface gold mines can make use of between 60,000 and 100,000 cubic meters (16 million and 26 million gallons) of water each day.\n\nGoogle Earth revealed that many rivers are tributaries of the Osun river. One of them is the Oora river in a small Ijesha village that bears the same name. The Oora river has its source in Ilesa town.\n\nFlying at a high altitude, the drone captured an obstruction of the flow at a point on the Oora river for alluvial gold mining.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe main source of livelihood for Oora residents is farming, and with their water now turned brown, they are unable to irrigate their farms. Residents say before the arrival of the miners, they also relied on the water for consumption and other uses.\n\nAjao Ajeigbe, a car wash owner in Ilesa, said residents assumed that the change in the colour of the water was a passing phase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all thought it\u2019s something that will fade off in no time. You can see that it has come to stay. We use it to wash our bodies and wash cars. But we are scared to drink it,\u201d Ajeigbe said.\n\nBefore the river turned brown, Ajeigbe said he and his family depended on it for consumption and irrigation of their nearby vegetable farm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sacred grove desecrated\n\nThe Os\u0323un river is named after one of the most popular and venerated deities in Yorubaland.\n\nThe annual traditional worship at the Osun-Osogbo grove has become a popular pilgrimage and important tourist attraction, drawing people from all over Nigeria and the world.\n\nThe Os\u0323un goddess is believed in Yoruba cosmology to be the provider of the needs of the people and the god of fertility.\n\nIn 1965, the \u1ecc\u1e63un-Osogbo grove was declared a national monument, while in 2005, it was pronounced one of the world\u2019s heritage sites.\n\nOn the first visit to the grove, many worshippers were found milling about. One of them, Aina Oladeinde, was praying to the river goddess for the grace to win a N30 million road construction contract.\n\nOladeinde had travelled from Lagos for the special prayers. He credited the river\u2019s supernatural power for his mother\u2019s ability to conceive him after many years of being without a child, so it was only natural that he believes in the efficacy of the water. Oladeinde says whenever he drinks the water and prays with it, his wishes always manifest.\n\nAfter the brief conversation, Oladeinde returned to his prayers, said a little incantation, scooped the water with his hand, and poured it into his mouth. He washed his face and arms, and then he left. After his exit, this reporter fetched the water sample at the exact spot where he performed his prayers.\n\nLike the oblivious children swimming inside the river at a worship point called Ibu Osain, Oladeinde was similarly unbothered about the impurities that flow through the water.\n\nAnalysis of water samples\n\nTheCable subjected the sample of the water to a test conducted by UNILAG Consult, where it was found to contain 0.034 milligrams per litre (mg/L) of arsenic, 5.663 mg/L of aluminium, and 0.090 mg/L of lead. Other heavy metals found, according to the test result, include Barium (2.326), Lithium(0.004), Nickel(2.006), and Iron(3.197).\n\nThese heavy metals were found to be significantly above the limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nAccording to the test result, the presence of these metals makes the water unsafe for consumption, bathing, and farming activities.\n\nTheCable also collected water samples from the Asejire dam axis, a well in Akad Ilesa, and a spring in Kajola Ijesha to test for possible heavy metal percolation.\n\nWhile the well water was not found to be contaminated by the nearby mining activities, there was a presence of lead and lithium in the water from Asejire.\n\nAccording to information available on the Oyo government\u2019s website, Asejire and Eleyele water treatment plants account for close to 80 percent of the total water consumption capacity of the state.\n\n\u2018Biggest headache\u2019\n\nAdedoyin Talabi Faniyi, an Osun worshipper and adopted child of Susanne Wenger, was pounding leaves on a carved rock when TheCable got to the Adunni Olorisha building along Ibokun road in Osogbo.\n\nSusanne Wenger, also known as Adunni Olorisha, was an Australian traditionalist who came to Osogbo to preserve the river in 1961.\n\nPopularly known as Doyin Olosun, the priestess expressed worry over the state of the river.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our biggest concern at the moment. The moment we saw it like that some years back, we were so concerned about the cause of it. We kept asking ourselves why. We later heard it\u2019s the effect of mining close to Ilesa,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith its popularity worldwide, there\u2019s nowhere in the world they don\u2019t come to take the water. As I am talking to you, we are still in sadness, we felt it shouldn\u2019t be like this. And the water isn\u2019t the same as it was then. We then noticed that the mining waste has contaminated all of Osun river\u2019s tributaries.\u201d\n\nBut despite the state of the water, Doyin Olosun said the worshippers continue to use it for healing and spiritual purposes.\n\n\u201cEven with its present state, there is no day that we don\u2019t fetch it for our daily usage in terms of making herbal concoctions and for divinity,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur belief in it remains the same. Still, we aren\u2019t content with the colour.\u201d\n\nDanger signs\n\nExperts say short to medium-term exposure to very high levels of arsenic in drinking water can lead to arsenic poisoning, which may cause stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and impaired nerve function. Long-term exposure to even relatively low amounts of arsenic in drinking water, over years or decades, is said to increase the risk of developing certain cancers, including skin, lung, kidney, bladder and liver.\n\nLithium on the other hand may cause diseases of the stomach, intestinal tract, central nervous system, and kidneys.\n\nWith the presence of lead, young children and infants consuming the water are more vulnerable than adults. A dose of lead that may have an insignificant effect on adults can be more deadly for children.\n\nIn children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells.\n\nIn adults, overexposure may cause high blood pressure and damage to the reproductive organs. Additional symptoms may include fever, headaches, fatigue, sluggishness (lethargy), vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), abdominal pain, constipation, joint pain, loss of recently acquired skills, incoordination, listlessness, difficulty sleeping (insomnia), irritability, altered consciousness, hallucinations, and/or seizures.\n\nIn 2010, a devastating lead poisoning outbreak linked to artisanal gold processing in Zamfara state killed hundreds of children under the age of five and left thousands with permanent disabilities.\n\nUrban Alert, a civic-tech initiative leveraging technology to amplify the yearnings of the masses, said a health crisis is inevitable if the over two million people living in more than 20 communities in Osun state continue to get exposed to the contaminated water.\n\n\u201cIn fact, our data has shown that 100,000 people may be facing serious medical challenges before 2032 if the situation is not arrested and the proper remediation process does not begin,\u201d Anthony Adejuwon, Urban Alert team lead, told TheCable.\n\nTo determine the level of heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the Osun-Osogbo river, some lecturers of the department of chemical sciences at Osun State University, in 2015, exposed male and female rats to the water for three weeks. The researchers found that the pollutants in the river were capable of inducing haematological imbalance and liver cell injury. The toxicity induced in blood was found to affect female rats more than males.\n\n\u2018Consumption should be suspended\u2019\n\nThe National Commission for Museums and Monuments called for a stakeholder meeting at the education/heritage building inside the grove on March 30, 2022. Ifa chiefs and traditionalists including the renowned Ifayemi Elebuibon \u2013 the Araba-Awo of Osogbo \u2013 and representatives of the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) were present.\n\nAt the meeting, the stakeholders directed that the public should desist from the consumption of the Osun river water until the pollution is resolved.\n\nOther resolutions of the meeting include:\n\nMining sublease by any licence holder (state government and private firms) should ensure that the company they sublet must have the capacity in terms of technology and reclamation plan while relevant regulators must be carried along.\n\nAlluvial gold mining should be suspended for now until all the issues of pollution are resolved.\n\nConfirmatory tests should be carried out by the Osun state government, through Osun State University, while NESREA carries out another test through the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Studies, OAU.\n\nThe federal ministry of mines and steel development, as well as MIREMCO, should step up their regulatory activities to ensure sustainable mining.\n\nWhy Osun may continue to be at mercy of miners\n\nAbdullahi Binuyo, deputy chief of staff to the governor of Osun, told TheCable that the inclusion of mining activities in the exclusive list of the Nigerian constitution has rendered the state handicapped. Binuyo said the state government has no regulatory power over the activities of the miners.\n\n\u201cI can say to you for certain that a lot of miners are in here that the state government is not officially aware of,\u201d Binuyo said.\n\n\u201cJust like the oil blocs, it\u2019s not the state government that gives it out. That is why we are partnering with the federal government to fish them out, especially NESREA.\u201d\n\nBinuyo said only six of the 100 mineral titles in the state belong to the state government.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the 94 are not officially known to the state government because these are clients of the federal government,\u201d he said, likening the state government to landlords who have no right over their lands.\n\nHe however noted that the state will do everything possible to protect the Osun-Osogbo grove and the Osun river, adding that efforts are underway to test the water for the extent of pollution.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the Osun river is very dear to us. The grove, being a world heritage site, is something the Osun state government will do everything to protect knowing fully well the potential that it is bringing to the state on yearly basis. We cannot let that go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe #SaveOsunRiver advocacy\n\nTo facilitate prompt intervention on the issue, Urban Alert\u2019s Adejuwon and his team have been making spirited efforts to get the authorities\u2019 attention.\n\nIn 2019, the team sought the service of a Geographic Information Science (GIS) expert and was able to determine that gold mining is the cause of pollution.\n\n\u201cWe brought the issue of the colour change of the Osun River to the public space in March 2021 through the hashtag #OsunRiverPollution on Twitter,\u201d Adejuwon told TheCable.\n\n\u201cThe Osun state government reacted by constituting the mineral resources and environmental management committee (MIREMCO) to address the Osun river pollution and all other issues resulting from mining activities in Osun state. Unfortunately, nothing significant was seen to have been done concerning the pollution by the committee.\n\n\u201cThe team also conducted physicochemical and microbial tests on samples collected from four different points on the water. In collaboration with senior researchers from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, the analysis shows that the water has been heavily contaminated with mercury, lead and cyanide.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of the Osun-Osogbo grove?\n\nMany traditionalists and worshippers are worried that the level of contamination of the water may result in the delisting of the Osun Osogbo as a world heritage centre by UNESCO.\n\nUNESCO is one of the major funders of the grove, and if delisted, the bulk of the annual funding will, by default, fall on the shoulder of the state government.\n\n\u201cJust like many concerned residents who wish to speak up and ensure that the Osun River is safe, I am concerned about UNESCO\u2019s move,\u201d Adejuwon said.\n\n\u201cIf UNESCO delists the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove, she will be offering the over 300-year-old grove as a sacrifice on the table of polluters and invaders.\u201d\n\nNESREA: We are monitoring the situation\n\nMohammad Maike, the Osun coordinator of NESREA, told TheCable that the agency has been mandating the mining companies to comply with the proper wastewater recycling process.\n\n\u201cWhen the alert was raised, we mobilised to the site to evaluate the level of damage. We swung into action and traced the source to Iponda. And we are monitoring the situation,\u201d Maike said.\n\nThe state coordinator said miners have been advised to not discharge their wastewater without it being treated.\n\n\u201cWe are trying our best. We have been on them and trying to make sure they are doing the necessary things. This includes the non-discharge of wastewater without treating it. Some of them are complying, and some of them are beginning to engage consultants who will help them. That\u2019s what we have been doing.\u201d\n\nBut while a permanent intervention remains pending, the pollution persists, inefficiently abated.\n\nAll efforts to get the comment of the Oyo water management board proved abortive as staff members said they are not allowed to speak to the press.\n\n\u2018National security issue\u2019\n\nAbiodun Baiyewu, Global Rights Nigeria director, advised the federal government to declare a state of emergency on water bodies in the country.\n\nBayeiwu said Nigeria needs to improve its access to water policy and carry out an audit of the water bodies to ascertain the level of pollution.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to think of this as a national security issue,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, 80 percent of mining is artisanal in nature and more than 90 percent of the law addressed large-scale mining, which means that we are not dealing with the environmental consequences of artisanal mining.\u201d\n\nMayokun Iyaomolere, an environmental officer and founder, Plogging Nigeria Club, said miners in Osun must be compelled to operate within the confines of best environmental practices for the protection of the water bodies.\n\n\u201cIn cases where water pollution arising from mining operations occurs, the parties responsible must be made to carry out necessary remediation efforts to return the water to their baseline state,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation.

After his exit, this reporter fetched the water sample at the exact spot where he performed his prayers.\n\nLike the oblivious children swimming inside the river at a worship point called Ibu Osain, Oladeinde was similarly unbothered about the impurities that flow through the water.\n\nAnalysis of water samples\n\nTheCable subjected the sample of the water to a test conducted by UNILAG Consult, where it was found to contain 0.034 milligrams per litre (mg/L) of arsenic, 5.663 mg/L of aluminium, and 0.090 mg/L of lead. Other heavy metals found, according to the test result, include Barium (2.326), Lithium(0.004), Nickel(2.006), and Iron(3.197).\n\nThese heavy metals were found to be significantly above the limit prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nAccording to the test result, the presence of these metals makes the water unsafe for consumption, bathing, and farming activities.\n\nTheCable also collected water samples from the Asejire dam axis, a well in Akad Ilesa, and a spring in Kajola Ijesha to test for possible heavy metal percolation.\n\nWhile the well water was not found to be contaminated by the nearby mining activities, there was a presence of lead and lithium in the water from Asejire.\n\nAccording to information available on the Oyo government\u2019s website, Asejire and Eleyele water treatment plants account for close to 80 percent of the total water consumption capacity of the state.\n\n\u2018Biggest headache\u2019\n\nAdedoyin Talabi Faniyi, an Osun worshipper and adopted child of Susanne Wenger, was pounding leaves on a carved rock when TheCable got to the Adunni Olorisha building along Ibokun road in Osogbo.\n\nSusanne Wenger, also known as Adunni Olorisha, was an Australian traditionalist who came to Osogbo to preserve the river in 1961.\n\nPopularly known as Doyin Olosun, the priestess expressed worry over the state of the river.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our biggest concern at the moment. The moment we saw it like that some years back, we were so concerned about the cause of it. We kept asking ourselves why. We later heard it\u2019s the effect of mining close to Ilesa,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWith its popularity worldwide, there\u2019s nowhere in the world they don\u2019t come to take the water. As I am talking to you, we are still in sadness, we felt it shouldn\u2019t be like this. And the water isn\u2019t the same as it was then. We then noticed that the mining waste has contaminated all of Osun river\u2019s tributaries.\u201d\n\nBut despite the state of the water, Doyin Olosun said the worshippers continue to use it for healing and spiritual purposes.\n\n\u201cEven with its present state, there is no day that we don\u2019t fetch it for our daily usage in terms of making herbal concoctions and for divinity,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOur belief in it remains the same. Still, we aren\u2019t content with the colour.\u201d\n\nDanger signs\n\nExperts say short to medium-term exposure to very high levels of arsenic in drinking water can lead to arsenic poisoning, which may cause stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and impaired nerve function. Long-term exposure to even relatively low amounts of arsenic in drinking water, over years or decades, is said to increase the risk of developing certain cancers, including skin, lung, kidney, bladder and liver.\n\nLithium on the other hand may cause diseases of the stomach, intestinal tract, central nervous system, and kidneys.\n\nWith the presence of lead, young children and infants consuming the water are more vulnerable than adults. A dose of lead that may have an insignificant effect on adults can be more deadly for children.\n\nIn children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells.\n\nIn adults, overexposure may cause high blood pressure and damage to the reproductive organs. Additional symptoms may include fever, headaches, fatigue, sluggishness (lethargy), vomiting, loss of appetite (anorexia), abdominal pain, constipation, joint pain, loss of recently acquired skills, incoordination, listlessness, difficulty sleeping (insomnia), irritability, altered consciousness, hallucinations, and/or seizures.\n\nIn 2010, a devastating lead poisoning outbreak linked to artisanal gold processing in Zamfara state killed hundreds of children under the age of five and left thousands with permanent disabilities.\n\nUrban Alert, a civic-tech initiative leveraging technology to amplify the yearnings of the masses, said a health crisis is inevitable if the over two million people living in more than 20 communities in Osun state continue to get exposed to the contaminated water.\n\n\u201cIn fact, our data has shown that 100,000 people may be facing serious medical challenges before 2032 if the situation is not arrested and the proper remediation process does not begin,\u201d Anthony Adejuwon, Urban Alert team lead, told TheCable.\n\nTo determine the level of heavy metals and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the Osun-Osogbo river, some lecturers of the department of chemical sciences at Osun State University, in 2015, exposed male and female rats to the water for three weeks. The researchers found that the pollutants in the river were capable of inducing haematological imbalance and liver cell injury. The toxicity induced in blood was found to affect female rats more than males.\n\n\u2018Consumption should be suspended\u2019\n\nThe National Commission for Museums and Monuments called for a stakeholder meeting at the education/heritage building inside the grove on March 30, 2022. Ifa chiefs and traditionalists including the renowned Ifayemi Elebuibon \u2013 the Araba-Awo of Osogbo \u2013 and representatives of the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA) were present.\n\nAt the meeting, the stakeholders directed that the public should desist from the consumption of the Osun river water until the pollution is resolved.\n\nOther resolutions of the meeting include:\n\nMining sublease by any licence holder (state government and private firms) should ensure that the company they sublet must have the capacity in terms of technology and reclamation plan while relevant regulators must be carried along.\n\nAlluvial gold mining should be suspended for now until all the issues of pollution are resolved.\n\nConfirmatory tests should be carried out by the Osun state government, through Osun State University, while NESREA carries out another test through the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Studies, OAU.\n\nThe federal ministry of mines and steel development, as well as MIREMCO, should step up their regulatory activities to ensure sustainable mining.\n\nWhy Osun may continue to be at mercy of miners\n\nAbdullahi Binuyo, deputy chief of staff to the governor of Osun, told TheCable that the inclusion of mining activities in the exclusive list of the Nigerian constitution has rendered the state handicapped. Binuyo said the state government has no regulatory power over the activities of the miners.\n\n\u201cI can say to you for certain that a lot of miners are in here that the state government is not officially aware of,\u201d Binuyo said.\n\n\u201cJust like the oil blocs, it\u2019s not the state government that gives it out. That is why we are partnering with the federal government to fish them out, especially NESREA.\u201d\n\nBinuyo said only six of the 100 mineral titles in the state belong to the state government.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the 94 are not officially known to the state government because these are clients of the federal government,\u201d he said, likening the state government to landlords who have no right over their lands.\n\nHe however noted that the state will do everything possible to protect the Osun-Osogbo grove and the Osun river, adding that efforts are underway to test the water for the extent of pollution.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the Osun river is very dear to us. The grove, being a world heritage site, is something the Osun state government will do everything to protect knowing fully well the potential that it is bringing to the state on yearly basis. We cannot let that go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe #SaveOsunRiver advocacy\n\nTo facilitate prompt intervention on the issue, Urban Alert\u2019s Adejuwon and his team have been making spirited efforts to get the authorities\u2019 attention.\n\nIn 2019, the team sought the service of a Geographic Information Science (GIS) expert and was able to determine that gold mining is the cause of pollution.\n\n\u201cWe brought the issue of the colour change of the Osun River to the public space in March 2021 through the hashtag #OsunRiverPollution on Twitter,\u201d Adejuwon told TheCable.\n\n\u201cThe Osun state government reacted by constituting the mineral resources and environmental management committee (MIREMCO) to address the Osun river pollution and all other issues resulting from mining activities in Osun state. Unfortunately, nothing significant was seen to have been done concerning the pollution by the committee.\n\n\u201cThe team also conducted physicochemical and microbial tests on samples collected from four different points on the water. In collaboration with senior researchers from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, the analysis shows that the water has been heavily contaminated with mercury, lead and cyanide.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of the Osun-Osogbo grove?\n\nMany traditionalists and worshippers are worried that the level of contamination of the water may result in the delisting of the Osun Osogbo as a world heritage centre by UNESCO.\n\nUNESCO is one of the major funders of the grove, and if delisted, the bulk of the annual funding will, by default, fall on the shoulder of the state government.\n\n\u201cJust like many concerned residents who wish to speak up and ensure that the Osun River is safe, I am concerned about UNESCO\u2019s move,\u201d Adejuwon said.\n\n\u201cIf UNESCO delists the Osun Osogbo Sacred Grove, she will be offering the over 300-year-old grove as a sacrifice on the table of polluters and invaders.\u201d\n\nNESREA: We are monitoring the situation\n\nMohammad Maike, the Osun coordinator of NESREA, told TheCable that the agency has been mandating the mining companies to comply with the proper wastewater recycling process.\n\n\u201cWhen the alert was raised, we mobilised to the site to evaluate the level of damage. We swung into action and traced the source to Iponda. And we are monitoring the situation,\u201d Maike said.\n\nThe state coordinator said miners have been advised to not discharge their wastewater without it being treated.\n\n\u201cWe are trying our best. We have been on them and trying to make sure they are doing the necessary things. This includes the non-discharge of wastewater without treating it. Some of them are complying, and some of them are beginning to engage consultants who will help them. That\u2019s what we have been doing.\u201d\n\nBut while a permanent intervention remains pending, the pollution persists, inefficiently abated.\n\nAll efforts to get the comment of the Oyo water management board proved abortive as staff members said they are not allowed to speak to the press.\n\n\u2018National security issue\u2019\n\nAbiodun Baiyewu, Global Rights Nigeria director, advised the federal government to declare a state of emergency on water bodies in the country.\n\nBayeiwu said Nigeria needs to improve its access to water policy and carry out an audit of the water bodies to ascertain the level of pollution.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to think of this as a national security issue,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, 80 percent of mining is artisanal in nature and more than 90 percent of the law addressed large-scale mining, which means that we are not dealing with the environmental consequences of artisanal mining.\u201d\n\nMayokun Iyaomolere, an environmental officer and founder, Plogging Nigeria Club, said miners in Osun must be compelled to operate within the confines of best environmental practices for the protection of the water bodies.\n\n\u201cIn cases where water pollution arising from mining operations occurs, the parties responsible must be made to carry out necessary remediation efforts to return the water to their baseline state,\u201d he added.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stayed back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account.\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was co-authored by Koromone Koroye, Hannatu Asheloge, and Ngozi Chukwu\n\nAfrica\u2019s technology ecosystem as we know it is thriving and primed for astronomical growth and success in this decade. Over the past 5 years, our ecosystem has celebrated several key milestones:\n\nExits and acquisitions in the millions.\n\nImpressive funding rounds ranging from seed to Series C.\n\nThe arrival of new angel investors and venture funds eager to serve African entrepreneurs.\n\nBusiness and product expansions into multiple regions within Africa.\n\nWhile these milestones are valid and deserve amplification, we cannot ignore the diversity elephant in our meeting rooms, tech conferences, pitch stages, and panel sessions. Funding received by female-owned startups is still significantly low compared to what their male counterparts receive from foreign and local investors. In this widely-read piece by Max Culliver and Africa: The Big Deal, they paint a gloomy picture of existing gender disparities within Africa\u2019s venture funding space. In 2021, 93% of the funding in Africa went to male-led startups \u2013 a pretty shocking figure by any standard.\n\nBut the news isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. This year alone, we\u2019ve seen more African female founders raise capital for their startups and get accepted into reputable accelerators like Techstars Toronto Accelerator (Techstars Toronto) and Y Combinator (YC). This article aims to recognize some African female founders making great strides across various industries and sectors on the continent.\n\nThis list comprises women who are mothers, advocates, readers, dancers, hikers, swimmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and so much more.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "From manufacturing firms to small service companies, businesses are abandoning the national grid to provide their own power, following abysmal levels of power supply and the rising cost of diesel, BusinessDay gathered from conversations with energy companies.\n\nBusinesses are signing contracts with embedded power companies, and smaller ones are turning to off-grid companies to augment supply from the creaking grid as diesel gradually morphs into black gold.\n\n\u201cThe demand for our services has never been this high,\u201d said Chuks Nwani, CEO of Kessington Energy Limited, an energy solutions provider based in Lagos.\n\nNwani said his company had had to sign about 10 power supply contracts with different businesses within the last three months and was still taking orders and answering inquiries from prospective customers.\n\nMultinational specialist in energy distribution Clarke Energy has seen a surge by over 60 percent in demand for new gas plants by manufacturing firms, which now see the prospect of long-term savings from switching to gas.\n\nNathan Odumosu, the company\u2019s marketing manager, told BusinessDay that \u201cdemand for gas plants is now at an all-time high with businesses searching out our companies and requesting talks.\u201d\n\nBusinesses that rely on diesel plants in the face of erratic supply from the grid have been forced to face the familiar reality of poor power supply as diesel prices surged from N300 per litre in January to over N800 per litre in major cities across Nigeria.\n\nThe situation could yet get worse. Oil marketers are warning that the price of diesel could rise above N1,000 per litre in a matter of weeks if nothing is done to curtail the current challenge faced by importers of the product.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in Abuja, Bennett Korie, national president of the Natural Oil and Gas Suppliers Association of Nigeria, said that about 75 percent of filling stations across the country are currently out of business due to their inability to purchase the diesel required to power their tankers and transport Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol, to their various outlets.\n\nHe said that the only solution to the current challenge is for the Federal Government to raise the pump price of petrol a little in order to reduce the huge foreign exchange used in PMS imports.\n\nSmaller businesses though are making the switch to petrol generators, decommissioning their diesel generators on account of diesel prices.\n\nRead also: Nigerian power sector would have collapsed without CBN\u2019s intervention \u2013 Experts\n\nA BusinessDay survey across major generator markets in Lagos revealed a surge in the demand for higher-capacity petrol generators within the last two months when diesel prices went through the roof.\n\nBusinesses from hotels to fast food outlets, even petrol stations, that need constant electricity are switching from diesel-powered generators to cut costs as they see no immediate solution to the soaring cost of diesel and poor grid supply.\n\n\u201cIt is not like as if there has never been a demand for petrol generators, but ever since the high cost of diesel, it has increased by over 70 percent more than usual in my store, especially for those within the range 6 kilovolt-amperes (kVA)-10kVA,\u201d Obijindu Chukwuma, the owner at Chus Best Electronic Worldwide Limited, said.\n\nSimilarly, Bonachristus Izuchukwu, who runs Bonachristub International Limited, said there is a surge in demand for petrol generators, especially from hotels and filling stations.\n\n\u201cIt went up by more than 100 percent in one month.\u201d\n\nHalf of the respondents to BusinessDay\u2019s survey reported over a 100 percent increase in demand for petrol generators.\n\nDiesel prices are deregulated in Nigeria and diesel stocks were already tight globally when Russia invaded Ukraine and the West responded with sanctions that, though not targeting its energy industry, had a crippling effect all the same.\n\nCommodity traders were shunning Russian diesel because of the sanctions as well as payment headaches and transportation challenges as many European ports have banned Russian vessels from docking. These actions have a ripple effect across the world and have affected Nigeria too.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government and 1o state governors are planning to produce 2,000 megawatts (MW) of off-grid electricity through solar power, according to Aliyu Abubakar, minister of power.\n\nThe minister, speaking at the Power Dialogue in Abuja on Wednesday, said Nigeria\u2019s major hydropower plants, Kainji and Jebba, were currently producing only 130MW of electricity to the grid, compared to their joint capacity of about 1,300MW.\n\n\u201cThe policy we have for the off-grid and the mini-grid is in discussion with 14 investors, which are going to give us 1,000MW of solar,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have reached financial and technical level with them during the evaluation. 10 state governors are also planning to produce 1,000MW for 10 states, which is 100MW each.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the ministry is looking at other newer technologies, such as hydrogen technology, which it is still studying and collaborating with those initiating it.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with the hydrogen office set by the German government in Nigeria,\u201d the minister said.",

          "title": "How to lead in a multicultural organisation",
          "text": "Leading any culturally diverse organisation or group requires cultural intelligence. But the problem is increased in large multinational organisations with subsidiaries in many countries. Typically, there are organisational requirements for central control and uniformity to ensure that the organisation remains stable and that subsidiaries work toward a common goal. But major problems emerge when such organisations attempt to manage their diverse communities of people uniformly.\n\nManaging diversity is a positive goal for multinationals, but the means of achieving it need to be locally specific and probably locally devised. In international organisations, a helpful guide for managing diversity is the simple notion of thinking and acting locally.\n\nAlso important in this case is the question, who is the leader?\n\nThere is a difference between formal leadership, that is, with a formally appointed leader who has an appropriate job title and informal leadership, in which someone has leadership status because of the respect of others.\n\nIn multicultural situations, it is probably best not to model your leadership behaviour after a leader in the follower\u2019s culture\n\nMeanwhile, informal leaders arise because their ideas or behaviour are well received by others and because of their good communication skills. Ideally, the formal and informal leaders are the same person. However, a formal leader from another culture may not be accepted in a multicultural situation because of cultural differences, particularly in expected leadership methods. An informal leader from the home culture representing the ideas of local employees may exercise countervailing influence. Formal leaders may therefore have to either exercise a leadership style that fits local expectations or be able to work with the informal leader.\n\nDifferent cultures also have different prototypes of what a leader should be like. A leader who can meet followers\u2019 expectations of a good leader can develop better trust and quality relationships.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is evident that anyone in a group, and not just the formal boss, has the potential to be a leader. In most groups, leadership is at least partially shared. Further, the exercise of leadership implies a duty of followers to follow. Therefore, in multicultural groups and organisations, becoming culturally intelligent is an advantage to the follower as well as to the leader. Being able to read one\u2019s formal leader and colleagues, considering their national culture, is an advantage.\n\nMaking sense of leadership is difficult enough, even without the complication of cultural differences. While there is no universally effective prescription for leading culturally diverse followers, there are some things we can say for sure that culturally intelligent leaders know and do. They are as follows:\n\n1. Leadership is largely in the minds of followers. If followers perceive a person as a leader, they will gain the power, authority, and respect afforded a leader.\n\n2. Followers expect leaders to have\n\ni. a vision for the group or organisation,\n\nii. the ability to communicate this vision clearly and\n\niii. skill in organising followers toward the vision. However, some behaviours indicate that these characteristics differ among cultures.\n\n3. The leadership dimensions of task orientation and relationship exist in every culture, but the behaviours that indicate these orientations are specific to different cultures.\n\n4. Some followers need more leading along each of these dimensions than others. Factors such as organisational norms and the education levels of followers can act as substitutes for leadership. For example, a group of lawyers typically needs very little task orientation from their leader: they already know what to do.\n\n5. Trying to mimic the behaviours of a leader belonging to the followers\u2019 culture may lead to unintended consequences. Some adoption of these behaviours will gain a leader\u2019s acceptance by the followers, but too much may be interpreted as insincere or even offensive.\n\nRead also: Trustworthy leadership\n\n6. In essence, if you want to be a culturally astute leader, you will need to use knowledge and mindfulness to develop a repertoire of behaviours that can be adapted to specific situations. Doing so involves knowledge of the likely expectations of culturally diverse followers based on generalisations from cultural values such as individualism and collectivism. Through mindful observation, you will gradually refine these expectations. You will also need knowledge of your own preferred style of leadership. What balance of task and relationship feels normal to you? Will you work harder to be a relational leader if the situation calls for it?\n\nYou will also need knowledge of the relevant organisational norms. Trying to be a participative leader in a culture that does not value participation can be counter-productive. Here mindfulness includes paying attention to followers\u2019 reactions to particular leadership behaviours and adjusting as necessary.\n\nIn multicultural situations, it is probably best not to model your leadership behaviour after a leader in the follower\u2019s culture. You may look silly trying to behave and sound like Obama, especially if you are not American and may find that follower expectations of indigenous leaders may be very different from their expectations of you. Also, in multicultural groups, followers can have very different expectations. Therefore, a better role model is a leader like you, someone from your own culture, which has been particularly effective with these followers.\n\nThe needs of followers are critical in determining an individual\u2019s perceptions of leadership. A culturally astute leader can find a leadership style that strikes a balance between their typical style, the expectations of followers, and the demands of the situation. This balance may well be imperfect, a work in progress. As with surfing, skiing, or cycling, finding this balance is initially tricky but becomes easier and feels more natural over time.",

We are currently hiring the staff of this school, and are also going to put out an advert for the admission of students for the September session.\n\n\u201cThe demonstration school would be like a laboratory for training basic teachers because what we are trying to do is to make these facilities in Abudu another education hub.\n\n\u201cThe college will help in training teachers, particularly those to teach basic education.

Some vaccines target multiple types of cancer, while others are personalized for individual tumors. However, hope is rising as developing vaccines for tumors are able to dodge the desired immune response via a molecular escape mechanism.\n\nThis week, Medical News Today reported on the development of a new vaccine that is designed to target the immune escape mechanism and leave cancer cells open to attack.\n\nThe vaccine works by preventing the destruction and removal of two stress proteins. This means vaccinated tumor cells remain \u201cvisible\u201d to the immune system, allowing a coordinated immune attack by both T cells and natural killer (NK) cells.\n\nIn the laboratory, the protective effect persisted for at least 4 months in mice. Further trials in rhesus monkeys indicated that the initial vaccine and boosters were safe and effective at providing protective immunity against immune escape.\n\nResearchers plan to begin phase 1 clinical trials next year to test the safety and efficacy of this vaccine against a broad range of cancers in humans. If successful, the vaccine could become an off-the-shelf option for many tumors.\n\nThis week, there\u2019s another cancer research breakthrough, with news of a trial in which all the participants emerged free of colorectal cancer.

I have said it, politics in Nigeria is a case where lunatics have taken over the asylum.\n\n\u201cThis is the only country where the worst is leading. I was a trader and gradually entered into politics. When you take far more than you need, you are sick.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain that one person took N80 billion, it is not greed, it is sickness. When you take one billion that is greed but when you take N80 billion that is sickness.\n\n\u201cMad people have taken over our politics. If we get young people with the competence and capacity to be there, things will change.\u201d\n\nOn the 2023 general elections, Obi said prayers alone could not salvage the country.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians have played their religious roles enough and, therefore, it is time to take action by mobilising and voting for their candidate of choice.\n\n\u201cWe have prayed enough, it is time to act. With these people in power? You can pray from now until anytime, they won\u2019t go until you chase them out. So, it is time to act, not just pray. It is time for us to close the church and deal with these people.\u201d\n\nObi also urged the youths not to make a profession out of politics.",

I am by this letter intimating you of my total withdrawal from all activities at the Ward, Local, State and National levels of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, (PDP).\n\nI am highly honoured and privileged to have been part of a political party that successfully transformed a pariah nation to one that commanded respect in the comity of nations. When we lost the Presidential election in 2015 in bewildered circumstances to say the least, it was my belief that the party would use the opposition period to re-strategize with the aim of taking back power at the earliest opportunity. However, the present situation in the party does not inspire confidence that the party is ready to regain power in 2023. Against the mood of the nation and in complete disregard to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution, the party, threw the zoning of the Presidency open, which created a situation that led to the emergence of a Northerner as the party\u2019s Presidential flagbearer, thus making the two topmost positions in the party, after your emergence as the National Chairman, to be occupied by Northerners, contrary to section 7.3(c) of the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nI salute and commend the Governor of Rivers State, His Excellency, Nyesom Wike for his efforts and gallantry at the primaries. Posterity will be kind to him when the history of the party is written. There are lots to be said, but out of respect for the party, I leave some stories untold at this time.\n\nMy belief in the sanctity of Nigeria is unshaken and will continually work for her progress and development, even if it is through another route.\n\nI thank you sir and I wish you all the best\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nElder Godsday Peter Orubebe,CON",

          "title": "Buhari, Tinubu on Ekiti governorship election: Oyebanji\u2019s victory \u2018ll inspire APC in 2023",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has described the peaceful conduct of the Ekiti state governorship election and the consequent victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a good omen for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe APC candidate, Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji was announced winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) in Ado Ekiti Sunday, beating Chief Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party(SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) to a distant second and third respectively.\n\nOyebanji won the election polling 187,057 votes to defeat Oni, his closest rival, who garnered 82,211 votes, while Kolawole got 67,457.\n\nBuhari speaks\n\nCongratulating the governor-elect in a statement, Sunday, President Buhari said Oyebanji\u2019s victory was well-deserved considering his contributions to the development of the state and the party, before his nomination as the standard bearer.\n\nWhile urging him to be magnanimous in victory in the interest of the people of the state, the president also rejoiced with the APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the National Working Committee (NWC) for the victory, the first under the tenure of the newly elected party executives.\n\n\u201cThis is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe charged all APC members across and outside the country to see this as a good omen for the 2023 general elections and work assiduously to ensure the party\u2019s victory, continuing the trend with Osun state next month July.\n\nThe president also felicitated with the people of Ekiti state for the smooth conduct of the election, affirming that \u201cthey are the real victors as they have been able to freely choose their leader for the next four years.\u201d\n\nHe lauded INEC and the law enforcement agencies for the preparations put in place, urging them to keep the momentum for upcoming elections.\n\nTinubu too\n\nIn a similar message, the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said the feat in Ekiti governorship poll should motivate and inspire APC \u201cas we go for more victories in the coming elections.\u201d\n\nTinubu commended Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion brought into the campaign, which he said paid off with the emphatic and outstanding victory.\n\nTinubu was also full of praise for the party\u2019s governors and the Adamu-led NWC for recording their first major electoral victory, charging them not to relent in their efforts to lead the party to greater victory in 2023 general elections.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate said: \u201cI congratulate our Governor-elect Abiodun Oyebanji and his Deputy, Mrs. Monisade Afuye, for their great success at the election.\n\n\u201cThis victory is our victory as members of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cI salute the people of Ekiti State for voting for progressive leadership and continuity. I commend the leadership of our party for leading APC to this major victory in Ekiti. Also deserving of praise are our party\u2019s governors led by their Chairman and Governor of Kebbi for their hard work and tenacity to achieve victory for the party.\n\n\u201cI must commend the now outgoing-Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his team whose progressive leadership in Ekiti made it possible for APC to retain government for the next four years. I am confident that the Governor will finish well and strong.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking the people of Ekiti once again for standing by APC, I urge them and indeed the generality of Nigerians to continue to maintain their faith and confidence in our party.\u201d\n\nTestimony of our acceptance \u2013 APC\n\nAlso, the APC said the victory clearly symbolised the acceptance of the party, the APC-led federal government and the party\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe party, however, mocked the opposition PDP for finishing a distant third position, saying Nigerians can no longer be deceived by its propaganda against the governing party.\n\nIn a statement by its national publicity secretary, Felix Morka, the APC said: \u201cAs we savour the joy and euphoria of victory in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti state, the All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to congratulate and profoundly appreciate the wonderful people of Ekiti state for reaffirming their confidence in our party by rallying round the Governor-Elect, Biodun Oyebanji.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the well-deserved victory in Ekiti state is an eloquent testimony of the acceptance of our party under the visionary leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the sagacity of our National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of our great Party.\n\n\u201cIt bears mentioning that the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode John Fayemi, provided a solid predicate for this decisive victory. We thank you for your service to your State and Country.\n\n\u201cWe pay a special tribute to the Governor Atiku Bagudu-led Campaign Council for discharging their assignment with extraordinary commitment and efficiency. We salute our dogged Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, our APC Governors, National Secretary, Sen. Iyiola Omisore, among other party leaders, for their highly valued contribution to this success,\u201d the statement said.\n\nOn the PDP\u2019s performance at the poll, Morka said: \u201cUnsurprisingly, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) finished a distant third position in the just-concluded election. Despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission of Nigeria, the people of Ekiti State and, by extension, Nigerians are not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only seeks a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\n\n\u201cAs we inch towards the 2023 general elections, we urge the people of Ekiti state and Nigerians, in general, to sustain their support for our party by voting overwhelmingly for all APC candidates as the party remains unwavering in its commitment to improving the quality of governance and standard of living of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nFayemi, Bagudu excited\n\nSimilarly, Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi and his Kebbi counterpart/Chairman Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Senator Atiku Bagudu, have enjoined the Governor- Elect Oyebanji to accord dividends of democracy a priority, saying he should perceive his victory at the poll as a call to service.\n\nBagudu said: \u201cI know that Oyebanji won\u2019t give Ekiti any course to regret. All we will do is to live up to the expectations of Ekiti people and Nigerians by making Ekiti a cynosure of all eyes and best destination of choice for investors and for people who are looking for a safe haven.\n\n\u201cYour character was rewarded by somebody who trusted in your capacity to serve. There are others that are capable, but he trusts in your capacity and character to step into his shoe.\u201d\n\nThe governors maintained that Oyebanji\u2019s victory buttressed the fact that Ekiti electorate were sophisticated enough to identify and went for the best and most sellable candidate.\n\nThey spoke yesterday in Ikogosi-Ekiti, Oyebanji\u2019s country home in Ekiti West local government area of the state while presenting the election results and declaration sheets to the candidate.\n\nBagudu was the Chairman, APC National Campaign Committee of the party, with Jigawa state Governor, Abubakar Badaru as the campaign Manager for the Ekiti election.\n\nPresenting the documents, Fayemi, described the victory as exciting, applauding President Buhari, the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Tinubu and the PGF for their immense support during the electoral battle.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe worked hard; we planned and pulled all the strings because Ekiti is the precursor for our coming victories in 2023 and Osun States and this is because we have a sellable product. His trajectory has always been to make Ekiti better and this victory will be to the benefit of Ekiti people.\n\n\u201cWith him in the saddle, you may not likely see any abandoned project in our dear state. I really thank Ekiti people for investing this confidence in our party. They have never done it before. Our people believe in turn by turn, but that has changed now.\u201d\n\nFayemi also lauded the INEC for improving on its track records, saying what happened in Ekiti was like a miracle, taking cognisance of the serenity and calmness that pervaded the atmosphere during the election.\n\nGovernor Bagudu, who went down memory lane, revealed that for APC to have won the election with over 100,000 vote margin compared to less than 20,000 recorded in 2018, confirmed how well Fayemi had done in improving the lives of the populace.\n\n\u201cVictory is sweet but we still have to be humble in it. In 2018, Governor Fayemi won the candidate of the PDP with less than 20,000 votes. But this time, the governor-elect beat his nearest rival with over 100,000 votes.\n\n\u201cFour years ago, the major opposition won in four local governments, but that has been narrowed to only a local government.\n\n\u201cThat shows that from 12 local government areas we won in 2018 now APC won 15. This could not have happened if not for the good works done by Governor Fayemi and for the sellable candidate we paraded.\n\n\u201cWe thank the people of Ekiti State for recognising our contributions and for rewarding us with this victory\u201d, Bagudu stated.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate you on your election. Today\u2019s victory is a window to 2023, and the feat our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu may likely achieve. May God give you the wherewithal to be able to deliver for Ekiti citizens\u201d, he said.\n\nOyebanji thanks all\n\nMeanwhile, Governor-Elect Oyebanji has expressed his appreciation to people of the state for the privilege given to him and Deputy Governor-Elect Mrs. Monisade Afuye to serve them.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe recognise that on October 16, 2022 when by the grace of God, we would be inaugurated into office, we are expected to immediately start to build on the legacies of those who came before us, and honourably govern our state in trust for the generations coming after us.\n\n\u201cIt is a duty we campaigned for, and accept with all solemnity and responsibility. In keeping with our covenant with you, we will work Together With You, to Keep Ekiti Working.\n\n\u201cI, together with Chief Mrs. Afuye, use this opportunity to express our gratitude to everyone who voted for us. We also recognise all those who did not vote for us, but whose participation in this important democratic ritual of the election enriched the process, especially with the gracious manner in which you accepted the outcome, and helped maintain the peace during and after the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that though we did not have your vote at this time, we would earn your trust and cooperation as we begin the journey of Keeping Ekiti working,\u201d Oyebanji said.\n\nThe governor-elect also said: \u201cI thank all other aspirants and their respective political parties for the dignified way they carried out their campaigns, and for contributing to the credibility of the process. I will be seeking audience with you all in the coming days, to benefit from your wealth of ideas on how to develop our dear state- to complement our vision and blueprint for the accelerated development of Ekiti. You have all performed creditably and earned places of honour in the history of our state.\n\n\u201cI thank our leaders: our dear president H.E. Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR: the national chairman of our great party the APC: Senator Abdullahi Adamu; as well as our presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for this well-deserved victory for our party you supported us to achieve, and which hopefully signals what to expect in Osun State next month and the general elections next year.\n\n\u201cI thank all members of the National Working Committee of our party; I thank the Progressives Governors Forum, and the Chairman of the Ekiti Gubernatorial Campaign Council, H.E. Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, as well as all members of the council, for graciously supporting us to achieve this crucial victory.\u201d\n\nINEC declares\n\nAnnouncing the result Sunday in Ado Ekiti, INEC\u2019s returning officer, Prof Kayode Adebowale, declared Oyebanji winner, having scored the highest number of votes and won more than two-third of the election in 16 local government areas.\n\nOyebanji won 15 of the 16 local government areas, while Kolawole of the PDP won Efon local government area.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate polled an aggregate of 187, 057 votes to lead Oni of the SDP , who came distant second with 82, 209 votes to emerge second, while Kolawole placed third with 67, 457 votes.\n\nThe breakdown of results declared are as follows: Ekiti South-West LG: APC \u2013 9, 679, PDP \u2013 4,474 and SDP \u2013 4,577, Ekti West LG APC -15, 202, PDP \u2013 3,386 and SDP \u2013 3,863, Efon LG APC \u2013 4012, PDP \u2013 6,303 and SDP \u2013 339; IJERO LG APC \u2013 13,754, PDP \u2013 4897 and SDP \u2013 5006\n\n, IKERE LG APC \u2013 12,086,PDP \u2013 3,789 and SDP \u2013 1,943; Ilejemeje LG APC \u2013 4,357, PDP \u2013 1,157 and SDP \u2013 2,344.\n\nIn Irepodun/Ifelodun LG APC \u2013 13,125, PDP \u2013 4,712 and SDP \u2013 5010, Ise/ Orun LG APC \u2013 8,074, PDP \u2013 2,588 and SDP \u2013 5,909, Moba LG APC \u2013 11,609, PDP \u2013 3530 and SDP \u2013 4904.\n\nOye LG APC \u2013 13396, PDP \u2013 4122 and SDP \u2013 3591, Ado LG APC \u2013 23,831, PDP \u2013 7,575 and SDP \u2013 15,214, Ido/Osi LG APC \u2013 10,321, PDP \u2013 2,871 and SDP \u2013 9,489; , Emure LG APC \u2013 7,728, PDP \u2013 2,610 and SDP \u2013 3,445.\n\nIkole LG APC-16,417, PDP \u2013 6,266 and SDP \u2013 5,736, Gbonyin LG APC -11,247, PDP\u20133,947 and SDP \u2013 4,059 while in Ekiti East LG APC \u201312,099, PDP-5,230and SDP- 4,982.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

          "text": "Peter Obi has called on Nigerians to take back the country, claiming the nation\u2019s political space has been taken over by those he described as \u201clunatics\u201d.\n\nThe presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) believes many of those in the political space do not have business being there.\n\n\u201cSeventy per cent of those who are in politics today should not have any reason to be near there. I have said it before and I will say it again. Politics in Nigeria is a case where lunatics took over the asylum. They must be out.\u201d the former governor of Anambra State said on Sunday\u2019s \u2018Men of Valour\u2019 conference organised by the Revival House of Glory International Church (RHOGIC), Abuja.\n\n\u201cYou must replace that asylum with people who are competent. This is the only country where the worst is leading; the best should lead. I have served there; I am a trader and I started gradually and entered into politics.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, some persons in leadership positions who loot public funds are not greedy but \u201csick\u201d.\n\nAPC Ticket: When I Was Almost Fed Up, I Resorted To Prayers \u2013 Tinubu\n\n\u201cHow do you think about one person taking N80 billion? $200m? That is sickness. It is not greed. The person is greedy. Greed is taking one N1 billion which he is not entitled to but taking N80 billion is sickness. That is a simple truth. And that\u2019s why I said mad people have taken over,\u201d he said in the programme tagged \u2018Navigating the Corridors of Power, the Church, and the Politics\u2019.\n\nAccording to him, more competent people should take over governance as that is the only way to reposition the country just as he accused political parties of having no ideology.\n\nHe, however, believes that \u201cIf we get more young people who have the competence and capacity to be there, they can start developing these things\u201d he said.\n\nObi dismissed claims that his party does not have the structure to challenge the two main parties \u2013 the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cIt is about the people. The people have allowed some group of persons to hijack their country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is why I have said take back your country. It is not theirs. We can\u2019t allow this gangsterism to continue.\u201d\n\nThe presidential candidate recalled that when he was contesting as the governor of Anambra State, there were claims that he had no structure, maintaining that \u201cthe people will decide what they want. Not anybody\u201d.",

          "text": "The mother of Osinachi Nwachukwu has narrated before the FCT High Court in Abuja how the late gospel singer\u2019s husband threatened to kill the late victim.\n\nAppearing before Justice Njideka Nwosu-Iheme on Monday, 61-year-old Caroline Madu, said the accused, Peter Nwachukwu, threatened to kill Osinachi if she (the mother) tried visiting her.\n\nAccording to Madu, 42-year-old Osinachi was last seen in December during a church programme before her death on April 8.\n\nWhen the singer was sick, Madu claimed to have told Osinachi that she needed treatment. She, however, said she would have to plead with her husband, adding that if she visited her, her husband would kill her.\n\nREAD ALSO: Alleged Homicide: Osinachi\u2019s Relatives Present As Husband Arrives Abuja Court\n\nThe singer\u2019s mother, who was in tears, accused Peter of coming to steal her child. Madu said Peter told the family that he was an evangelist. On the contrary, he would beat her child like a carpenter working on a piece of wood.\n\nDuring Osinachi\u2019s pregnancy, the mother said her husband will beat her and when she asked her to come and see him, the singer\u2019s husband refused.\n\nShe added that Peter bragged that if she did not go alive, she will go in death. Madam Madu stated that the situation forced her to send her senior daughter \u2013 Favour Madu \u2013 to go bring Osinachi home. The move was successful as Osinachi stayed a year and three months before Peter sent some pastors to plead with her family to take her back.\n\nAccording to her, Osinachi agreed, telling her family, \u201cWhat God has joined together, no man should put asunder.\u201d\n\nThe late singer was said to have returned to her husband who then resumed the beatings.\n\nWhen she asked Osinachi for monetary assistance, Madu claimed the late singer could not give her as the money was deposited in Peter\u2019s account.\n\nShe further told the court that there was a time she was ill, and people had to plead with Peter to allow her to come over to Abuja for treatment. She recalled going to church with them one day and after the service, Peter drove off with the kids leaving Osinachi and her stranded.\n\nShe added that Osinachi never visited her in Enugu and Peter never allowed her to even pick up her call.\n\nOn Osinachi\u2019s health status, Madu maintained her daughter only told her that she had an ulcer whereas the husband had claimed she died of lung cancer.\n\nUpon hearing about her daughter\u2019s death via radio and television on April 8, the grieving mother said people started coming to her house crying\n\nIn the evening around 7 pm, she said Peter used Osinachi\u2019s number and called her and she asked him how they were, stating that Osinachi was dead\n\nResponding, Madu told the court that she shouted in tears telling him (Peter) that the promise he made that if she didn\u2019t leave alive, she will in death, has finally come to pass. She recalled how she then cut the call and switched off the phone\n\nUnder cross-examination, she said she never knew if Osinachi suffered from another ailment.",

I took up the fight to break this jinx. The battle to secure the APC ticket was hard. When I was almost fed up, I resorted to prayers. I also poured out my mind when I felt there was a gang up against my person. Thank God that I have brought home the presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nThe APC presidential candidate added, \u201cThe task ahead is to galvanise our people to get their voter\u2019s cards and vote to enable us realise this ambition.\n\n\u201cGetting our people to vote is the most important task before all of us. We need to take this message to our people across communities and sensitise them on the need to vote in the general elections.\u201d\n\nAkiolu, in his response, described Tinubu as his \u201cstubborn son\u201d, saying it was time for political leaders in South West to close ranks and work for the victory of Tinubu at the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe stressed that the massive support received by the APC chieftain across the country must be complemented by politicians in the region.\n\n\u201cYour emergence as the presidential candidate of your party is the beginning of another journey in your political career,\u201d the monarch said. \u201cAll Yoruba ancestors shall be with you on this journey to make our fatherland a better place.\u201d\n\nTinubu left the palace to his house on Bourdillon Road in Ikoyi, where some APC governors led by the chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, Atiku Bagudu, were waiting to receive him.\n\nEarlier, all roads leading to the presidential wing of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA) were a beehive of activities as supporters trooped to the airport to receive Tinubu.\n\nTinubu\u2019s arrival in the state is the first since he won the APC presidential ticket.

          "text": "Ukraine\u2019s parliament has voted through two laws that will place severe restrictions on Russian books and music as Kyiv seeks to break many remaining cultural ties between the two countries following Moscow\u2019s invasion.\n\nOne law will forbid the printing of books by Russian citizens, unless they renounce their Russian passport and take Ukrainian citizenship. The ban will only apply to those who held Russian citizenship after the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule.\n\nIt will also ban the commercial import of books printed in Russia, Belarus and occupied Ukrainian territory, while also requiring special permission for the import of books in Russian from any other country.\n\nAnother law will prohibit the playing of music by post-1991 Russian citizens on media and on public transport, while also increasing quotas on Ukrainian-language speech and music content in TV and radio broadcasts.\n\nThe laws need to be signed by president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to take effect, and there is no indication that he opposes either. Both received broad support from across the chamber on Sunday, including from lawmakers who had traditionally been viewed as pro-Kremlin by most of Ukraine\u2019s media and civil society.\n\nUkraine\u2019s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, said he was \u201cglad to welcome\u201d the new restrictions.\n\n\u201cThe laws are designed to help Ukrainian authors share quality content with the widest possible audience, which after the Russian invasion do not accept any Russian creative product on a physical level,\u201d the Ukrainian cabinet\u2019s website quoted him as saying.\n\nThe new rules are the latest chapter in Ukraine\u2019s long path to shedding the legacy of hundreds of years of rule by Moscow.\n\nUkraine says this process, previously referred to as \u201cdecommunisation\u201d but now more often called \u201cderussification\u201d, is necessary to undo centuries of policies aimed at crushing Ukrainian identity.\n\nMoscow disagrees, saying Kyiv\u2019s policies to entrench the Ukrainian language in day-to-day life oppress Ukraine\u2019s large number of Russian speakers, whose rights it claims to be upholding in what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\n\nThis process gained momentum after Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Crimea and support for separatist proxies in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas, but took on new dimensions after the start of the full-scale invasion on 24 February.\n\nHundreds of locations in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, have already been earmarked for renaming to shed their associations with Russia, and a Soviet-era monument celebrating the friendship of the Ukrainian and Russian people was torn down in April, eliciting cheers from the assembled crowd.",

          "text": "The heavyweight title rematch between Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua is now set for Aug. 20 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, it was announced Sunday.\n\nThe fight had been planned for July 23, but now Joshua will have nearly 30 more days to work with new trainer Robert Garcia.\n\nWhen they met in September, Usyk (19-0, 13 KOs) dominated Joshua en route to a unanimous decision victory to capture three heavyweight titles. Joshua, 32, quickly exercised the rematch clause, and neither boxer has competed since.\n\nIn the meantime, Joshua parted ways with Robert McCracken, the only head trainer he\u2019d ever had in the pros. McCracken also led Joshua to a gold medal in 2012 as the head coach of the Great Britain Olympic boxing team.\n\nAnother change for Joshua comes on the broadcast side. The British star has competed exclusively on Sky Sports for the past eight years, but his deal expired after the Usyk bout. Earlier this week, the streaming service DAZN announced that Joshua had signed a long-term deal to fight exclusively on its platform.\n\n\u201cI am entering a new phase in my career with a new training environment, new coaches and now a new broadcaster,\u201d said Joshua, ESPN\u2019s No. 4 heavyweight. \u201cNegotiations at this level take time, so I am pleased to have it all wrapped up and now I can fully focus on giving the fans and DAZN what they want \u2014 knockouts in the glamour division.\u201d\n\nBut it was Usyk, 35, who seemed on the verge of scoring the stoppage in Round 12. The former undisputed cruiserweight champion and fellow Olympic gold medalist lives in Ukraine with his family and was there when Russia invaded in February.\n\nIn March, Usyk decided to leave the war-torn country so he could prepare for the rematch and the first defense of his three titles.",

          "text": "Gustavo Petro, the former mayor of Bogota and ex-rebel fighter, has become Colombia\u2019s first left-wing president.\n\nMr Petro, a current senator, defeated the right-wing construction magnate Rodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez in Sunday\u2019s run-off election.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nFigures show he took 50.5% of votes, defeating his millionaire rival by a close margin of around 700,000 ballots.\n\nThe result marks a major change for the country, which for decades has been led by moderates and conservatives.\n\nThe vote was held amid widespread discontent at the way the country has been run, and there were anti-government protests last year in which dozens of people died.\n\nThe 62-year-old Mr Petro hailed what he called a \u201cvictory for God and for the people\u201d.\n\n\u201cMay so much suffering be cushioned by the joy that today floods the heart of the homeland,\u201d Mr Petro wrote on Twitter. \u201cToday is the day of the streets and squares.\u201d\n\nHis running mate Francia Marquez, a single mother and former housekeeper, will become the country\u2019s first black woman vice-president.\n\nIn a video posted to social media, Mr Hernandez, who ran a non-traditional campaign that relied heavily on TikTok and other social media, conceded to Mr Petro.\n\n\u201cI accept the results of this election,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that Mr Gustavo Petro knows how to run the country and is faithful to his discourse against corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Ivan Duque, who was barred from seeking re-election by Colombia\u2019s term limits, said on Twitter that he had called Mr Petro to congratulate him. He added that they had \u201cagreed to meet in the coming days to initiate a harmonious, institutional and transparent transition\u201d.\n\nMr Petro was a member of the now disbanded M-19 movement in the 1980s. The rebel left-wing group was one of many guerrilla organisations that waged war against the state.\n\nHe spent time in jail for illegal arms possession, before joining the political opposition where he served as both a senator and congressman as well as mayor of Bogota.\n\nMr Petro ran on a radical manifesto and pledged during the campaign to fight inequality by providing free university education, pension reforms and high taxes on unproductive land.\n\nHe also pledged to fully implement a 2016 peace deal that ended a 50-year long conflict with the communist guerrilla group, Farc, and to seek negotiations with the still-active ELN rebels.\n\nAt Gustavo\u2019s results party, the atmosphere is electric. On stage, and in the crowds, people here are dancing salsa \u2013 enjoying every moment of an election like no other.\n\nIn a country that experienced decades of civil conflict, Gustavo Petro\u2019s critics highlighted his role as a former rebel, arguing his economic plans would spell disaster for the country.\n\nBut his promises of inclusion and addressing poverty resonated with this deeply unequal country.\n\nFor Ana Beatriz Acevedo, who represents displaced Afro-Colombian women, the election marks a major change for the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems this country has is inequality \u2013 in black and indigenous communities, among women,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they (Petro and Marquez) represent that difference \u2013 one is mixed race, one is black \u2013 and both believe in inclusion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s often a clich\u00e9 to call elections historic but these really are \u2013 it\u2019s a huge departure for this conservative country and says a lot about how much the country has changed.\n\nNow Colombia will have its first ever leftist leader and alongside him, the first ever black vice-president \u2013 and that speaks volumes about the desire for a different political path.\n\nThe campaign marked Mr Petro\u2019s third run for the presidency. He finished fourth in 2010, and was comfortably defeated in a run-off by Mr Duque in 2018.\n\nWhile some of his proposals have startled investors \u2013 including a planned ban on new oil projects \u2013 many voters said they voted for him to tackle some of Colombia\u2019s intractable problems, such as corruption, widespread poverty and a surge in political violence.\n\nBut Mr Petro will face challenges from a fragmented congress, which includes representatives of more than a dozen parties.\n\n\u201cGiven current levels of polarisation and existing political, economic, social and humanitarian crises, the Petro government will face significant challenges,\u201d Prof Arlene Tickner, an international relations lecturer at Bogota University, told the BBC.\n\n\u201cAn important first step that has already been taken by the president-elect is to initiate efforts to build a broad national coalition in order to enhance his governability.\u201d",

They have a 30-day window to replace them.\n\nBut in a statement, he signed, Atiku said: \u201cThe office of the president in particular requires that the holder of that office must have clarity of the mind on decision-making.\n\n\u201cThat is why in countries that have acquired more experiences in democratic acculturation, the choice that a presidential candidate makes about their running mates, and how they make the decision, provides a window of assessing their preparedness for the job that potentially waits ahead of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Atiku, \u201cIn meeting up with this expectation, and more importantly to ensure that I make a pick of a running mate that you shall be proud of, it became necessary for me to be introspective about my choice.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cGovernor of Delta State, Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa and I share a lot of personality attributes in common. He is a fine gentleman, but tenacious. His experience as a Senator will come in handy in some of the legislative reforms that are urgently needed to reformat our governmental processes.\n\n\u201cIfeanyi and I are incurable optimists in the future of Nigeria and the promises it holds as one united, peaceful and prosperous country.\n\n\u201cHaving him on the ticket brings a lot of asset to our campaign. In the months ahead to the general election, together with other great leaders of our party, the Peoples Democratic Party and, with your esteemed support, we shall work very hard to ensure convincing victory for our party.\n\n\u201cA victory for the PDP in the general election is a victory for Nigeria.

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the Ekiti State governor-elect and All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, on his victory at Saturday\u2019s governorship poll in the state. Buhari, however, advised Oyebanji to be magnanimous in victory, in a release on Sunday by the president\u2019s media adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\nThe president said the APC candidate\u2019s victory was well-deserved, considering his contributions to the development of the state and the party before his nomination, but it was also an indication of the people\u2019s confidence in the ruling party.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at his Ikogosi-Ekiti country home, Oyebanji assured that he would not disappoint the people.\n\nThe assurance came as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the governorship election, Olabisi Kolawole, congratulated the winner, describing his victory as a popular choice to which he convincingly conceded defeat.\n\nMany prominent Nigerians hailed APC and its candidate over their victory at the poll. They included National Chairman of APC, Abdulahi Adamu; presidential candidate of the party, Bola Tinubu; President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; outgoing governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo.\n\nWhile urging Oyebanji to be benevolent in victory in the interest of the people, Buhari also rejoiced with Adamu and the APC National Working Committee (NWC) for a successful outing, the first in the tenure of the newly elected executives of the party.\n\nThe president told the APC national chairman, \u201cThis is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all.\u201d\n\nBuhari charged all APC members within and outside the country to see the victory in Ekiti State as a good omen for the 2023 general election and work diligently to ensure the party\u2019s success. He urged a continuation of the winning trend in the Osun State governorship poll in July.\n\nFelicitating with the people of Ekiti State for the smooth conduct of the election, Buhari affirmed that they were the real victors, as they were able to freely choose their leader for the next four years.\n\nHe also lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the law enforcement agencies for their conducts, and urged them to keep the momentum in future elections.\n\nOn his part, Oyebanji promised never to disappoint or betray the confidence reposed in him by Ekiti people. He said his victory marked a watershed in the history of the state, saying it would translate into prosperity and growth, as he builds and improves on the legacies of the previous administrations.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate polled an aggregate of 187, 057 votes to defeat Chief Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), who came a distant second with 82, 209 votes, while Kolawole of PDP scored 67, 457 votes to place third.\n\nOyebanji lauded the electorate in the state for the overwhelming confidence in him, and assured that he would hit the ground running with his agenda for growth and turnaround of the state.\n\nHe commended INEC and the security agencies for delivering to Ekiti State a free, fair and credible poll, in line with the decision of the majority of people in the state.\n\nCommending the other contestants in the election for adding credibility to the contest with their noble and enviable conducts, Oyebanji stated that before his inauguration on October 16, he would be meeting them to source ideas towards the development of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI thank all other aspirants and their respective political parties for the dignified way they carried out their campaigns, and for contributing to the credibility of the process.\n\n\u201cI will be seeking audience with you all in the coming days, to benefit from your wealth of ideas on how to develop our dear state \u2013 to complement our vision and blueprint for the accelerated development of Ekiti. You have all performed creditably and earned places of honour in the history of our state.\u201d\n\nOn those who lost their lives in some of the isolated violent incidents during the electioneering period, Oyebanji said, \u201cI use this opportunity to once again convey my condolences to the families of our kinsmen, who died in the pockets of pre-election violence. I join my voice with that of all well-meaning Ekiti kete to the call for full investigations into the incidences and ensure justice is done.\u201d\n\nKolawole: Your Victory is Popular Choice\n\nThe candidate of PDP in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Otunba Olabisi Kolawole, congratulated the APC candidate and winner of the election, Mr Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is a popular choice.\n\nIn a congratulatory letter he personally signed, Kolawole said, \u201cFollowing the announcement of your victory in the June 18 Ekiti governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), I hereby write to congratulate you accordingly.\n\n\u201cI believe that power belongs to God and He bestows upon whoever he chooses. I also believe in popular choice that the unfettered expression of the peoples mandate as one of the crucial hallmarks of democratic principle and practice.\n\n\u201cDemocracy must, therefore, deliver to the people dividends of security or protection and enhance their social welfare and well-being basically, among other deliverables.\n\n\u201cThese were the motivation for my own ambition in the governorship of Ekiti State, which I feel strongly to reiterate here in view of the precarious situation of our people at the moment.\n\n\u201cPlease, take urgent actions aimed at redressing the plights of our people when you fully assume the mantle shortly. Finally, I wish you the guidance of the Almighty God in the onerous task ahead.\u201d\n\nAdamu: Ekiti Victory is Precursor of Future APC Victories\n\nNational Chairman of APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Sunday, said the victory recorded in the Ekiti State governorship election by the party was a foretaste of expected victories in future polls. Adamu stated this in his letter of congratulations to the governor-elect, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, signed by the senate president\u2019s Senior Special Assistant (SSA), Dr Samuel Jimba.\n\nAdamu said the victory recorded in the first election in his tenure as national chairman of APC was as a result of the popularity of Oyebanji\u2019s candidature, as well as the robust campaign strategy put in place by the party.\n\nHe paid tribute to the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, who, as leader of APC, provided guidance for the party as it went into the Ekiti election.\n\nThe senate president promised Buhari that the party would continue to be guided by wisdom in all future elections for the consolidation of his legacies.\n\nTinubu: Ekiti Victory Will Motivate APC for More in 2023\n\nPresidential candidate of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the party\u2019s victory in the Ekiti State governorship election would spur it on to more victories in the coming elections. In a statement yesterday by his media office, Tinubu congratulated Oyebanji and the party for winning the governorship election. He also commended the APC governors and members of the NWC under Adamu\u2019s leadership for recording their first major electoral victory. He charged them not to relent in their efforts, but to lead the party to greater victories in the 2023 general election.\n\nCommending Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion he brought to the campaign, Tinubu said, \u201cI congratulate our governor-elect Abiodun Oyebanji and his deputy, Mrs. Monisade Afuye, for their great success at the election. This victory is our victory as members of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cThis feat should motivate and inspire us as we go for more victories in the coming elections. I must commend the now outgoing governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his team, whose progressive leadership in Ekiti made it possible for APC to retain government for the next four years. I am confident that the governor will finish well and strong.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking the people of Ekiti once again for standing by APC, I urge them and, indeed, the generality of Nigerians to continue to maintain their faith and confidence in our party.\u201d\n\nFayemi: Ekiti People Have Spoken Loud and Clear\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, congratulated the leadership of APC on the victory, and also lauded the Ekiti electorate, whom he said spoke loud and clear through the ballot box.\n\nIn a message of congratulations in Ado-Ekiti, Fayemi described Oyebanji\u2019s victory as well-deserved, saying it is a befitting honour for a man, who, in the last three decades, has committed his time, energy, talent and resources to the development of the state.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cEkiti people have spoken loud and clear. The outcome of the election has shown that Ekiti people are honourable people, who always support and reward leaders, who have served them diligently and faithfully.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the new governor-elect will serve Ekiti people even more diligently, and create opportunities for other young people.\n\n\u201cHearty congratulations to our own BAO, the governor-elect, and a bigger congratulations to our party, APC. The biggest accolade goes to the good people of Ekiti State for their display of civility throughout the electioneering period.\u201d\n\nAdebayo: Ekiti Has Shown the World Maturity of Nigeria\u2019s Democracy\n\nMinister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, congratulated the winner of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, saying by the peaceful conduct of the people, they have shown the world that democracy has matured in the country.\n\nAdebayo said the outcome of the election was the people\u2019s verdict on APC\u2019s performance in the last three and a half years, which put the state on the path of steady progress and development\n\nThe former governor of the state praised other contestants in the election for abiding by the rules of the game and allowing Ekiti people to make their decision on who should be their next governor. He called on them to accept the outcome of the election and team up with Oyebanji to continue the good work of the incumbent governor.\n\nSanwo-Olu: Oyebanji\u2019s Victory Testifies to APC\u2019s Good Works\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, congratulated Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is a testament to the good work the APC government in the state as well as the sterling qualities of its candidates.\n\nSanwo-Olu also congratulated he APC leadership at the federal and state levels, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile.\n\nThe governor said he did not doubt the party\u2019s victory because Ekiti people were progressives and would always vote for the party. He said the progressive nature of the Ekiti people as well as their culture of reciprocating good gestures were what played in Oyebanji\u2019s victory.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cI must note that our party, the All Progressives Congress, and its government under the able leadership of Governor Kayode Fayemi has delivered beyond the expectations of the Ekiti people. I, therefore, believe it was only natural for the citizens to reciprocate by voting for our party.\n\n\u201cOur confidence was further buoyed by the quality of candidates presented for the governorship poll. The combination of Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji and his deputy, Mrs Monisade Christiana Afuye, is what Ekiti needs to continue with the great work started by the outgoing governor.\n\n\u201cI once again congratulate the winners for running a good race and emerging victorious. I also congratulate my brother-governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who has set a winning template for the party, with good governance over the years.\u201d\n\nLawan: Ekiti is Indicative of 2023 General Election\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, while congratulating the APC candidate in the Ekiti governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, said the outcome of the exercise was indicative of what to expect in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ola Awoniyi, Lawan also congratulated APC, both at the state and national levels, and the people of Ekiti State on the peaceful and successful conduct of the poll, and for making the right choice. He said the outcome of the election further demonstrated the trust and confidence of Nigerians across the country in APC.\n\nLawan said democracy had continued to get stronger in Nigeria under the APC federal government led by President Muhammadu Buhari. He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for delivering a poll that had been widely adjudged as free, fair, transparent and hitch-free, and wished the governor-elect God\u2019s guidance as he prepared for the onerous task ahead.\n\nAPC: Fayemi\u2019s Achievements Laid Foundation for Our Victory\n\nThe APC leadership has said the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, provided a solid foundation for the decisive victory of the party in the just concluded governorship election in the state.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, in a statement, said without a doubt, the well-deserved victory in Ekiti State was an eloquent testimony to the acceptance of the party under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the sagacity of Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of members of the NWC.\n\nAPC said, not surprisingly, the opposition PDP came a distant third position in the election, despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission in Nigeria. It stressed that the people of Ekiti State and, by extension, Nigerians were not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only sought a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\n\nAPC stated, \u201cAs we savour the joy and euphoria of victory in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti State, the All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to congratulate and profoundly appreciate the wonderful people of Ekiti State for reaffirming their confidence in our party by rallying round the governor-elect, Biodun Oyebanji.\n\n\u201cIt bears mentioning that the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode John Fayemi, provided a solid predicate for this decisive victory. We thank you for your service to your state and country.\u201d\n\nAPC urged the people of Ekiti State and Nigerians, in general, to sustain their support for the party by voting overwhelmingly for all APC candidates in subsequent elections.\n\nAkeredolu: BAO, APC Victory Symbolic\n\nChairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), congratulated the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and winner of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, saying his victory is symbolic.\n\nAkeredolu also saluted the people of the state for the smooth conduct of the exercise.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the governor described the victory as an unequivocal testament to the acceptability of APC and the excellent performance of the incumbent, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cI congratulate my brother, Biodun Oyebanji Abayomi, on this victory. I rejoice with our great party, the APC. I salute the people of Ekiti for their resilience and peaceful conduct. This victory is for the people of Ekiti State and all lovers of democracy across the country. It is a mark of renewed commitment of the people to our party, the APC.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, BAO\u2019s vast experience in public service is an asset that would be deployed for the good of the people of Ekiti State. As a former commissioner, Chief of Staff, and later Secretary to the State Government, the governor-elect is well equipped to take the state to the next level.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that BAO will consolidate on the gains of the outgoing administration of Governor Fayemi and leverage on the continuity of our party in government to further deliver dividends of good governance to the people.\n\n\u201cThis is our first win since the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the presidential candidate of our party. This election is, however, symbolic as it shows the preparedness and commitment of our people to vote en masse for the APC in next year\u2019s general election.\u201d\n\nHouse Lauds INEC over Ekiti Governorship Election\n\nThe House of Representatives lauded INEC for the successful conduct of the governorship election in Ekiti State, which has been adjudged a triumph for democracy, according to metrics by independent domestic and foreign observers.\n\nThe lawmakers, in a statement by their spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, also commended the Nigeria Police, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and other security agencies for keeping the peace and demonstrating vigilance against electoral malpractices.\n\nWhile assuring of their commitment to the improvement of the electoral processes, the House expressed optimism that the successful run of the election in Ekiti would inspire more Nigerians to vote in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAs the first gubernatorial election to be conducted by INEC under the new Electoral Act 2022, the election presented a unique opportunity to assess the operational implications of some provisions of the newly issued INEC guidelines and the Electoral Act 2022, which was recently passed by the National Assembly under the leadership of the distinguished Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, and the Honourable Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports from independent election observers, there was marked improvement in election logistics management, as well as the deployment of personnel and essential materials, such as the Voter Register, Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), voting cubicles, and ballot boxes, which resulted in early commencement of voting.\n\n\u201cThe House is also pleased with reports that the BVAS functioned properly in 94% of observed polling units, and was promptly fixed in the 6% of polling units where it malfunctioned. This, indeed, validates the faith that was placed in INEC to deploy election technology to improve our electoral system.\n\n\u201cThe House also seizes this opportunity to call on INEC to extend the June 30th voter registration deadline to accommodate the increasing number of Nigerians who wish to register to vote.\u201d\n\nIG Hails Ekiti Electorate, as PSC Salutes Police Performance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr Usman Baba commended the electorate in Ekiti State for cooperating with the Nigeria Police and other security agencies in the governorship election.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Police Service Commission (PSC), which supervised the police officers deployed during the poll, confirmed that the election was largely peaceful and orderly and commended its men.\n\nThe IG also lauded the efforts of the police officers deployed for the poll, under the direct supervision of Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of election security, DIG Johnson Babatunde Kokumo.\n\nThe IG noted that the police officers conducted themselves professionally, which built trust with the electorate and, ultimately, led to a successful electoral process.\n\nA statement last night by the Force Headquarters said the IG emphasised that the timely situation reports released by the police effectively covered all communication gaps with the people and eliminated every iota of doubt regarding the massive security presence in the state.\n\nThe police chief, while admonishing Nigerians to toe the line of peaceful conduct in forthcoming elections, assured all citizens of improved management of security during electioneering processes. He called on well meaning Nigerians, particularly, the electorate and political actors, to accord necessary support to the police and other security agencies in the 2023 general election, and in the Osun State\u2019s off-season governorship election, slated for July.\n\nThe PSC, in a statement by its head of Press and Public Relations, Mr Ikechukwu Ani, affirmed that the Ekiti election was a huge improvement and good test-run for the 2023 elections.\n\nSERAP Urges INEC to Prosecute Vote Buyers or Face Legal Action\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) gave the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, seven days to gather information about reports of vote-buying, undue influence, intimidation, ballot box snatching, and other electoral offences by the three leading political parties in the just concluded governorship election in Ekiti State.\n\nSERAP also urged INEC to promptly and effectively prosecute those arrested, and bring to justice anyone who sponsored, aided and abetted them.\n\nIn a letter dated June 18, 2022 and signed by SERAP\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said corruption of the ballot box intruded on the freedom of Nigerian voters to make up their minds and vote buying and other forms of electoral corruption froze out the less wealthy candidates and parties.\n\nSERAP said if voting was as important as INEC always claimed, now was the time to end the buying of democracy by wealthy politicians and their sponsors.\n\nThe letter read, in part, \u201cVote buying encourages poor governance and weakens citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their \u2018elected officials\u2019 accountable for their actions. When political candidates or their sponsors decide to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidates and sponsors will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\n\n\u201cThere are reports of a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery in several polling units during the just concluded Ekiti governorship election. There are reports of bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings and bags of foodstuff being shared after votes have been cast.\n\n\u201cActing swiftly to address the brazen impunity and reports of vote-buying and electoral bribery and other electoral offences during the Ekiti State governorship election would also send a strong message to politicians that INEC, under your watch, would not tolerate such practices during the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cProsecuting allegations of vote-buying, undue influence, ballot snatching, intimidation, and other electoral malpractices during the Ekiti State governorship election would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the country\u2019s international human rights anti-corruption obligations.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within within days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\nSituation Room Affirms Vote Buying Rampant in Ekiti Poll\n\nThe Situation Room, a civil society coalition, said it observed the incidence of vote buying and selling going on unabated during the election in Ekiti State.\n\nIn a statement issued by Convener of the Situation Room, Eneh Obi, the group said vote buying during the Ekiti election followed a familiar pattern of similar across the country, and in particular, the 2014 governorship election in the state.\n\nObi stated, \u201cThe description of this phenomenon as \u2018stomach Infrastructure\u2019 in the 2014 election has evolved into a new nomenclature now described as \u2018See and Buy\u2019. The ability of Ekiti politicians to make light of such a grave violation of extant law is most unfortunate. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Situation Room said the election was generally peaceful, with voters playing a key part in the peaceful election environment and commended voters for their comportment at the various polling centres.\n\nIt noted that INEC\u2019s strategy of voters\u2019 redistribution failed to address the problem of over concentration of voters in some polling units.\n\nAccording to the election monitoring group, a glaring example was the situation at Surajudeen School, Ado Dallimore (Ward 9), Ado Ekiti LGA, which had about five thousand registered voters shared between just two polling units.\n\nIt said some of the voters complained that their request for transfer of registration to their preferred polling units was not approved before this exercise.",
