          "text": ".\n\nThe Federal Government has raised alarm over the use of what it called \u201cdeep\u201d fake news to attack it and its officials.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, raised the alarm in an interview with the NAN on Saturday, in Sal Island, Cape Verde.\n\nReports have it that the minister was in Sal Island for the 64th Conference of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) \u2013 Conference for Africa and the second edition of UNWTO Global Tourism Investment Forum.\n\nMohammed said fake news had worsened by becoming a weapon for naysayers to attack the government and its officials.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, Nigerians should know that we have graduated from ordinary fake news to \u201ddeep\u201d fake news. The danger of deep fake news is that it is difficult to differentiate fake news from real news.\n\n\u201cThis is because purveyors of deep fake news would take a story, be it a video or a photograph and make it look real.\n\n\u201cThey will take videos of what is happening in other lands, doctor them and freely circulate them as what is really happening in Nigeria. Ditto photographs.\n\n\u201cNews stories are even worse because they embellish such fake stories with quotes and videos and even quote government officials as if they are real.\n\n\u201cThis becomes more difficult for unsuspecting Nigerians to know the difference between fake news and real information,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister noted that at the beginning, purveyors of deep fake news were largely unknown online publications, adding that it was, however, unfortunate that otherwise reputable publications and some mainstream media had joined the bandwagon.\n\nGiving instances of deep fake news, the minister recalled the aftermath of the interview by Channels Television of Benue Governor, Samuel Ortom and a retired Navy Commodore, Kunle Olawunmi.\n\n\u201cAfter the interview, online and traditional newspapers were awash with stories that the station had been shut, while some said that the anchor people had been arrested.\n\nSome even went to demonstrate the purported arrest of the anchor people, but till today, the station is still open.\n\n\u201cThese people have no shame because they know from the beginning that they are telling deep fake news, they have no credibility and can destroy anybody at will with their weapon,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister also recalled his recent official trip to Washington to engage with think tanks and global media outfits, during which a particular online publication twisted the purpose of the trip, claiming that he went with his aide to beg Twitter and Twitter shunned them.\n\nThe minister said the fake news was made deep by the online publication by quoting the airline they travelled on, their seat number and even video clips showing them in the aircraft.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of deep fake news because any unsuspecting Nigerians will believe it is true. Of course, they knew they were telling lies because our itinerary and programmes in the US were not hidden, but reported daily by social media, radio, newspapers and television.\n\n\u201cEven that same online newspaper carried stories of our engagements, yet it kept saying we went to the US to beg Twitter and we were shunned,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed said the same online publication also went ahead to publish deep fake news about a US trip by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nHe said with a deliberate intention to tarnish and destroy the government, the online publication claimed that Gambari and other officials were going to the US to infiltrate the ranks of agitators planning a protest against the President, who would be attending the United Nations, General Assembly.\n\n\u201cWhen the Statistician-General of the Federation, Dr Yemi Kale retired some weeks ago, there was a story credited to him that while in office, he was coerced by government to falsify figures about the economic growth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOf course, Kale came out to refute the story, but the purveyors knew what they were doing.\n\n\u201cThe deep fake news was fabricated just to take the shine away from the government\u2019s success in not only retaining positive GDP growth but surpassing all expectations crawling from 0.11 per cent two quarters ago to marginal .51 per cent in the last quarter and then 5.0 per cent.\n\n\u201cOf course, they don\u2019t wish the government and Nigeria well, but needed something to dampen the enthusiasm of government and make Nigerians sad,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister said they foresaw the danger of fake news since 2017 when the federal government launched a campaign against it.\n\nHe reiterated the resolve of the federal government to regulate social media, which had become a major tool for propagating fake news.\n\n\u201cAnytime the fake news purveyors strike, they strengthen our resolve further to act on sanitising the social media. By their conduct, they are showing the world that we are ripe in our pursuit of sanitising the social media,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nManufacturers Association of Nigeria, on Thursday, 2nd September 2021, hosted a high-level roundtable themed, Positioning African Industries for Economic Transformation and Continental Free Trade.\n\nThe conversation, which centred around an advancement in Africa, suggested practical ways to create ease of doing business in the continent. Driven by industry experts, the panel discussions were nothing short of first-hand experiences and reliable solutions from some of Africa\u2019s foremost business magnates.\n\nIn his opening remark, Engineer Mansur Ahmed, President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, admitted that the conversation on African industrialization will be decidedly inconclusive without consideration of Africa\u2019s economic relations with China, the nation which is inevitably set to become the leading industrial nation in the world.\n\nWith 250 attendees onsite at Oriental Hotel, Lekki, Lagos, and thousands joining the conversation digitally, there is no doubt that the event initiated new ways of looking at industrialization best-suited for the Africa of tomorrow as captured in the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063.\n\nThe Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, testified that \u201cMAN, has, over the years, been faithful to its mission of working with other organs of the organized private sector, government, and other stakeholders in the economy to create an enabling environment for industrial development, growth, and prosperity.\u201d\n\nWhile stating the importance of the theme for the roundtable, the Vice President implored governments and the private sector to pay close attention to positioning African industries for economic transformation and continental free trade. He further said that manufacturing is key to economic transformation, and has the potential of providing sustainable jobs. He encouraged African countries to make industrialization a key priority.\n\nOtunba Niyi Adebayo, the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment, speaking after the Vice President, lamented Africa\u2019s position at the bottom of the global value chain. He went on to discuss the implication of this, commenting on the low processing of raw materials in the continent. In his words, \u201cTo unleash our full potential, African countries must embark on an audacious agenda, preferably driven by private sector-led investments to ensure the economic transformation of the continent, specifically through industrialization.\n\nThe panel session, led by Mr Doyin Salami, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria, and former member of the Federal Government\u2019s Economic Management Team, had as its first panelist, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, President, Dangote Group. When asked about Africa\u2019s competitive edge in industrialization across the world, Alhaji Dangote stated quite frankly the need to produce high quality products at the most affordable cost.\n\nHe referred to the Asian market which concentrated on its domestic products and pricing. Alhaji Dangote went on to advise the managers of African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to speed up implementation, and particularly make doing business easier in Africa, in order to be competitive. He also lamented the bottlenecks at the border, exorbitant port charges, and restricted access within Africa.\n\nIn furtherance of the panel conversation, H.E. Albert Muchanga, the Commissioner for Economic Development, Trade, Industry and Mining for the AU; Mr Amr Kamel, the Vice President of Afreximbank; Mr Wamkele Mene, the Secretary General of the AfCFTA; Engnr Mansur Ahmed, the President of MAN and Chairman of the Pan-African Manufacturers Association; Chief Diana Chen, Vice Chair of the China-Africa Business Council; among others, had conversations around challenges that African manufacturers face, the roles of the AfCFTA in dealing with these hindrances, among other pertinent issues that border around the theme of the event.\n\nChief Diana Chen, the Chairman of CIG Motors, authorized distributor of GAC Motor in Africa, while speaking during the panel discussion, addressed the difficulty of doing business in Africa, proffered solutions, as well as encouraged Chinese business moguls to invest more in Nigeria. She highlighted China\u2019s interest in speeding up manufacturing in Africa, and her willingness to improve digital technology in the continent.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, represented by the Senate Committee Chairman on industry, Senator Saidu Alkali, expressed his delight for the theme of the roundtable discussion, and went on to say that achieving growth in the area of industrialization is critical to job creation, well-being of the people, and reduction in social and political tension.\n\nThe Vice President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Chief John Aluya, during his vote of thanks, relayed the association\u2019s gratitude for the participation, and his delight in the outstanding success of the roundtable.\n\nHe also revealed that the conversation from the roundtable will help in building a stronger, inclusive, and sustainable economy in Africa. He thanked the panelists for their impact, and specially showed appreciation to Chief Diana Chen, who he described as a Nigerian by heart, for her immense contributions.",
          "summary": "Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, on Thursday, 2nd September 2021, hosted a high-level roundtable themed, Positioning African Industries for Economic Transformation and Continental Free Trade.\nThe conversation, which centred around an advancement in Africa, suggested practical ways to create ease of doing business in the continent.\nDriven by industry experts, the panel discussions were nothing short of first-hand experiences and reliable solutions from some of Africa\u2019s foremost business magnates.\nOtunba Niyi Adebayo, the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment, speaking after the Vice President, lamented Africa\u2019s position at the bottom of the global value chain.\nHe also revealed that the conversation from the roundtable will help in building a stronger, inclusive, and sustainable economy in Africa.",

          "text": "A Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Chima Nweze has said that if the constitutional provisions dealing with disqualification for elective offices are properly utilised, the number of hoodlums vying for political offices in Nigeria will reduce,\n\nJustice Nweze stated this during the inaugural ceremony of Old Seminarians Association of Nigeria (OSAN) at the weekend in Abuja.\n\nNweze while delivering a keynote address titled, \u2018Age Quod Agis: the Route to National Cohesion and Integration\u2019 said the constitutional provision had already exposed sundry miscreants vying for political offices but noted that enforcement was lacking.\n\nHe said Priests and other Christian organizations must stand up to the task of appointing credible leaders worthy of emulation in political offices.\n\nAccording to Justice Nweze, Christians must no longer remain aloof and indifferent to corrupt leadership which have inflicted so much pain on the people and divided the people along ethnic, religious, political and ideological lines.\n\nHe said \u201cthe division came had come with serious suspicion, distrust, and hatred among the diverse citizens\u201d\n\nNweze noted that efforts towards national integration as a national interest and project in Nigeria was challenged by corruption, baseless party politics and insecurity, warning that citizens needed to think beyond primordia interests.\n\nInstead, what was required of the citizens, was to think beyond those differences and focus on things that could propel the nation into maximising its potentials towards greatness.\n\nHe noted that without love encapsulated in good neighbourliness being imbibed by the citizens, the different components that made up the country would persist as dividing factors.\n\nHe also called on the Nigerian Church to espouse \u201cthe evangelisation of human structures\u201d. which according to him, refers to a new approach to confront the injustices ravaging the economic, social and political lives of the people.\n\n\u201cThe question now is: how can the Nigerian Church achieve this without embarking on political activism.\n\n\u201d As we noted elsewhere, political philosophers have identified corrupt political leadership as the ultimate albatross of political life in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Association (OSAN) Chinedu Akubueze while congratulating members at the inaugural ceremony, admonished the Old Seminarians to continue to use their God-given gifts to affect lives positively and contribute their quota to national development, especially in the political scene.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe are going to harness the potentials from this varied and various Nigerians from diverse parts of the country who are Catholics and who are old seminarians to attempt at making some impact in the scenario that is presently playing out in the Nigerian Political and Social sphere\u201d.\n\nOn his part, human rights lawyer, Femi Falana said the security challenges facing the country had shown that the federal government lacked the capacity to police the country.\n\nThe human rights lawyer said he supports state and local government policing, saying that that was the way to go.\n\nHe noted that the country needed 500,000 police personnel to police the country effectively, whereas Nigeria has less than a million police personnel to man the security of citizens.",

In total, Adams made 22 appearances for France.\n\nAdams and his wife Bernadette were married in April 1969 and had two sons, Laurent (born 1969) and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric (1976).\n\nFollowing a ligament rupture injury, he was hospitalised for surgery on March 17, 1982 at the \u00c9douard Herriot Hospital in Lyon. After an error made by his anesthesiologist, he suffered a bronchospasm which starved his brain of oxygen and he slipped into a coma. But his wife, Bernadette remained and continued caring for him after refusing to opt for euthanasia.\n\nJean-Pierre Adams eventually died at 73, almost 40 years after falling into a coma.",

But photos soon emerged of the president in Military custody.\n\nHere are eight things to know about the Coup in Guinea:\n\n*Col. Doumbouya, a 41-year-old former member of the French legionary, appeared on State television Sunday to announce that the government and constitution had been dissolved and a new government would be formed soon, though he did not provide a timeline. He said he led the coup to end the president's corrupt administration, which had failed to bring economic prosperity to the country. \"We will no longer entrust politics to one man. We will entrust it to the people,\" Doumbouya said.\n\n*In a viral video on Sunday, 83-year-old Alpha Conde, was seen in custody of men in military uniforms.\n\n*After the coup, many citizens took to the streets to celebrate Conde's removal from power, running and cheering alongside passing military vehicles.\n\n*Col. Doumbouya on Monday ordered ministers from the ousted government to a meeting and warned that failure to attend would be considered an act of rebellion.\n\n*At the meeting, he ordered ministers from the ousted government not to depart the country and to hand over their official vehicles.\n\n*Col. Mamady Doumbouya also encouraged companies that conduct mining in Guinea to continue their work, exempting them from a nationwide curfew.\n\n*He said there would not be a witch-hunt against former officials.\n\n*U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres tweeted that he was \"personally following the situation in Guinea very closely,\" and called for the military to release the deposed president.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has lamented the spate of conflicting judgments emanating from courts of coordinate jurisdiction and unending political parties leadership crises, saying they make the exercise of its responsibilities difficult.\n\nThe electoral umpire said it was even more frustrating and disconcerting that the more it tried to improve the credibility and transparency of electoral process, the more extraneous obstacles were put on its path through litigations.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at the third quarterly meeting with political parties in Abuja yesterday warning political parties to play by the rules as the commission would not fail to exercise its umpire and regulator roles on them.\n\n\u201cI am aware that some of the cases are still in court and therefore sub-judice. I must say that some of the decided cases are making our work difficult and we have been crying out loud for a long time. In particular, some pre-election litigations relating to the nomination of candidates for elections were not determined until after the elections. Consequently, in some instances, political parties were declared winners without candidates to immediately receive the Certificates of Return on account of protracted and conflicting litigations or where courts rather than votes determine winners of elections.\n\n\u201cThis situation is compounded by cases on the leadership of political parties, thereby making the exercise of our regulatory responsibilities difficult. It appears that in a number of electoral cases in Nigeria today, the settled law is now unsettled and the time-honoured principle of stare decisis does not seem to matter any longer.\n\n\u201cHowever, the commission appreciates the recent statement by the Chief Justice of Nigeria as well as the strongly worded concern by the Nigerian Bar Association. We will work with both the Bar and Bench to defend the electoral process in the best interest of our democracy.\n\nYakubu said though INEC was at a \u201ccrossroad at the moment\u201d in the deployment of technology, it would however test run its Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), a new electoral technology that performs the functions of both Smart Card Reader (SCR) and Z-Pad, during the weekend\u2019s bye-election in Delta State and the November 6 Anambra State governorship election.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that the new machine is robust enough to further guarantee the credibility of voter authentication and transparent management of results during elections.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "The immediate past senator representing Akwa Ibom South otherwise called Eket Senatorial District, Sen Nelson Efiong has once again been kidnapped.\n\nSen Efiong was kidnapped by 9 pm.on Sunday at his newly opened highbrow club along Oron Road, Uyo.\n\nThis is the second time that Efiong has been kidnapped having earlier been kidnapped in 2009, two years after leaving the seat as the third speaker of Akwa Ibom state house of assembly in 2007 in the current democratic dispensation.\n\nHis former aide who craved anonymity confirmed to Daily Sun that Efiong had to cough out the sum of N21 million as ransom before he was released by his abductors.\n\nHis latest kidnap problem said to have been carried out by three armed hoodlums was said to have led to several.persons sustaining injuries either from stray bullets fired by the kidnappers or from stampede from the panick the hoodlums had caused in the process of whisking him away.\n\nOne Ekwere, (other names withheld) was said to have been one of those hit by a stray bullet in the process as he was said to have screamed on his social media pages: \u201cI have just been shot; I have been shot along Oron Road\u201d, while urging security agencies to rescue the situation.\n\nEfiong, the first senator to defect from PDP to APC in Akwa Ibom in 2018 to pave way for Sen Godswill Akpabio to also defect, appears to have always been in love with opening clubs after leaving office.\n\nHe had also opened Millionaires\u2019 Club at Ewet Housing Estate, Uyo, as well as Tabasco Transport Company just before completing his tenure as the speaker of Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly. Those two outfits had since packed up.\n\nA source said; \u201cThe incident occurred at about 9:00pm on Sunday night. The armed men stormed the sit-out with a Toyota Camry car and started shooting sporadically at random, sending the customers and other guests to scamper for safety before they made straight to the former Senator.\u201d\n\nEfiong was reportedly whisked away by the hoodlums in a Toyota Camry car to unknown destination, possibly for ransom negotiation leaving his Prado SUV behind at the club.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police (CP), Mr. Amiengheme Andrew, assured that \u201cthere will be a statement on the matter\u201d.\n\nBut the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress, speaking through their publicity secretary, Mr Nkereuwem Enyongekere, said the party was still awaiting confirmation of the incident by the police.\n\n\u201cIt did not happen in Oron. It happened in Uyo. .So we are waiting for formation by the police.\u201d The APC state spokesman said.\n\nEfiong is from Oron, and was equally stopped from returning to the Senate by another Oron politician and former minister for lands, Sen Akon Eyakenyi, of the PDP",

          "text": "By Blessing Ibunge\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has warned the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) against sabotaging the state government to freely administer its own tax and other related laws in the state.\n\nGovernor Wike gave the warning in a broadcast on Monday in Port Harcourt, while reacting to a Federal High Court ruling, which dismissed FIRS\u2019 move to stop the state government from collecting Valued Added Tax (VAT) pending the determination of the matter in court.\n\nEarlier Monday, Justice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, had dismissed a suit by the FIRS seeking to stop the state government from commencing with the collection of VAT.\n\nFIRS, in suit no FHC/PHC/149/2021, had approached the court seeking a stay of execution on the earlier judgment of the court that stopped FIRS from collecting VAT as it was constitutionally the role of the state government.\n\nThe FIRS had, following the judgment against it, sought the High Court to stop the state government from executing the judgment.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Pam said granting the application would negate the principle of equity.\n\nPam noted that inasmuch as the state government and the state legislature have enacted a law in respect of the VAT, courts were bound to obey the laws.\n\nHe noted that the state government and the state House of Assembly have duly enacted Rivers State Value Added Tax No. 4, 2021, which makes it a legitimate right of the state to collect VAT.\n\nThe judge said the law remained valid until it has been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, adding that the law enacted by the state legislature remained valid\n\nPam further said that granting the prayers of FIRS would amount to committing murder, noting that the prayers cannot stand and dismissed same.\n\nHowever, in his broadcast, Governor Wike stated that the Rivers State Government is in charge of the state and would not allow a further collection of tax from corporate bodies and businesses operating in the state by the federal government agency.\n\nThe governor added that FIRS has failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgment.\n\nHe frowned upon the reports of FIRS bulling cooperate bodies and business entities in the state for refusing to pay their tax to the agency.\n\nWike said: \u201cFollowing the recent judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, which upheld the constitutional right and authority of state governments to impose, collect and utilize value added taxes (VAT) within their respective territorial jurisdictions, the Rivers State Government enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax Law 2021 to regulate the effective administration of VAT in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the federal government, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), disagreed and filed an appeal coupled with a request for stay-of-execution of the judgment before the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cWhile the appeal was pending and without any stay-of-execution of the subsisting judgment, the FIRS went about to bully corporate bodies and business entities from paying the VAT to the Rivers State Government even when they knew that an appeal does not serve as a stay neither was there anything to stay in a declaratory judgment.\n\n\u201cAs a mere agency of the federal government without any political authority the effrontery and impunity exhibited by the FIRS against the Rivers State Government was ill-advised and highly provocative.\n\n\u201cHowever, being a government that believes in the rule of law, we decided on our own to suspend the enforcement of the Rivers State VAT Law 2021 pending the outcome of the FIRS\u2019s application for stay-of-execution.\n\n\u201cToday, the FIRS has failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgment.\n\n\u201cIt is important to reiterate the fact that we did no wrong in exercising our legal right under our constitutional democracy to stop the continuing breach, denial and curtailment of the constitutional right of states to lawfully impose and collect value added and other related taxes within jurisdiction to the exclusion of the federal government.\n\n\u201cAnd in doing so, our singular and progressive objective was to contribute to the advancement of fiscal federalism by enabling the federating states to explore and exploit their potential and capacity for generating greater internal revenues with which to fund their development goals and reduce the outdated over-reliance on pitiable Federal allocation and other handouts.\n\nNoting that some states with presently low economic activities and ethically restrictive social policies with economic implications may be adversely affected for now, the governor said: \u201cBut, this is not our own making. Like the right to derivation, this is also a constitutional prescription, which we all swore as political leaders to respect and defend as the supreme law of the land.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Why PDP May Lose All Southern States if It Zones Presidency to North",
          "text": "\u2022Delta, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Oyo vulnerable to APC take over\n\n\u2022Party still weak in most Northern, Middlebelt states, unlikely to make appreciable gains\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is a high possibility that the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) might pick its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election from the North, as stakeholders are set to zone the chairmanship position of the party to the South in a matter of weeks.\n\nThis, however, appears contrary to the survey by the THISDAY Economic Intelligence Group (EIG), which gleaned from the field that the decision could cost PDP the elections in practically all the southern states, the presidency and governorship inclusive.\n\nFindings also revealed that the PDP might not make any appreciable gains in the north and Middlebelt states either, as the All Progressives Congress (APC), is still likely to sweep the north even with a Southern candidate.\n\nOne key reality of the current state of play is that the PDP is still vulnerable in many northern states, including the ones it currently controls and the ones it doesn\u2019t. The party might, however, lose states like Taraba, Benue and unable to win back Plateau, if it decided to zone presidency to the north.\n\nAt centre of the war of attrition over the chairmanship of the party lies the desperate permutations of where the party zones its presidential ticket to. The Southerners, who want Secondus out, want him out to pave the way for a replacement from the north, while the northern group led by Atiku and co, wants him to either stay or be replaced by another southerner to solidify their push for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the north.\n\nIn the south, the particularly vulnerable key states that the PDP is likely to lose are Delta, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Oyo, if the ruling APC played smart by zoning its presidential ticket to the South. Such a move, findings showed, could give the APC a sweeping momentum in the countdown to the 2023 elections that would see it maintaining its hold on power.\n\nAccording to the THISDAY EIG survey, \u201cIf the PDP zones the Presidency to the North, they are likely to lose all their current Southern states, essentially, because of the mood in the South that Nigeria\u2019s Presidency should rotate between the North and the South.\n\n\u201cMost Southerners believe that, for equity, balance, cohesion, security and stability of the union, the next president should come from the Southern part of Nigeria, after Buhari would have completed eight years in 2023. To propose otherwise is almost an anathema among the political class and even among the average southerner.\n\n\u201cIt is that mood of the southern people that was reflected, when 17 southern governors met and asked that the president should go to the South. Right now, Southern leaders are so united that they don\u2019t want to be divided on the issue and don\u2019t mind where in the south the president comes from \u2013 whether from the South-east, South-south or South-west.\n\n\u201cThey are of the view that it is in the collective interest of the entire south to produce the next president. They believe all southern people should be entitled to run and whoever gets the ticket from the region would be accepted.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the undercurrent in the crisis over Uche Secondus\u2019 chairmanship in PDP, which has pitted Governor Nyesom Wike against Secondus, with many southern governors silently supporting Wike\u2019s position, believing that if Secondus retains the chairmanship of the party after the convention, the Presidency would automatically go to the North, which they don\u2019t want. Wike\u2019s attempt to force Secondus out is supported by most of the southern PDP governors, albeit quietly.\u201d\n\nThe survey further gathered that, \u201cMany of them (governors) are looking to people like Makarfi as a possible chairman of the party after Secondus.\n\nHowever, to counter them, the northern group with presidential bid led by a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; for President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Muhammed, supported tacitly by Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former Kano State governor, want the South to produce the next PDP chairman, even after Secondus, so that the presidency could be in the North.\u201d\n\nTo achieve this, the northern group has engaged individuals, like the Chairman of Daar Communications, Dr. Raymond Dokpesi, and others, who are also seeking to be vice president, from the South, to start speaking in support of the northern PDP members\u2019 agenda.\n\nFrom the analysis of the survey, if the trajectory of the country was reviewed from 1960, the North has produced more presidents, and in the 1999 Constitution, there is an agreement that for the survival of the country, power must rotate between North and South.\n\nIt was based on these undercurrents, that the THISDAY EIG carried out a survey, as it has always done since 1999, where it noticed that in each of the PDP states in the South, PDP was likely to lose the governorship with a northern presidency, given the overwhelming move in the South for a president from the region.\n\nThat momentum, from all indications, might therefore lead to the loss of states likes Cross River (the governor has already defected), Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Abia, Enugu and Oyo.\n\nCurrently, there would not be an election in Edo next year. However, Obaseki, although a PDP governor, the survey showed, is a firm believer in the southern presidency.\n\nThe southern governors believe that for the survival of the PDP post-2023, power has to move down South.\n\nAccording to the survey, the factors in each of the critical southern states, with seeming PDP influence, painted scenarios peculiar to them.\n\nIn Cross River, for instance, even though the governor has defected to the ruling APC, the state is predominantly PDP. But the governor, Professor Ben Ayade, the survey showed, would get momentum and defeat Liyel Imoke and Donald Duke \u2013 two former governors combined \u2013 if PDP chose a northern president and APC settled for a southern presidential candidate. This, the survey added, could make the governor take the state deeper into APC.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom situation is not quite different, according to the survey. While the governor, Udom Emmanuel, is by every measure considered to be doing well, a northern presidential candidate as the PDP standard bearer, would be a hard sell for him and could lose the state to other forces, such as the current APC National Secretary, Senator James Akpanudoedehe, and the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who would use federal incumbency to sweep PDP away.\n\nRivers, a crucial PDP state, might easily slip the way of former Governor Chibuike Amaechi, who is currently the Minister of Transportation, and effectively dislodging Governor Nyesom Wike, should the party embrace a northern presidential candidate. The state is already 50-50 for both leading parties and the APC has federal might to its advantage.\n\nBayelsa State is even more vulnerable, because despite the misgivings about the APC governorship candidate, David Lyon, who won by a majority of the public votes in the last election, the party still won. But the PDP only came in through the court. However, with the current Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, and huge federal forces and privileges, APC would just replay the card it played the last time, if the APC put forward a southern candidate and PDP went North.\n\nFrom Delta\u2019s axis, there\u2019s no debating the fact that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa is popular, especially, based on his performance record. But in the face of a southern candidate for APC and a northern candidate for PDP, his popularity would not save his party.\n\nThe party would most likely be swept out by the combined forces of the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, and the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, as well as others in the APC. With federal support, they would dislodge the PDP in Delta and sweep Okowa away, should the PDP present a northern president.\n\nThis scenario also applies to Oyo, being PDP\u2019s only state in the South-west, where Governor Seyi Makinde, is surrounded by counterparts from the ruling party. In fact, survey showed he is hugely disadvantaged.\n\nThe survey, nonetheless, from the permutations that came out during PDP\u2019s 92nd National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting some weeks ago, there were indications that the party might actually zone its presidential ticket to the North and the office of the national chairman to the South.\n\nAs a result of this, the governors of the party from the North, believed to have presidential interest, have begun to jostle to ensure the emergence of a national chairman that would be disposed to their aspiration.\n\nA former military governor of Lagos State and later civilian governor of Osun State, Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola, for instance, is said to be the favourite of many of the bigwigs, should the incumbent, Secondus, decide not to re-contest in the October 30th and 31th national convention in Abuja.\n\nSecondus, in a statement, had stated that his tenure as the national chairman would end on December 9 2021, because he was elected on December 9, 2017, and sworn in same day.\n\nRegardless, the embattled national chairman had recently debunked rumours that he had resigned from his position.\n\nA statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Ike Abonyi, dismissed the report as untrue, but he contended that he was merely obeying an interim court order at the time.\n\nHe added that as a law-abiding citizen, who had been an adherent of the rule of law as a basis for democracy, he had to stay away as a form of respect for the courts.\n\nThe offices of the national chairman of the PDP and other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) are guaranteed four-year term.\n\nOfficially, PDP is expected to submit the approved zoning of offices of the members of the NWC to the coming NEC meeting on September 9 2021, other stakeholders have been plotting to see that the NWC members elected were pliable to their aspiration.\n\nIn this regard, some stakeholders were believed to be working to ensure that the national chairmanship of the party was micro-zoned to the South-west, but a few others insisted that zoning it to the South-west might prove difficult, as it could amount to abridging the constitutional rights of Secondus to seek a constitutional re-election.\n\nOn his part, Dokpsei too has since debunked reports that he was in the chairmanship race. A statement from him claimed he wanted to keep his integrity and not soil or dent it.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody from the South-east has indicated interest in the presidential run, not even a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, who was Atiku\u2019s running mate in the 2019 presidential election.\n\nHowever, from the North, the list has continued to increase. There are several posters at the party secretariat in Abuja announcing the aspirations of Tambuwal, Atiku, Mohammed, Kwankwaso, and a former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido.\n\nAhead of the zoning for both the presidential ticket and office of the national chairman, the chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP, Senator Waliid Jubrin, and Dokpesi have said the main opposition party stood a better chance in 2023 with a northern candidate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "The party might, however, lose states like Taraba, Benue and unable to win back Plateau, if it decided to zone presidency to the north.\nAccording to the THISDAY EIG survey, \u201cIf the PDP zones the Presidency to the North, they are likely to lose all their current Southern states, essentially, because of the mood in the South that Nigeria\u2019s Presidency should rotate between the North and the South.\nHowever, Obaseki, although a PDP governor, the survey showed, is a firm believer in the southern presidency.\nAccording to the survey, the factors in each of the critical southern states, with seeming PDP influence, painted scenarios peculiar to them.\nWith federal support, they would dislodge the PDP in Delta and sweep Okowa away, should the PDP present a northern president.",

          "text": "The Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, more commonly known as Sunday Igboho, has berated one of his lawyers, Ibrahim Salami, for allegedly disrespecting him.\n\nIn a leaked audio obtained by SaharaReporters, Ighoho claimed the lawyer abandoned him and kept him waiting for over 15 minutes while speaking to someone else.\n\nSunday Igboho\n\nHe said, \u201cI told him (lawyer) I was hungry and had to eat, and he told me to go. I told him to see me; it wasn\u2019t because of those people that he came here now. I was waiting for him for 15 minutes.

I didn\u2019t know him before now; I wasn\u2019t expecting him at all. I didn\u2019t know it was Salami that lawyer, Falola, would be sending.

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Fintech Focus: The link between Open Banking and financial inclusion",
          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Entrepreneurs sidestep uncertainty to redefine farming in Jos",
          "text": "In recent weeks, Jos, the Plateau State capital, has been in the news over some killings that took place, and even 950 kilometres away in Lagos, one only needs to follow events to feel the tension. This was, however, not the case when BusinessDay visited the state weeks ago, and seeing first hand, a gentrification of sorts on the farms.\n\nApart from insecurity, which is now a national concern, off-taking agricultural goods remain a big deal and especially at risk are perishables like vegetables and fruits. Just as they can fetch a premium, especially in off-season, they are also easily lost and the millions a farmer should get could easily turn into zero, and possibly debt.\n\nSome farmers are however investing more in producing these crops, not only them, but exotic fruits, some of which, as BusinessDay learnt, are being exported.\n\nJos is known for its peculiar weather in Nigeria, but actually, much of Plateau State benefits from the unique combination of climate, topography and elevated hills.\n\n\u201cThe climate in Jos is a bit comparable to a temperate climate,\u201d says Marie Ekhator, an Austrian who runs Mama-Itohan RegenSoil, who BusinessDay met while in Jos. \u201cThat is why I decided to try seeds from my own climate,\u201d she says. One of such is monk cress, an edible flower that was growing in a trial bed along with other vegetables being experimented in a home garden.\n\nShe brings different varieties to Nigeria to find out which one will do well, so that she can plan for proper propagation. But before Ekhator, people in Jos had already figured out there was something special about their environment and it could support crops not indigenous to Nigeria.\n\nEven though its particularly cool weather may have been described as conducive for growing \u2018exotic crops,\u2019 farming in the state, like much of Nigeria, has historically been subsistence based.\n\nIn recent years, a crop of new, mostly young entrepreneurs, is not only riding on the wave of unique crops their environment puts them at an advantage to produce. They are making money from crops produced under regulated conditions and in seasons where most farmers in Nigeria would not be producing; these are especially vegetables from tomatoes, to bell pepper, which is their new cash crop. Fruits like grapes, pomegranates, strawberries, mulberries, gooseberries and a half dozen other types of berries, some of which this reporter was seeing for the first time, are being grown under regulated conditions.\n\n\u201cJos has comparative advantage in the sense that it is not the only one that can produce but it produces better,\u201d notes Nanpan Guyit, a trained economist who has found the agricultural economy more appealing.\n\nPaul Weng, who prefers to introduce himself as a gardener, while giving a tour of his farm (and home), points at three mulberry trees by the fence of his 10-plot property located a few meters from the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru.\n\nThose trees, he states, fetched him N450,000 in 2019, and this year, he has 32 being grown in a greenhouse nursery, to further cash in. In another part of the compound, he covers another tree with a net \u2013 from top to bottom. One may mistake it for one growing actual money, but for him, it could literally be so. The tree is covered from birds, who like another farmer, says are their main competitors.\n\nHe is one of thousands of educated farmers who have sought knowledge, applied it along with their passion for agriculture, and are making money on few plots of land, more than even those using many times bigger expanses.\n\nHis sale of mulberries two years ago was between N1200/1500 per kg, but currently sells for N2000/2500 per kg. Without expanding his land under cultivation, he is going to increase revenue by up to 20 times. Just from one crop that serves a rather niche market.\n\nRead also: Jos killings: LG chairman warns against reprisals\n\nWhile two years ago, BusinessDay reported that greenhouse farming may not yet be profitable in Nigeria based on some experiences in the South, but the revelation in Jos is a completely different reality. From improvised greenhouses made of wooden frames, to the proper galvanised steel types, the white structures dot many parts of the state, and no single farmer interviewed had anything short of good news to report. They may have had unpleasant experiences with management, but they reported profits, not loss.\n\n\u201cThe difference (in revenue) does justify the investment. Truth be told, a lot of farmers are starting to invest in farming this season,\u201d says Guyit, whose first time in farming 13 years ago was a near disaster.\n\nUsually, farmers avoid producing certain crops, especially vegetables in the rainy season, when managing the farm and crops, pests are hard to contain, unless of course, for those who own greenhouses. They are the ones who can produce and sell when there is scarcity, along with the very few who brave the odds of open field production in the rainy season.\n\n\u201cThings like broccoli, beef tomatoes, bell peppers can be produced off season and they will be very expensive. After growing them in greenhouses, the demand is usually very high from all over the country,\u201d emphasises Guyit. As he explains, in recent years, and the whole agric consciousness, more educated and middle-class people have started to go into agriculture, and they are able to afford investments like the greenhouses and irrigation systems.\n\nOne of such new entrants would be Wiebe Boer, whose LinkedIn post on going into farming in Plateau State generated some buzz. To most people, it was strange seeing an \u2018Oyinbo\u2019 who has worked in Oil and Gas, and currently with an off-grid power company, venturing into agriculture.\n\nHowever, he told BusinessDay, \u201cFirst, it\u2019s in my blood. My ancestors were farmers, and my surname \u2018Boer\u2019 means farmer. But, more importantly, because it\u2019s the best way to create jobs and economic opportunity in rural Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe land is one of Nigeria\u2019s greatest assets and a lot more people need to invest in agriculture to unlock the value for the investor, the farmers, and the nation.\u201d\n\nA story on emerging opportunities in the Jos landscape will be incomplete without Bell peppers, dubbed by many as the new cash crop. During its season, it sells at the farms for N700 per kg, at most, N1000 per kg. But now, it sells between N1500 and N2000 per kg from the farms. In the big supermarkets in places like Lagos and Abuja, similar quantities could sell five times more.\n\nThe Bell pepper is called an indeterminate plant, which means it grows non-stop, for as tall as 2 meters, and can be harvested for up to 18 months, depending on how one takes care of the crop. In a 300 to 400 square meters greenhouse, one could harvest an average of 200 kilograms per week and 800 kilograms every month. At N1,500 per kg comes to about N1.2 million per month from one green house, and that is one crop.

          "text": "In recent weeks, Jos, the Plateau State capital, has been in the news over some killings that took place, and even 950 kilometres away in Lagos, one only needs to follow events to feel the tension. This was, however, not the case when BusinessDay visited the state weeks ago, and seeing first hand, a gentrification of sorts on the farms.\n\nApart from insecurity, which is now a national concern, off-taking agricultural goods remain a big deal and especially at risk are perishables like vegetables and fruits. Just as they can fetch a premium, especially in off-season, they are also easily lost and the millions a farmer should get could easily turn into zero, and possibly debt.\n\nSome farmers are however investing more in producing these crops, not only them, but exotic fruits, some of which, as BusinessDay learnt, are being exported.\n\nJos is known for its peculiar weather in Nigeria, but actually, much of Plateau State benefits from the unique combination of climate, topography and elevated hills.\n\n\u201cThe climate in Jos is a bit comparable to a temperate climate,\u201d says Marie Ekhator, an Austrian who runs Mama-Itohan RegenSoil, who BusinessDay met while in Jos. \u201cThat is why I decided to try seeds from my own climate,\u201d she says. One of such is monk cress, an edible flower that was growing in a trial bed along with other vegetables being experimented in a home garden.\n\nShe brings different varieties to Nigeria to find out which one will do well, so that she can plan for proper propagation. But before Ekhator, people in Jos had already figured out there was something special about their environment and it could support crops not indigenous to Nigeria.\n\nEven though its particularly cool weather may have been described as conducive for growing \u2018exotic crops,\u2019 farming in the state, like much of Nigeria, has historically been subsistence based.\n\nIn recent years, a crop of new, mostly young entrepreneurs, is not only riding on the wave of unique crops their environment puts them at an advantage to produce. They are making money from crops produced under regulated conditions and in seasons where most farmers in Nigeria would not be producing; these are especially vegetables from tomatoes, to bell pepper, which is their new cash crop. Fruits like grapes, pomegranates, strawberries, mulberries, gooseberries and a half dozen other types of berries, some of which this reporter was seeing for the first time, are being grown under regulated conditions.\n\n\u201cJos has comparative advantage in the sense that it is not the only one that can produce but it produces better,\u201d notes Nanpan Guyit, a trained economist who has found the agricultural economy more appealing.\n\nPaul Weng, who prefers to introduce himself as a gardener, while giving a tour of his farm (and home), points at three mulberry trees by the fence of his 10-plot property located a few meters from the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru.\n\nThose trees, he states, fetched him N450,000 in 2019, and this year, he has 32 being grown in a greenhouse nursery, to further cash in. In another part of the compound, he covers another tree with a net \u2013 from top to bottom. One may mistake it for one growing actual money, but for him, it could literally be so. The tree is covered from birds, who like another farmer, says are their main competitors.\n\nHe is one of thousands of educated farmers who have sought knowledge, applied it along with their passion for agriculture, and are making money on few plots of land, more than even those using many times bigger expanses.\n\nHis sale of mulberries two years ago was between N1200/1500 per kg, but currently sells for N2000/2500 per kg. Without expanding his land under cultivation, he is going to increase revenue by up to 20 times. Just from one crop that serves a rather niche market.\n\nRead also: Jos killings: LG chairman warns against reprisals\n\nWhile two years ago, BusinessDay reported that greenhouse farming may not yet be profitable in Nigeria based on some experiences in the South, but the revelation in Jos is a completely different reality. From improvised greenhouses made of wooden frames, to the proper galvanised steel types, the white structures dot many parts of the state, and no single farmer interviewed had anything short of good news to report. They may have had unpleasant experiences with management, but they reported profits, not loss.\n\n\u201cThe difference (in revenue) does justify the investment. Truth be told, a lot of farmers are starting to invest in farming this season,\u201d says Guyit, whose first time in farming 13 years ago was a near disaster.\n\nUsually, farmers avoid producing certain crops, especially vegetables in the rainy season, when managing the farm and crops, pests are hard to contain, unless of course, for those who own greenhouses. They are the ones who can produce and sell when there is scarcity, along with the very few who brave the odds of open field production in the rainy season.\n\n\u201cThings like broccoli, beef tomatoes, bell peppers can be produced off season and they will be very expensive. After growing them in greenhouses, the demand is usually very high from all over the country,\u201d emphasises Guyit. As he explains, in recent years, and the whole agric consciousness, more educated and middle-class people have started to go into agriculture, and they are able to afford investments like the greenhouses and irrigation systems.\n\nOne of such new entrants would be Wiebe Boer, whose LinkedIn post on going into farming in Plateau State generated some buzz. To most people, it was strange seeing an \u2018Oyinbo\u2019 who has worked in Oil and Gas, and currently with an off-grid power company, venturing into agriculture.\n\nHowever, he told BusinessDay, \u201cFirst, it\u2019s in my blood. My ancestors were farmers, and my surname \u2018Boer\u2019 means farmer. But, more importantly, because it\u2019s the best way to create jobs and economic opportunity in rural Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe land is one of Nigeria\u2019s greatest assets and a lot more people need to invest in agriculture to unlock the value for the investor, the farmers, and the nation.\u201d\n\nA story on emerging opportunities in the Jos landscape will be incomplete without Bell peppers, dubbed by many as the new cash crop. During its season, it sells at the farms for N700 per kg, at most, N1000 per kg. But now, it sells between N1500 and N2000 per kg from the farms. In the big supermarkets in places like Lagos and Abuja, similar quantities could sell five times more.\n\nThe Bell pepper is called an indeterminate plant, which means it grows non-stop, for as tall as 2 meters, and can be harvested for up to 18 months, depending on how one takes care of the crop. In a 300 to 400 square meters greenhouse, one could harvest an average of 200 kilograms per week and 800 kilograms every month. At N1,500 per kg comes to about N1.2 million per month from one green house, and that is one crop. Having 10 of such greenhouses on just one hectare of land could be netting N12 million monthly.\n\nWhile none of the farmers on this trip had up to 10 greenhouses, one had six greenhouses, and many easily made this much money from bell peppers and other crops on their farms, which curiously, are not large but capital intensive due to the greenhouses.\n\nThey all also hardly expressed the need to get more land, as it turned out; productivity has little to do with expanse of land covered with crops.\n\nBusinessDay also learnt of a strawberry community in Jos, where that is what the whole community does. In a place called Chaha along Vom Road, Guyit, had in fact, showed a parcel of land he was growing strawberries this year, for someone who is to export them to other African countries.\n\nAt the time of visiting Jos in July, not many fruits were available to see, as most farms had just replanted in anticipation of the end of the rainy season.

          "title": "For educated Jos farmers, agric pays better than white-collar jobs",
          "text": "Picking what could be described as dirty farm work over a white-collar job is a no brainer for some educated young people, who are gradually thriving in the agribusiness space in Jos.\n\n34-year-old Heriju Gadzama, CEO, Greenhill Farms schooled in the US, where he also worked briefly before returning to Nigeria for National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), and served at the University of Jos in 2014.\n\nHe was later offered employment by the university in 2016, where he teaches business management and marketing. Farming started in 2017, a year after becoming a lecturer. When asked to compare farming and lecturing, and which returns more financially; \u201cdefinitely the farm,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLast year, ASUU was on strike from around January till this year and all that time we were not paid. There was also COVID. But because I had this farm, I was still able to survive, pay my staff on time and monthly,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Jos killings: LG chairman warns against reprisals\n\nFor him, lecturing is a way to give back, which he loves doing by impacting his students. It also allows him to have a flexible schedule maybe Mondays and Tuesdays on the farm, then Wednesdays and Thursdays, lecturing then Fridays, tries to combine a little bit of the two and get some rest.\n\n\u201cThe farm work is an ongoing thing and the ceiling for agriculture is higher than being a lecturer. In both regards, you cannot go into these occupations just for money; you have to be passionate about it,\u201d he says.\n\nGadzama\u2019s main cash crop is Bell pepper, but he has other supplementary crops in the open field, like red cabbage which he planted close to 15,000 plants.\n\nTrying to give perspective of financial gain, assuming he sold 10,000 of those red cabbages for N200 each, that would net him N2 million from just red cabbage, which is not even the real money spinner on his farm.\n\n\u201cObviously, I had to buy seeds, fertilizer etc but that alone is more than the annual salary an assistant lecturer would make at a federal university,\u201d he says. He cultivates vegetables on a 1.8-hectare farm in Kwang, with a combination of open field and greenhouse farming with six greenhouses. He grows bell peppers in the greenhouses as well as seedless cucumber and beef tomato. In the open field, he grows red cabbage, green beans, green pepper and just vegetables in general during the dry season. During the rainy season, he grows corn and has grown potatoes and organic strawberries during the dry season.\n\nFor Dabin Nenpominyi, an Economics graduate of Covenant University, who also holds a Masters degree from the University of Jos where he concentrated on international economics, going into agriculture is an exciting venture he is committing to.\n\nHe manages a seven-hectare Fonio farm in Kwall, for a business he says focuses on \u2018climate friendly\u2019 crops, which are those that do not require fertiliser and replenish the soil in the long run. Fonio, moringa, and hibiscus, which are the focus crops are being produced with a view to do more exports.\n\nNanpan Guyit started Jasond Bloom Enterprise as a recreational company but after a near-death experience following an accident, it was transformed into an agriculture company.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who had run his family\u2019s hotel business in the past and executed IT contracts through his company, started farming in 2008. He says he was ambitious and started with 8 acres.\n\n\u201cI was just excited and ambitious and felt I would conquer the world. Only to do that and realise that Nigeria is not ready for that, especially in the vegetable sector because they are perishable,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen someone told him to slow down and take it in bits, he says he thought to himself, \u2018No, you don\u2019t know what we are doing here. We want to feed the world!\u2019, but, now says he \u201clearnt his lessons\u201d.\n\nRather than give up, he says, \u201cas a trained economist, this type of thing intrigues me; I needed to understand why. That was what pulled me in even further.\u201d\n\nWith a first degree in Economics from Ahmadu Bello University, and a Banking and Finance Post-graduate diploma from the University of Abuja, he now cultivates an estimated 2.5 hectares he says is enough business. Among other vegetables, he produces a lot of bell peppers and at the time of meeting in Jos, was planting strawberry for someone that wants to ship them out of Nigeria to other African countries.\n\nWould he have done better with paid employment? \u201cI always believe in creating new wealth and I would still do this because for one I think I have better creative expression with farming,\u201d he responds.\n\nAfter 13 years of farming, he says \u201cit has been rewarding.\u201d\n\nPaul Weng is in his 50s but has only done salaried job for six years. Three years with an NGO and another three years with a company he did not state.\n\n\u201cAs I was working in those places, I was still practising my gardening and I realised there was more money in what I was doing than collecting salary so I opted out completely,\u201d he says. He admits it has not been easy because farming is the mainstay for his family of five; paying school fees and all the bills.\n\nHe cultivates about 10 plots of lands in total, but stresses, \u201cone thing people don\u2019t understand is it\u2019s not the size of the land that matters. Somebody can produce on one hectare and someone else on half hectare, yet the half-hectare can produce more. It all boils down to the farming practices.\u201d While he produces a range of crops, mostly vegetables and berries, he farms strawberries, mulberries and gooseberries in commercial quantities.\n\nTwo years ago, he realised about N450,000 from three mulberry trees and now has 32 in nurseries to expand on that particular crop as a business.\n\nRuth Damar, a 24-year-old maker of spices, graduated from the University of Jos in 2017 with a Political Science degree, but started the business in 2015 while in school.\n\n\u201cI actually tried taking a job last year but it was a distraction to my hustle so I just left it,\u201d she says. Damar produces organic spices such as turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, chilli, curry seasonings all in powdered form, selling to those who package for retail, restaurants, and directly to individuals.\n\nDoes she get more revenue compared to formal employment? \u201cVery well!\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cI know I\u2019m not exactly where I want to be but it has potentials, and there\u2019s room for growth. If I were to work somewhere, how much will they pay me?\u201d\n\nChristiana Tongman also studied Political Science before working in a bank for four years. She quit banking and later started farming using both conventional greenhouses and, interestingly, repurposing uncompleted structures inside the family compound, to function as greenhouses. Like most greenhouse farmers, her main crop is the bell pepper, and the income helps complement the family\u2019s earnings.",

It is necessary that we are taking the issue of security seriously.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAs a state, we will continue to work with the national authorities.

We are facing our challenges like other countries and communities in the world and that is where we need leaders like you to step up.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what people do to you personally; as long as you know you are there serving God and the people, doing what we believe is the right thing and in the interest of our people and our country.

To access these towns is now a big problem except maybe by canoes.\n\n\u201cRight now, a proper work will have to be done. It is a federal road, so we have to notify the Federal Ministry of Works so they can send their people down to see the extent of failure of the bridge and a portion of the road. And if in a few days nothing is done, part of the road will be washed off from what we have seen.\n\n\u201cWe actually need the presence of the Federal Government seriously now to come help the Uzere people, Ekregbisi, Abare, Asaba-Ase. In fact, this is the only link to the riverine areas.

It is only now we are getting to know that the flood that has been coming year in, year out had been eating up under the bridge, the centre section of it. I passed that place barely seven minutes before the bridge collapsed, before 8am\u201d.\n\nHe further disclosed that , prior to the construction of the bridge in 1992, the alternative access road was one constructed by Shell, \u201cbut as of now, that road is washed off\u201d.

          "title": "How and Why Buhari Regime Killed Olajide Sowore, By SKC Ogbonnia",
          "text": "It is a rude awaking to learn the coldblooded murder of Felix Olajide Sowore, the younger brother of Omoyele Sowore, the Nigeria\u2019s frontline democracy activist, anticorruption crusader, and the presidential candidate in the 2019 elections. This dimension of terrorism under President Muhammadu Buhari is a redux to the Abacha regime where families of political opponents were targeted at will.\n\nTo rub salt into the open injury, Buhari\u2019s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo (SAN), claimed that they \u201cwould be pressurising the law-enforcement agents to track down these killers without delay and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nThis is impunity gone too far. Who is fooling who? How can they bring to justice known culprits who are generally made unknown by the same government? How many cases and how many unknowns? Which type of unknown killer is the regime referring to this time? The unknown soldier or unknown policeman? The unknown \u201cForeign\u201d Fulani Herdsmen or the unknown bandits that have become notorious lexicons of the Buhari presidency?\n\nFellow countrymen and women, Mr. Keyamo and cohorts should look no further. Enough of the deceit! Duplicity has limit.\n\nThe truth is that the unknown is well-known. The killer of Felix Olajide Sowore resides in the Buhari temple where Festus Keyamo is a high-ranking priest.\n\nFrankly, it has become very necessary to question Kayemo\u2019s credentials and principle, especially where he parades himself as an ex-human rights lawyer, and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) for that matter. In short, Chief Abdul-Ganiyu \u201cGani\u201d Oyesola Fawehinmi would be rolling in his grave, wondering how on earth he allowed Mr. Festus Kayemo to ever serve in Fawehinmi\u2019s law chamber.\n\nThe Gani, we know, would remind Kayemo that the history of \u201cunknown\u201d murderers in Nigeria dated back to 1977 when \u201cunknown soldiers\u201d were used to storm the residence of Fela Anikulapo Kuti, throwing his aged mother out of a second-floor window. The woman would eventually die from injuries sustained from the terrorist act. The sole purpose of the invasion was to silence Fela Kuti, who was at the time the fiercest critic of the government headed by General Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nSuccessive dictators have since adopted the style to kill and maim their political opponents and their families.\n\nThe list is long. But Kayemo cannot fathom forgetting the murder of Dele Giwa in 1986, a case the late Gani Fawehinmi fought for and promised to fight even in his grave. A seasoned journalist and editor of Newswatch magazine, Giwa was bold to expose the criminalities under the regime of Ibrahim Babangida. Decades later, despite the sacrifices of Fawehinmi to seek justice for the news editor, Nigerian government is yet to pressure \u201claw-enforcement agents to track down these killers\u201d of Dele.\n\nGeneral Sani Abacha\u2019s regime followed by perfecting the art of serial murders in an attempt to compel M.K.O Abiola to abandon his mandate. One of the victims was no other than Kudirat Abiola, the senior the wife of M.K.O.\n\nThese terrorist acts are not mere coincidences. The murders are politically planned and executed.\n\nYet, the Nigerian history has never recorded a worse political terrorism than the situation being witnessed under the current Buhari regime. Upon gaining power in 2015, General Buhari quickly employed the services of Foreign Fulani Herdsmen, together with \u201claw-enforcement agents\u201d to maraud the country as unknown gunmen, targeting opposing regions and political opponents. Even when and where the terrorists are caught redhandedly, the regime still classifies them as unknown.\n\nOne of the many examples is the case of the leader of the secessionist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, a well-known Buhari nemesis. The president has constantly deployed unknown members of the armed forces to kill IPOB followers.\n\nAn unforgettable instance was when a contingent of Nigerian armed forces invaded Kanu\u2019s country home at the middle of night in 2017, killing innocent citizens. This very terrorist incident subjected Kanu\u2019s parents to all manners of post-traumatic stress disorder, which eventually claimed the lives of both the mother and father. The mission, of course, was to cow down IPOB leader from his opposition activities.\n\nA more recent state-sponsored terrorist activity against the opponents of the Buhari regime took place at the residence of the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. Like the style used in terrorizing Nnamdi Kanu, a combination of police and soldiers descended on Igboho\u2019s house at middle of night mid-2021, killing innocent followers.\n\nThis unprovoked incident, coupled with the crude abduction of Kanu from Kenya by the Nigerian government, ignited a worldwide outrage. It is true that President Muhammadu Buhari is a slowpoke, clodpole, as well as a goldbrick, but he can still differentiate between day and night. At least, he understood that life does not begin and end in Nigeria. He quickly recognized that his failing health depends on doctors located outside the shores of the country. Thus, a change in tactics for terrorist activities against the president\u2019s political opponents has become imminent.\n\nEnter Sowore. The publisher of the widely circulated Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore, does not need further introduction. A prisoner of conscience, who has remained in captivity in Nigeria since 2019, Sowore has emerged as the thorniest opponent of Buhari regime. Though the terrorist authority has been toying with various forms of untoward plot against the human rights activist, they know not to approach his case like Kanu or Igboho. This explains why General Buhari is toeing the Abacha model by targeting Sowore\u2019s relations.\n\nThe objective summary judgment, if it is not already manifest, is that the brutal murder of Felix Olajide Sowore, the younger brother of the publisher of Sahara Reporters, is not a mere coincidence. The police report says it all. The Buhari regime has blood on its hand. Therefore, the Hon. Festus Kayemo has his work cut out for him. If the SAN suffixed after his name does not translate to Senior Advocate of Nonsense, Kayemo should quickly join us to pressurize \u201cthe law-enforcement agents to track down\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari without delay and bring him to justice.\n\n*Dr. SKC Ogbonnia, a 2019 APC Presidential Aspirant, writes from Houston, Texas.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nDisclaimer: Views expressed in the opinion section of the platform are those of the authors and don\u2019t reflect editorial policy of this newspaper.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nRivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has directed the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to commence the full enforcement and implementation of the State Valued Added Tax Law 2021.\n\nThe governor who gave the directive during a state-wide broadcast, on the heels of a ruling by a Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, yesterday affirming the right of states to VAT, noted that the appeal by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) against the judgement doesn\u2019t translate to stay of execution.\n\nJustice Stephen Daylop Pam had dismissed Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) application, in Suit No FHC/PHC/149/2021, seeking for a Stay of Execution on the earlier judgement of the court that stopped FIRS from collecting VAT, as it was constitutionally the role of state governments.\n\nJustice Pam, in his ruling yesterday, said granting the application would negate the principle of equity.\n\nHe noted that, in as much as the Rivers government and the state legislature had enacted a law in respect of the VAT, that courts were bound to obey laws.\n\nGovernor Wike, shortly after the court ruling, directed RSRS to commence total enforcement and implementation of the VAT, warning that the state government would not tolerate any attempt from any quarters to sabotage the process.\n\n\u2018As we all know, following the recent judgement of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, which upheld the constitutional right and authority of State Governments to impose, collect and utilize value added taxes (VAT) within their respective territorial jurisdictions, the Rivers State Government enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax Law 2021 to regulate the effective administration of VAT in Rivers State,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the Federal Government, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), disagreed and filed an appeal coupled with a request for stay-of execution of the judgment before the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cWhile the appeal was pending and without any stay of-execution of the subsisting judgement, the FIRS went about to bully corporate bodies and business entities from paying the VAT to the Rivers State Government even when they knew that an appeal does not serve as a stay neither was there anything to stay in a declaratory judgement.\n\n\u201cAs a mere agency of the Federal Government without any political authority the effrontery and impunity exhibited by the FIRS against the Rivers State Government was ill-advised and highly provocative.\n\n\u201cHowever, being a government that believes in the rule of law we decided on our own to suspend the enforcement of the Rivers State VAT Law 2021 pending the outcome of the FIRS\u2019s application for stay of-execution\n\n\u201cToday, the FIRS has failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the State\u2019s Law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgement.\n\n\u201cIt is important to reiterate the fact that we did no wrong in exercising our legal right under our constitutional democracy to stop the continuing breach, denial and curtailment of the constitutional right of States to lawfully impose and collect value added and other related taxes within jurisdiction to the exclusion of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cAnd in doing so our singular and progressive objective was to contribute to the advancement of fiscal federalism by enabling the federating States to explore and exploit their potential and capacity for generating greater internal revenues with which to fund their development goals and reduce the outdated over-reliance on pitiable Federal allocation and other handouts.\n\n\u201cNaturally, some States with presently low economic activities and ethically restrictive social policies with economic implications may be adversely affected for now.\n\n\u201cBut, this is not our own making. Like the right to derivation, this is also a constitutional prescription, which we all swore as political leaders to respect and defend as the supreme law of the land.\n\n\u201cAbove all, fiscal federalism remains the right path to economic self-reliance and sustainability for all our States and the benefits derivable from this case by all the States in the long run far outweigh the immediate revenue loss that some States may presently suffer.\n\n\u201cAll that is required is for all of us to wear our thinking caps as elected Governors to collectively fight for the greater devolution of resources, responsibilities and powers to the federating States.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore very unfortunate that some State Governors led by that of Katsina State are vainly conspiring to truncate this progressive reality in favour of the inequitable status quo so that the Federal Government can continue to rob Peter to pay Paul as the nation\u2019s self-imposed tax master-general.\n\n\u201cFor us in Rivers State, we will continue to ensure and project our constitutional rights to access all possible resources we can take hold both within and outside our geographical boundaries to advance the progress of our State.\n\n\u201cAnd with today\u2019s judgement the way is now clear for the administration and enforcement of the Rivers State Value Added Tax Law 2021 across the entire State until otherwise decided and set aside by the Superior Courts.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I hereby direct the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to ensure the full and total implementation and enforcement of this law against all corporate bodies, business entities and individuals with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cAll corporate bodies, business entities and individuals are advised to willingly, truthfully and promptly comply with their tax obligations under this law to avoid the full weight of the stipulated sanctions, including having their business premises sealed-up including having their business premises sealed-up.\n\n\u201cLet me warn that the Rivers State Government is fully in charge of the State and will not tolerate any further attempt by the FIRS to sabotage or undermine our authority to freely administer our tax and other related laws in our own State. Those who play with fire risks having their fingers burnt. Enough of the shenanigans.\n\n\u201d I wish to further assure every resident that we shall as usual make effective use of the expected proceeds from this tax to accelerate the development of our State and improve the wellbeing of everyone.\u201d\n\nWike also used the broadcast to warn residents of the state against letting down their guard against Covid-19, noting that the virus is spreading at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201d Fellow citizens, let me also draw your attention to the alarming rate of transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic in our State.\n\n\u201cThe daily figures released form the NCDC show that both the transmission and death rates in the last two weeks have consistently been on a rising spiral because residents and visitors to the State have largely abandoned their responsibility to comply with the existing COVID-19 Protocols,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cClearly, we are headed for a serious health disaster of profound consequences if residents and visitors continue to behave as if the pandemic no longer exists or impotent in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cThis is a big lie and we cannot afford to continue to close our eyes to the dangers such irresponsible behaviour poses to the health, lives and livelihood of everyone.\n\n\u201d Accordingly, I wish to remind residents of the subsisting protocols on regular washing of hands and use of alcohol-based sanitizer, maintaining social distancing; wearing of face masks at all public places, including transport vehicles and going for immediate testing and treatment whenever you notice any of the symptoms.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that vaccinations have been proven to protect against infection, and encouraged people of the state to take jabs.\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to all residents to help protect yourself, your loved ones and the rest of the citizens by getting your jab at the designated health centres in the 23 Local Government Areas of the State as they become available,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201d I also appeal to religious leaders and churches to convince and encourage their followers and members to please go out and take the vaccines and comply with the covid-19 protocols in addition.\n\n\u201cAlthough it remains our desire to keep the State open and allow citizens to go about their social, religious and economic activities unimpeded.\n\n\u201cBut we may be constrained to re-imposed the suspended COVID-19 lockdown measures across the State if the transmission of the disease continues to increase beyond tolerable limits.\n\n\u201cFinally, we wish to reiterate that the ongoing demolition of shanties was borne out of the compelling need to safeguard lives and property across the State.\n\n\u201cOur objective, which is gradually achieving is to deny the criminals these sanctuaries and hideouts from which they embark on their criminal activities and safely return to.\n\n\u201cWe therefore refuse to be blackmailed by those unpatriotic elements who are trying to stir false ethnic, religious or tribal sentiments around our patriotic commitment to advance the safety and security of residents.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we refuse to be intimidated by such baseless pranks. Rather, we will not rest until we clear the State of all shanties wherever they are located and restore sanity to our environment and achieve a better sense of comfort and security for everyone.\n\n\u201cOnce again, thank you all for your support, prayer and understanding as we continue to work together to advance our collective security, peace and progress.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi Osogbo\n\nThe National Committee for Local Government Congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, has announced results of the congress held in all the 30 Local Government Areas and One Area Office in the State.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye who announced the results at a press conference in Osogbo on Monday, disclosed that the results were compiled and announced in line with the constitution of the party, having satisfied all the constitutional requirements and party\u2019s principles and guidelines.\n\nHe also reiterated that there was no other Congress in Osun other than the one the Committee conducted and that was monitored by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and security operatives.\n\nElegbeleye, therefore, described as illegal, null and void, results of any other purported congress held in the State. He added that the committee was sent by the national secretariat of the party to conduct LG congress for Osun APC and not a group within the party.\n\nAccording to him, the committee was not informed of any other congress except the one its members witnessed and supervised across the State.\n\nElegbeleye who described as fallacy, the purported claims of another congress held by some members of a group in the party, said \u201can election can only hold if the dissenting members sufficiently and appropriately informed the Committee of the need to do so\u201d.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe Committee resolved to hold a Stakeholders\u2019 meeting as part of efforts to register their presence in the State, ratify the decision of the leadership of the party as to either a consensus arrangement or election would be adopted and inform any member or group of people in the party who may opt for election the need to do so having properly being informed as the case may be.\n\n\u201cWe have the results of the 30 Local Government Areas and Ife-East Area Office with us. We were here yesterday for the compilation of the results coming from the Local Governments.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, we are here to conduct the Local Government Congress for All Progressives Congress in Osun State and not for any group. We were sent by the National Secretariat, Abuja to come and conduct Local Government Congress for APC in Osun and not for a group or members of a group in the he party. And not a single member of this Committee is aware of any group in the party as being speculated.\n\n\u201cAll we know at the Secretariat is that there is one APC in Osun, that is why we were sent to conduct the Congress, and as you can see, we are at the Secretariat of the party not elsewhere. This is the party Secretariat known by the leadership and every member of the party.\n\n\u201cWe were here last Friday to hold stakeholders\u2019 meeting where we had leaders of the party. So also today, as you can see, we equally have leaders of the party here present for the Press Conference.\n\n\u201cIn our visit to some of the local government areas, we couldn\u2019t see any other place rather than the designated centres where the Congress was supposed to be held and nobody contacted us in contrary. Nobody or group of persons informed us there will be Congress elsewhere.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, none of the committee members was informed of any other venue other than where the exercise was genuinely held across the state. We are seven in number and all of us are here. We all witnessed the election.\n\n\u201cMyself and my colleagues use this opportunity to thank members of the press and the party\u2019s leadership in the State for your cooperation and support and for the peaceful conduct of the Congress.\n\n\u201cI believe that the APC in the State now have the new executive members at the various Councils to pilot the affairs of the party for the next four years,\u201d Elegbeleye said.\n\nWhen asked if the Committee was aware that some members of the party agitated for election instead of consensus which was largely adopted by the leadership of the party, the committee chairman said during the Stakeholders\u2019 meeting, there was no motion against the popular consensus adopted by the party.\n\nHe added: \u201cOn Friday, we held a stakeholder\u2019s meeting and I said the party had opted for consensus but in area where there are disagreements and people want to really go out and vote, they are so much allowed and for someone to insist that he won an election, he must have notified us that in a particular area they want to vote, and as I said, nobody, I mean nobody till now gave us any notification of any other congress elsewhere.\n\n\u201cNobody notified us that they don\u2019t want consensus, nobody notified us they want election till this present moment. Nobody notified us that there is a crisis in any local government that required election. What we are not aware of, we can\u2019t act on it.\n\n\u201cWe are not from Osun and every member of the party knows the procedure, they know we are around. Nobody can claim that he doesn\u2019t know we are around that was why a stakeholders\u2019 meeting was held to further announce our presence.\n\n\u201cSo, as far as we are concerned, any congress outside the one we supervised, monitored and subsequently announced its results is a nullity.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Caretaker Chairman of the APC in the State, Prince Gboyega Famodun, commended the members of the Committee for \u2018a job well done\u2019.\n\nFamodun who expressed displeasure over the conduct of some members of the party, noted that \u201cno pressure group in APC can equate its strength to that of the party itself that is fully registered and constitutionally constituted.\u201d",

There are two kinds of polio cases; Wild cases of polio are caused by poliovirus that is circulating naturally in the environment.\n\n\u201cVaccine-derived polioviruses are extremely rare and exist under specific circumstances.

This can actually be good because it then immunizes them. When the strain no longer finds susceptible children, it dies out,\u201d he added.\n\nHe warned against the dangers of undermining routine immunisation, saying, \u201cThe problem occurs in areas of low vaccination.

Eventually, if they are allowed to circulate long enough, at least 12 months, they can mutate into strains that are strong enough to cause paralysis,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe assured stakeholders that the oral polio vaccine had reduced the number of polio cases by 99.9 percent, noting that the risk posed by wild poliovirus was greater than the risk of an outbreak caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus.

In local governments, we said two filling stations will operate and in those filling stations, nobody will sell fuel in jerrycans and gallons.\n\n\u201cThere may be some hardship but it is better now to take the hardship now in order to restore normalcy.

He said bandits operate on the strength of their informants whom he said were scattered all over the state, dispensing security information to the criminals in the bush through the use of mobile phones and other communication gadgets.\n\nHe said many military operations have been sabotaged due to the activities of informants, thereby, affecting the onslaught of the Nigerian Air Force and other sister agencies against the bandits.\n\nThe governor urged the Federal Government to shut down telecommunication sites in at least 13 local government areas in Katsina rife with banditry.\n\n\u201cWe are not advocating the total shut down in Katsina State but we have about 13 local government areas on the border that should be shut and this will give us the opportunity to operate without informants,\u201d he said.

He said bandits operate on the strength of their informants whom he said were scattered all over the state, dispensing security information to the criminals in the bush through the use of mobile phones and other communication gadgets.\n\nHe said many military operations have been sabotaged due to the activities of informants, thereby, affecting the onslaught of the Nigerian Air Force and other sister agencies against the bandits.\n\nThe governor urged the Federal Government to shut down telecommunication sites in at least 13 local government areas in Katsina rife with banditry.\n\n\u201cWe are not advocating the total shut down in Katsina State but we have about 13 local government areas on the border that should be shut and this will give us the opportunity to operate without informants,\u201d he said.

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

          "text": "The Lagos State Government has filed murder charges against Chidinma Ojukwu and another person, Adedapo Quadri, for the murder of the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV, Usifo Ataga.\n\nChannels Television gathered this on Monday when Chidinma was brought before a Chief Magistrate court sitting in the Yaba area of Lagos.\n\nThe prison wardens attached to the court barred journalists from accessing the area through which she arrived, dressed in a black hooded jumpsuit around 9am. They also did not allow journalists access to the area when she left the courtroom.\n\nCounsel to the police, Cyril Ajiofor told Magistrate Adeola Adedayo that the police had received legal advice from the office of the Directorate of Public Prosecution(DPP) on the case.\n\nREAD ALSO: Super TV CEO\u2019s Family Writes IGP, Demands Thorough Probe And Justice\n\nMurder Charge\n\nChannels Television obtained a copy of the DPP\u2019s advice which says that after careful consideration of facts available in the case file, a prima facie case of conspiracy to murder, murder, and conspiracy to commit felony exists against the 300 level Mass Communication student of the University of Lagos, Chidinma and Quadri.\n\nA prima facie case of stealing exists against Chidinma alone.\n\nThe DPP also established the offence of having possession of a stolen item against Chidinma\u2019s sister, Egbuchu Chioma from whom the deceased\u2019s iPhone 7, was said to have been recovered.\n\nAs a result, Channels Television learnt that the Director of Public Prosecution, Mrs Olayinka Adeyemi, has filed charges against the three suspects at the Lagos High Court, but has yet to get a date for the hearing of the case.\n\nThe DPP will prosecute Chindinma and Quadri \u201cfor the offences of conspiring to murder, murder, conspiracy to commit felony to wit: forgery, forgery and making documents without authority contracts to Sections 233, 222, 411, 363, and 370 respectively of the Criminal Law, Cap. C17 Vo.3 Laws of Lagos State, 2015.\u201d\n\nAlso, the DPP will prosecute Chindinma\u2019s sister Chioma \u201cfor the offence of having possession of thing (sic) reasonably suspected to have been stolen contrary to Section 329 of Criminal Law, Cap. C17 Vol.3 Laos of Lagos State, 2015\u201d. The DPP in her advice cleared 11 other suspects and asked that they be released on the grounds that no offence had been disclosed against them in respect of the case.\n\nThe 11 are: Babalola Disu, Olowu Ifeoluwa, Olutayo Abayomi, Nkechi Mogbo, and Ojukwu Onoh.\n\nOthers are Tony Okonye, Damilola Adekoya, Bola Adekoya, Segun Akinsanya, Oluwatoni Dada and Adams Kenneth.\n\nBased on this information, Magistrate Adedayo also discharged Chidinma\u2019s father, Ojukwu Onoh and four others who had initially been arraigned by the police for alleged obstruction of justice and failing to report a crime to the law enforcement agencies. Magistrate Adedayo recommended Chidinma for trial at the Lagos High Court as the magistrate court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain a murder charge.\n\nShe, however, ordered the further remand of Chidinma and the two others to be tried and adjourned till Sept 29 to await further information from the DPP as to the status of the case at the High Court.\n\nREAD ALSO: [VIDEO] UNILAG Student Arrested Over Murder Of Super TV CEO, Claims He Forcefully Had Sex With Her\n\nThe Twists\n\nThe Lagos State Government\u2019s move is the latest in the murder saga which began in June.\n\nPolice authorities in the state had paraded Chidinma for allegedly murdering Ataga.\n\nThe media mogul was found in a pool of his blood with multiple wounds on his body after he was reportedly stabbed to death at a hotel where he lodges in the Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nChidinma had initially admitted to murdering Ataga, explaining that she did so in self defence after the Super TV CEO allegedly attempted to rape her.\n\nBut in a swift turn of events, the student denied killing the victim.\n\n\u201cAs I was leaving the apartment, he stood up to lock the door. When I came back, I knocked but there was no response. Then I opened the door and realized it wasn\u2019t locked,\u201d she said, weeks after the murder story made headlines across the nation.\n\n\u201cThe duvet was on the floor and pillows. The couch was facing the door and the bed was stained with blood and the floor where he was. Music was on, the TV was on. The room was in disarray like someone broke in.\n\n\u201cThen I saw him on the floor, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was afraid. I thought if I raised an alarm I would be arrested because we were the only people in the room.\u201d\n\nDays later, the National Assembly also waded into the matter, asking the police to ensure the accused does not die in their custody.\n\nRepresentative Tolulope Sadipe, who raised the motion as a matter of urgent public importance, expressed worries over the media trial and public parade Chidinma had been subjected to.\n\nThe lawmaker argued that the accused could become depressed and eventually commit suicide.",

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has ordered the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to fully implement the State Value-Added Tax Law 2021 which he assented to recently.\n\nThis follows the failure of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to stop the state government from collecting VAT, having filed an application at a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, the state capital.\n\n\u201cWith today (Monday\u2019s) judgement, the way is now clear for the administration and enforcement of the Rivers State Value-Added Tax Law 2021 across the entire state until otherwise decided and set aside by the superior courts,\u201d the governor said in a statewide broadcast on Monday, hours after the court refused the suit by FIRS.\n\nREAD ALSO: Court Refuses FIRS Application To Stop Rivers Govt From Collecting VAT\n\n\u201cConsequently, I hereby direct the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to ensure the full and total implementation and enforcement of this law against all corporate bodies, business entities, and individuals with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cLet me warn that the Rivers State government is fully in charge of the state and will not tolerate any further attempt by the FIRS to sabotage or undermine our authority to freely administer our tax and other related laws in our own state. Those who play with fire risk having their fingers burnt; enough of the shenanigans.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike also directed all corporate bodies, business entities, and individuals in Rivers to willingly, truthfully and promptly comply with their tax obligations under the law.\n\nHe warned that those who fail in such responsibilities risk sanctions, including having their business premises sealed up by the government.\n\n\u2018We Did No Wrong\u2019\n\nThe governor assured residents that his administration would effectively use the expected proceeds from the collected tax to accelerate the development of the state and improve their well being.\n\nHe explained that the enactment of the VAT law followed a recent judgement of the court that upheld the constitutional right and authority of state governments to impose, collect, and utilise VAT within their respective territorial jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the Federal Government, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), disagreed and filed an appeal coupled with a request for stay-of-execution of the judgment before the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cWhile the appeal was pending and without any stay-of-execution of the subsisting judgement, the FIRS went about to bully corporate bodies and business entities from paying the VAT to the Rivers State government, even when they knew that an appeal does not serve as a stay, neither was there anything to stay in a declaratory judgement,\u201d Governor Wike said.\n\n\u201cAs a mere agency of the Federal Government without any political authority, the effrontery and impunity exhibited by the FIRS against the Rivers State government were ill-advised and highly provocative.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the government had decided to suspend the enforcement of the VAT Law pending the outcome of the FIRS\u2019s application for stay-of-execution.\n\nAccording to the governor, the state did no wrong in exercising its legal right under a constitutional democracy to stop the continuing breach, denial, and curtailment of the constitutional right of states to lawfully impose and collect value-added and other related taxes within their jurisdiction.\n\nHe said the objective of such action was to contribute to the advancement of fiscal federalism by enabling the federating states to explore their potential and capacity for generating greater internal revenues.\n\nGovernor Wike, however, admitted that some states with presently low economic activities and ethically restrictive social policies with economic implications may be adversely affected for now.\n\n\u201cAbove all, fiscal federalism remains the right path to economic self-reliance and sustainability for all our states and the benefits derivable from this case by all the states in the long run far outweigh the immediate revenue loss that some states may presently suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior to the governor\u2019s broadcast, Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam refused the application by FIRS, seeking to stop the Rivers State government from collecting VAT.\n\nHe held that the revenue agency failed to file an application to set aside the tax law recently enacted by the Rivers State House of Assembly and signed by Governor Wike on August 19, therefore, the state law on VAT was valid and subsisting.",

He noted that inasmuch as the state government and the state legislature have enacted a law in respect of the VAT, courts were bound to obey the laws.\n\nHe noted that the state government and the state House of Assembly have duly enacted Rivers State Value Added Tax No. 4, 2021, which makes it a legitimate right of the state to collect VAT.\n\nThe judge said the law remained valid until it has been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction, adding that the law enacted by the state legislature remained valid\n\n\u201cToday, the FIRS has failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgment,\u201d Governor Wike said in the broadcast.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I hereby direct the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to ensure the full and total implementation and enforcement of this law against all corporate bodies, business entities and individuals with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cAll corporate bodies, business entities and individuals are advised to willingly, truthfully and promptly comply with their tax obligations under this law to avoid the full weight of the stipulated sanctions, including having their business premises sealed-up.\n\n\u201cLet me warn that the Rivers State Government is fully in charge of the State and will not tolerate any further attempt by the FIRS to sabotage or undermine our authority to freely administer our tax and other related laws in our own State.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike also frowned at reports of FIRS bulling cooperate bodies and business entities in the state for refusing to pay their tax to the agency.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe effrontery and impunity exhibited by the mere FIRS agency without any political authority against the Rivers State Government was ill-advised and highly provocative.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

Defence bulwark Olaoluwa Aina also left.\n\nTuesday\u2019s encounter, scheduled for the 5,000 \u2013capactiy Est\u00e1dio Municipal Ad\u00e9rito Sena, affords a number of ambitious fresh legs not deployed in Friday\u2019s 2-0 win over Liberia in Lagos to stake claims for permanent shirts in the Nigeria squad.\n\nThe absence of Olaoluwa Aina, William Ekong and Leon Balogun probably means that Italy \u2013based Tyronne Ebuehi, Chidozie Awaziem of FC Boavista in Portugal and Spain \u2013based Kenneth Omeruo will start against the Blue Sharks on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe departures of two \u2013goal hero Kelechi Iheanacho and Alex Iwobi also open the door for perhaps Terem Moffi and Henry Onyekuru. But it is in the midfield that Coach Gernot Rohr would have to empanel entirely unaccustomed partners and charge them to deliver.\n\nOghenekaro Etebo, Wilfred Ndidi and Joseph Ayodele-Aribo have all returned to the UK. Coach Rohr may opt to deploy the versatile Abdullahi Shehu to the midfield as he has done a couple of times, most recently in Sierra Leone against the Leone Stars in a 2021 AFCON qualifier. Russia \u2013based Chidera Ejuke, Italy \u2013based former junior international Kingsley Michael and new face Innocent Bonke from Sweden are all available.\n\nCaptain Ahmed Musa will earn his 100th cap for Nigeria, two days on 11 years after he won his first against Madagascar in Calabar, if he takes any part in Tuesday\u2019s encounter.\n\nThree points will consolidate Nigeria\u2019s leadership of Group C, confirmed after the victory over Liberia that followed the draw between Cape Verde and Central African Republic in Douala. A win will guarantee Nigeria a minimum three points ahead of any other team in the pool, even if Liberia\u2019s Lone Star are victorious against Central African Republic in Monrovia.\n\nA win will also brighten the path of the three \u2013time African champions to the knockout final round, given that home-and-away fixture against the Central African Republic is what is on the plate in October.\n\nEAGLES IN CAPE VERDE\n\nGoalkeepers: Francis Uzoho (APOEL Nicosia, Cyprus); Daniel Akpeyi (Kaizer Chiefs, South Africa); Maduka Okoye (Sparta Rotterdam, The Netherlands)\n\nDefenders: Chidozie Awaziem (FC Boavista, Portugal); Kenneth Omeruo (CD Leganes, Spain); Jamilu Collins (SC Padeborn 07, Germany); Abdullahi Shehu (AC Omonia, Cyprus); Zaidu Sanusi (FC Porto, Portugal); Valentine Ozornwafor (Sporting Charleroi, Belgium); Tyronne Ebuehi (Venezia FC, Italy);\n\nMidfielders: Chidera Ejuke (CSKA Moscow, Russia); Innocent Bonke (Malmo FF, Sweden); Kingsley Michael (Bologna FC, Italy); Adekunele Adeleke (Abia Warriors);\n\nForwards: Ahmed Musa (Fatih Karagumruk, Turkey); Samuel Kalu (FC Bordeaux, France); Victor Osimhen (Napoli FC, Italy); Moses Simon (FC Nantes, France); Paul Onuachu (KRC Genk, Belgium); Terem Moffi (FC Lorient, France); Henry Onyekuru (Olympiacos FC, Greece)",
