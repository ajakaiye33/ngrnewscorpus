          "text": ".\n\n\u2026As NMA Applauded Gov Emmanuel for making A\u2019Ibom workers highest paid in Nigeria\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest syringe production company, Jubilee Syringe Factory in Akwa Ibom State is set to expand its scope of production to cover varieties of medical consumables, as the government doubles efforts to suitably position the state as a budding medical tourism destination.\n\nThe state governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, dropped the hint while playing host to a delegation of the Akwa Ibom Chapter of Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, at Government House, Uyo.\n\nAffirming his administration\u2019s resolve to ensure a holistic approach in consolidating the state\u2019s healthcare sector, Governor Emmanuel said the Jubilee Syringe Factory, beyond its reputation of largest syringe production capacity in Africa, will soon venture into production of all plastic medical consumables, assuring that the state-of-the-art Akwa Ibom State University Teaching Hospital, AKSUTH, underway, will be a model tertiary hospital.\n\n\u201cNot just the syringe, we are starting other consumables; everything plastic consumable in the medical line, like all those gloves. \u2026We need a lot of your support in setting up our Teaching Hospital and we really mean business about that. As a state, we are doing well in secondary healthcare system. We jumped to establish a quaternary hospital. The next level is to set up a very good tertiary hospital. When we run that one well, well equipped, it will give birth to a College of Medicine. With what we have in mind and what we are going to bring in, we will have the best Teaching Hospital owned by a state government\u201d, he stated.\n\nHe said with AKSUTH the state was set to bridge the gap between the already existing ultra-modern secondary and quaternary medical facilities in the state, while reaffirming his administration\u2019s resolve to maintain the status quo of the health workers in the state being the highest paid nationwide.\n\nGovernor Emmanuel commended the sacrifice of medical practitioners in the state government fight against COVID-19 and congratulated the new NMA leadership in the state on their emergence and urged them to use the pivotal position of the NMA in the medical field to support state government\u2019s drive towards a holistic development of the healthcare sector, by liaising with the various sister bodies to ensure best practices in by practitioners in the sub-sectors.\n\nHe stressed that lack of good surgery recovery plan, bedside manners, laboratory services and other complementary services, can render the medical practice counterproductive.\n\nIn his words, \u201cPlease let\u2019s look at medical profession as a total approach\u2026. As NMA you should have a way of controlling other ancillary services. Where I am suffering very much now, as a governor, is bedside manners with recovering patients. When you finish as the Doctor it is not all over. The recovery of that patient at times is as serious as what you did, especially in the theatre. You only go on ward rounds, may be in the morning or evening, you don\u2019t know what happens to those people, but I\u2019m getting a whole lot of reports of terrible bedside manners of nurses and other medical workers. Where I\u2019m also having a whole lot of issues is all these labs being set up and we are going to clampdown on them very soon\u201d.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the leader of the delegation and Chairman Akwa Ibom State chapter of the NMA, Dr. Ime Udoh, thanked Governor Emmanuel for being the first Chief Executive to grant the Association audience in the state and lauded his administration\u2019s passionate attention to healthcare.\n\nHe said the Governor\u2019s approval Consolidated Medical Salary Scale, CONMESS, which places workers in the state government employ as highest paid in the country, the prowess brought to bear in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, the AKSUTH initiative and other ventures in the health sector were indicative the government\u2019s acknowledgement of health as the substratum on which is created, adding that the government has not only prevented capital flight from the state, but has, through the Jubilee Syringe Factory, attract medical tourism to the state.\n\nDr Udoh used the opportunity of the visit to inform the Governor of the 2021 Physicians Week, scheduled to hold in the state in October.",

          "title": "Nollywood yet to marry storytelling with technicalities \u2015 Elenini producers",
          "text": "By Ayo Onikoyi\n\nAllen Onyige and Adeniyi Joseph Omobulejo are the producers of Yoruba drama series, Elenini currently running on GOTV/DSTV Nigeria and both are graduates of Multichoice Talent Factory. In this interview with Potpourri the duo (Onyige from Rivers State) and (Omobulejo from Ogun State) share their experience in producing the series and how GOTV/Multichoice has impacted them and the movie industry at large.\n\nWhat inspired the story behind the production of \u201cElenini\u201d?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nELENINI is a story about an Igbo man who is married to a Yoruba lady but has a wife in his home town. Hell will break loose when the Igbo wife comes visiting.\n\nI can\u2019t particularly say what event inspired the story. I think, though, that it might have been inspired by my day-to-day conversations with Adeniyi Joseph and the cultural differences that were unearthed. I\u2019m from Rivers State and he is from Ogun state.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nELENINI is actually a product of another story that we couldn\u2019t afford to do at the time and We knew from the beginning who our audiences were and we had to tell a simple story very relatable to them.\n\nAs an African story what message are you sending out?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nOur key message is \u201cLove and Tolerance\u201d We all know the cultural tension we face in Nigeria. If you follow our story, you will understand what we did with our characters. For instance, \u201cUzor\u201d, our lead character, made decisions out of love and not culture, even though his family tried to tie him down to a cultural marriage he had never accepted.\n\nALSO READ: How adventurous can you get as you grow older\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nThere are a lot of themes that the story explores, such as the consequences of infidelity, dreaming big, friendship, platonic and romantic love. There is just something for everyone to learn while they are entertained.\n\nIs there an ill in the society that you are trying to address by the story?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nWe are trying to promote intercultural relationships. In a country like Nigeria where people are constantly looking for a group to align with, it will make sense for us to see ourselves as one. One of the best ways this can happen is through marriages. Well, marriages that happen out of \u201clove\u201d.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nInfidelity is more of a personal issue than it is a societal issue but if we are able to fix the person, then we have fixed the society.\n\nWhat challenges were there in producing the series?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nIn producing this series, the major problem we had was people management. We got to engage almost 300 people (Cast and Crew). Asides the \u2018drama\u2019 we were producing, we were dealing with people\u2019s individual drama that sometimes cost us production time.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nLike every production there were challenges and mostly unforeseen but the biggest of them is human management which also happens to be my biggest lesson\n\nHow has the exposure of your production on GOtv impacted you and the industry?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE\n\nThere is a popular quote that says \u201cKnowledge is power\u201d. The knowledge that I gained from the production has elevated me and has equipped me with the needed experience that most people seek in the industry. This means that I can easily execute any kind of project without fear. Just bring it on.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO\n\nThe impact is a process. we have however received a lot of good feedback on social media like twitter because GOtv has given the show a very wide coverage and some persons have reached out to applaud the fact that it\u2019s a premium content delivered in Yoruba which raises the standard for other producers and ultimately impacts the industry in terms of the quality of what is produced.\n\nWhat lessons did you learn from MTF that you deployed in this production?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nMTF is not an academy where one is taught just filmmaking. We were also taught about the business of filmmaking. For me, the project was almost like a practical course from MTF. All I did was put to use what I had learned from MTF. This included people management, integrity, accountability, storytelling, technical skills, business management, emotional intelligence etc.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nMTF is really about fixing mindsets and It helped me further realize my capacity as a leader and that skill was severely tested during the production of ELENINI which has made me find myself and as such I have increased capacity in many ways and increasing capacity is the only way to be relevant.\n\nAs MTF graduates, how well have you integrated into the mainstream Nollywood ?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nWith the wealth of knowledge and experience, I have had, it is safe to say I can easily find myself in mainstream Nollywood. However, with the challenges facing Nollywood, it is not clear if I have integrated or not. Nollywood has not been able to marry storytelling and the technicalities of storytelling. This results in backwardness. Sometimes, it is traceable to the budget and investors.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nMTF already prepared us for this by introducing us to industry professionals but what\u2019s really important in Nollywood is to show capacity consistently and we have shown a bit of what we can do and we just hope for more opportunities to do more and more and then we can help contribute to the industry and engage people who in turn will contribute to the industry\n\nAs film producers, what are the inadequacies of the Yoruba movie industry, both technical and business wise?\n\nALLEN ONYIGE:\n\nOne great thing about the Yoruba movie industry is that they have a loyal audience, despite the inadequacies. One of the obvious inadequacies is poor execution in both story-telling and technicality. If this problem is efficiently addressed, I\u2019m confident the Yoruba movie industry will get the accolades that it deserves.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t think there is a \u2018Yoruba movie industry\u2019, I just think that there is a Nigerian film industry that gives us a lot of freedom to tell stories through different languages because of the many ethnicities in Nigeria. So in my opinion, there is no \u2018English, Hausa Or Yoruba film industry\u2019 there is just a Nigerian Film Industry.\n\nThe Inadequacies are obvious and I think it\u2019s largely dependent on the quality of information that the practitioners have, the level of skill which can be fixed through learning and one way is by merely intentionally watching videos on YouTube and just by being dedicated to self development. A lot of the problems are not even budget related, they are just capacity related. There is so much I can say about this topic.\n\nCan you introduce yourselves and the next fantasies for you, regarding film/series production?\n\nALSO READ: Human stump found under bridge in Oyo\n\nALLEN ONYIGE\n\nMy name is Allen Onyige. I\u2019m a passionate filmmaker from Nigeria and I run a production company called \u201cANECDOTE MEDIA\u201d. At \u201cANECDOTE MEDIA\u201d, we tell human stories in different forms (Documentary, Adverts, Feature-length Films, Series, Music Videos etc.) My fantasy is to keep telling stories and these stories can come in various forms.\n\nADENIYI JOSEPH OMOBULEJO:\n\nMy name is Adeniyi Joseph-Omobulejo also known as TAJ, which is short for \u2018The Adeniyi Joseph\u2019 I am the Series Producer of ELENINI and Co Executive Producer with Allen. I started a production company called Nostalgia Media Agency in 2016, where we create content for brands and are also the producers of ELENINI.\n\nI am a storyteller, I make films, commercials, documentaries and all such audio visual content. I like to say that I make stories work. I want to tell stories that actually provide inspiration because I believe that stories can fix people and whatever one is dependent on for information or entertainment has a very high chance of influencing them. The Christian version of that is that faith comes by the continuous hearing of the word of God. I\u2019d like to make a web series!\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Prince Ejeh Josh\n\nThe timeless expression that no nation or state has ever achieved virtuosic and remarkable feats without the strenuous efforts of some dedicated, selfless and goal-driven legends who took upon themselves, the pains and inconveniences associated with development and holistic transformation of their society is only reiterative, indisputable, immutable and at the risk of repeating the known. Within the microcosm of their historical epoch, these selfless leaders saw the alleviation of their people\u2019s plights as the ultimate sacrifice and price to be borne by them by all means. These set of pathfinders are, however, rare to encounter especially in a world distorted with the antics of individualism, capitalism and commodification of the commonwealth for personal aggrandizement.\n\nThe above analytic description is true of the Executive Governor of Enugu State, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyichukwu Ugwuanyi. This is basically true when a critical review of governance is launched into his administrative style of leadership since his ascendance to power as the Governor of the state in 2015. For those who have enthusiastically observed the politics and administrative will of Enugu State since 1999 when Nigeria was ushered into the Fourth Republic, events unfolding since Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration have pointed towards the direction of a new system of governance. It is a radical paradigm shift from elitist\u2019s political propagation to people-centred administration where the primary concern of the state has been how to sustain the democracy dividends and good governance the people of the state are currently enjoying.\n\nUndoubtedly, political watchers and analysts both within and outside the state have been fascinated by an Enugu State where conscious, principled, logical and well-defined architectural pattern of governance has been laid over the past six years with a view to dissecting rural-urban dichotomy, and the need of bridging the gap, and creating more urban centres in rural communities as promised by the Governor in 2015 and further reiterated in 2019 during the swearing-in ceremonies at Michael Okpara Square, Enugu. To achieve these uncommon feats, the governor had to exhibit some exceptional characters and qualities uncommon to Nigerian politicians and perplexing to the political system. It was a celebrated innovation driven by the selfless desire to lay a new foundation and redefine the political norm for the interest of the general populace.\n\nIn order to reassure the people of Enugu State his administration would live up to its promises of entrenching democracy and ingraining good governance where every citizen of the state will feel the pulse of good governance and appreciate the true definition of democracy beyond the pages of papers, the governor not only accommodated members of opposition and worked with them for the development and progress of the state; he took development projects to their respective communities without political discrimination. That is the first step of laying the foundation for the peaceful atmosphere the people of the state are enjoying today. He was prepared to see that, irrespective of political affiliation and sentiment, every member or citizen of the state feels the presence of his government. By so doing, he brings good governance to bear on every household in the state.\n\nAvailable data indicate that previous governments and administrations had treated rural areas in the state with sheer neglect and utmost contempt despite the significant roles played by them as the goose that laid the golden eggs from agro-allied to production industries. It is on record that some rural communities, which are by no means, the least, had been on the altar of neglect for years. To the inhabitants of these communities, the principles of democracy have been constricted to \u201celectioneering processes and nothing more\u201d. This is understandable as efforts had been on the state capital being the commercial hub of the state. The perspective of the past administrations in concentrating development at the centre, without sounding critical and judgmental, had been adjudged unsatisfactory as they failed to meet up with the yearning, needs and aspirations of the people.\n\nMoreover, this led to the congestion of the Enugu metropolis with its attendant massive rural-urban migration. This has translated to a drastic abandonment of agriculture, and in many cases, gave rise to a frenetic gang of blue-collar job seekers prowling the nooks and crannies of the urban areas which has severely threatened socio-economic and food security in the state.\n\nTo arrest this portentous menace, Governor Ugwuanyi immediately swung into action, and in a swift move to also fulfill his campaign promises to the rural communities in the state, initiated life-changing programmes such as massive employment generation, enhanced social services and amenities, rural electrification and reconstruction of new and old roads long abandoned, and his calculated move to urbanize these non-urban areas.\n\nAs a follow\u2013up to the above smart and quality progammes, the governor further initiated the \u201cEvery-Community-One-Project\u201d programme where all the autonomous communities in the state were to identify a pressing project that would be funded and consolidated by the state government. It was a celebration of democracy and good governance in action the day cheques were handed over to each of the communities for the execution of these projects. It is, hence, arguable that no state in Nigeria other than Enugu state has ever conceived this kind of initiative. They could only toe the same step as replica of what Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration has laid.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, our checks on the past and present records of all the states of the federation revealed that this idea was novel to them. In passing a verdict on this lofty democratic journey, Dr. Sam Ugwuozor, a political analyst and a theorist, had tersely submitted that the innate purpose and meaning of politics is the common good of all people and all groups. Good political activity which is subsumed in true democracy is a way of helping to live faithfully in the freedom and solidarity that befits human dignity and make possible the attainment of social justice and peace.\n\nThis rural-urban blend which has assumed a new vocabulary development in the political lexicon of Nigeria, and often referred to as \u201cRura-banisation policy\u201d initiated by the state government is just an aspect of systematization of governance in the state. For many political observers and public affairs analysts, the definition of true governance could be painstakingly discovered from the potency of the above laudable policy. This is coupled with the government\u2019s already paraphernalia of power distribution, wealth creation, and economic empowerment programmes that have not only hit the wave of governance, but kept the ground running. It will also be recalled that the governor had commissioned a great number of breathtaking projects in the state in the past years. Most of these projects which included but not limited to construction of new roads where none had existed, provision of multi-billion Naira ultra-modern healthcare system, new fire service stations and fire service trucks, construction and renovation of both primary and secondary schools for a higher standard of education in rural communities. It was a deliberate move to decentralize the government in order to accommodate the rural dwellers. It is surprising that the governor could decentralize and delegate his powers where many state governors have arrogated upon themselves, power beyond their jurisdiction. This deliberate policy was driven by the urge to set the pace in governance, with the effect of building and investing more on the state\u2019s institutions rather than on individuals. The Governor has never minced words in his determination to alter the pendulum and drive down democracy dividends to every home in the state, and to achieve this, he believes that strong institutions must be built and consolidated.\n\nA tour to most of the communities in Enugu state would leave one astounded as more works are being executed on daily basis. This exemplary leadership by the governor has given a sense of belonging and rejuvenated the hopes of those long abandoned. Today, more commercial cities are being created by this administration in its effort to redefine democracy in the language that even the dumb can understand and the blind can feel. Worthy of mention is the state government intervention on the 22km Ehamufu-Nkalagu Federal Road once known to be notorious for accidents, and business stagnation. This singular act has opened Isi-Uzo local government to free-flow commercial activities with other parts of the state, and by extension, other states. It\u2019s a hope and light at the end of the tunnel for the people of the area.\n\nPresently, there are massive ongoing projects of integrating the 17 local government areas in the state for greater development, commercial diversification and business complement for mutual benefits by the Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration. To say the least, these projects couldn\u2019t have been possible without fiscal discipline, vision, determination and teamwork in the face of lean resources by the governor\u2019s team of strategic think-tank. It is a kind of discipline worth emulating by other state governments. It is a philosophy laden with the willingness to accept responsibilities and tackle them decisively.\n\nOne would, however, wonder the secret behind the enormous successes recorded this far by the Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration at a period the nation is grasping with cash crunch, economic austerity, and lurking disaster. A time many states of the federation have precariously relapsed into almost banana republic, where their citizens lack the basic good things of life due to the inability to pay workers\u2019 salaries, pensions and gratuities; a time life has become what the English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, once described as a \u201cstate of nature where life is brutish, nasty, and short\u201d due to extravagant imprudence of those saddled with governance responsibility. It is not surprising that with this ugly development, many had expected the worst to happen; especially as the hope of Nigerians continues to glow dim in the country they call their own.\n\nWhat is surprising, however, is the pace at which Governor Ugwuanyi has performed amidst this trying time. For analysts and even those critical of his administration, Ugwuanyi has got some magic wands that have led his administration to be rated as a topnotch state in democracy dividends and established good governance despite the biting financial misnomer in the country. The effect of this was to insulate the citizens from the scourge of misfortune wreaking havoc on other states. To drive this further down the boulevard of good governance, Enugu State under Governor Ugwuanyi was one of the first states to implement the national minimum in Nigeria. The Governor has kept pace with regular payment of workers\u2019 salaries, pensions and gratuities. Surprisingly, while other states are retrenching and down-sizing their labour-force, and have even taken further step to slash their salaries, the Enugu State governor has reassured the people of the state that retrenching staff or slashing their salaries would be his last option. Thus, it\u2019s glaring that where many states have faltered, Enugu state, despite being one of the states that receive the least federal allocation, saw opportunities in such challenge and used it as its stepping stone for good governance.\n\nFor us, however, far from attributing Ugwanyi\u2019s successes to any magical superstition, his administration has been a devoted disciple of financial prudence, shrewd and pragmatic management of both human and material resources to attain its lofty goals. The administration is penchant for taking a dramatic departure from over reliance on monolithic economy powered by crude oil to economic diversification where the state has now ventured into services, tourism, hospitality, agriculture and technology as a way of generating more income to meet the need of the people.\n\nAside Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s unrivaled successes in the Enugu metropolis such as roads\u2019 infrastructure, construction of a new flyover to ease traffic congestion and create enabling environment for business to thrive, social welfare, investment and youth empowerment through the MSMEs, massive infrastructural development, positive transformation of the education sector, subsidization of the health sector, etc. which will be a topic for another any, rural areas have been major beneficiaries of Ugwuanyi\u2019s paradigm shift in the governance of Enugu State. This is a time for urban dwellers to be envious of communities in rural areas as the government has made provisions and will continue to reach out to the people through life-changing amenities in different communities, ranging from electricity, pipe-borne water, roads network, and soft loans for agriculture, social and physical security to basic healthcare facilities.\n\nOf recent, Enugu state was able to tame the scourge of COVID-19 and swiftly stamped it out despite the fact that the state serves as a strategic gateway between the north and the east. This is understandable. Prior to the outbreak of the deadly pandemic, the administration of Governor Ugwuanyi had already constructed some world class medical structures, equipped with modern medical facilities which served as a preemptive strategy to shrug off the virus when it finally hit the state. This uncommon good governance gesture could be seen in the completion of the ultra-modern diagnostic centre in the state, the construction of Type 3 Primary Health Care Centre in some of the local government areas, construction and equipment of modern cottage hospitals, and other massive rehabilitation of existing health care centres across the state.\n\nIn addition, in the area of agriculture, the Governor\u2019s appointment of Hon. Mike Ogbuekwe as Special Adviser on Agriculture and Focal Person, Enugu State Non-Oil Export Programme, set the pace for revolution in agriculture in the State. It is predicted that, with the established system of agricultural yielding on ground, Enugu State would surpass its neighbouring states in production of certain agricultural produce such as rich and tomatoes, Enugu state having been leading in cashew, pepper, and palm productions. With these incentives, the youths are going back to agriculture, generating incomes and are becoming employers of labour. As a product of this concerted effort, the state recently rolled out its \u201cCoal City Rice\u201d in a massive way. It\u2019s a great feat in the right direction. These cereals have greatly helped in alleviating the plight caused by COVID-19 havoc as the state has continued to reach out to many household within the state through the State Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIn areas of critical infrastructure, the Governor has hinted that his administration would not relent in its determination to ensure that projects are taking to even the smallest community in state. In the meantime, some of the projects already executed include but not limited to the following; the Inyaba Bridge in Naknu East local government area which has provided some \u201ceconomic links\u201d for the people of Amagunze, Amechi-Idodo, and the people of Enugu East local government area; the Ndemde Bridge in Enugu South local government area; the rural electrification and water projects in Olido, Umuida and Umuopu in Igbo-Eze North council area; the Ogbaku Road in Agwu; Agbani-Afor-Amuri Road in Nkanu local council; the Iheaka-Ibagwa-Itchi-Unadu-Ovoko Road in Igbo-Eze South council; the Ekochin-Ekeani-Miliken Hill-New Market Road in Enugu North, the 14 kilometer Opi-Nsukka dual carriage way, Enugu State University of Science and Technology Teaching Hospital, Igbo-Eno, the 13 kilometer Abakpa-Emene link, the beautifully crafted Emene-Ugwuomu road, and a host of others too numerous to mention. Moreover, more projects are being flagged-off and, indeed, fully executed in non-urban areas which include, constructions of Obollo-Eke Junction; Agala-Okpaligbo Junction; Ohom Orba-Amajioka-Umuikeoha-Agu Orba, and Okpu Agu Orba Road in Udenu local government area. Worthy of mention also are; the Ogurute-Mkpamute-Igogoro-Ikpamodo-Okpo-Amaja Road in Igbo Eze North, and the Ugbwakwa-Nara-Nkerefi Federal Road which has attracted the Governor\u2019s timeous intervention. Available statistical records showed Enugu State under the leadership of Governor Ugwuanyi has completed over 650 kilometre roads just within the space of 6 years without losing focus on other critical sectors in the state.\n\nFurthermore, the Governor, out of his magnanimous act of meekness for local government workers, had ordered that all salaries due to them be promptly paid with immediate effect especially from those inherited by his administration. No more complaint. He did not stop there; he equally ordered that pensions and gratuities of both the retirees and those in active service be paid without further delay once the funds are available. This is materializing and the reality is now like a dream come true. Today, the endorsement and implementation of the new minimum wage in the state have brought succour for Civil servants who are always jubilating at the mention of Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s name for the new lease of life. One thing is peculiar to the governor; he doesn\u2019t wait to be reminded or persuaded before spreading his tentacle of democracy and good governance to the people. His is a democracy weaved around the people; both the high and the low. This astute demonstration of good governance has gone a long way in sending messages to the world about the man the Governor Ugwuanyi is. He has marked himself as a tested, trusted and reliable leader especially in time of economic tribulations. This could have accounted why he has always been decorated with countless awards of good governance from all the corners of the world.\n\nThis is a man who came at a time there was no hope for the people. He came as a rescuer of his people, and changed the face of governance not just in Enugu State but also in Nigeria at large. With the way things stand today, we have read on different occasions from national dailies where many non-indigenes of Enugu State have continued to wish they had the like of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as their state governor. This could only be described as a modicum of what the governor represents before the public. The summary of this analogy simply implies that, we have a master sheriff in the country. A sheriff whose achievements are drumming for him from far and near, and in his presence and behind him. A sheriff who does not need to visit or invite the media and press for any form of propaganda as others do before recognition is given to his good works.\n\nUgwuanyi is a sheriff who remains undistracted and focused in his bid to make Enugu state one of the world\u2019s smartest cities. A sheriff whose system of governance has been unanimously accepted by members of the opposition who have, with one accord, branded him with the title; \u201cOmenuko\u201d, an Igbo personage for one who achieves laudable feats in austere times.\n\nInterestingly, the Omenuko\u2019s uncommon strides did not go unappreciated as different sections of non-partisan bodies have kept on rolling out drums in celebration of the governor as a sign of appreciation to him. Flowing from this is the call by these bodies for Governor Ugwuanyi to declare his intention for the 2023 election to enable the continuity of his good governance in the country. His paradigm shift in governance has compelled both southerners and northerners to call on him to consider vying for president in 2023 general elections. Ugwuanyi is seen as a unifier, achiever, driver of modern economy and torchbearer.\n\nThe acceptance of the governor by all and sundry shows that the state government has no dissident voices in its modes of accountability and transparency in the management of the state\u2019s resources. Indeed, the governor has been able to woo members of the opposition with his leadership style which they saw as all-encompassing. To the members of the opposition, Govervor Ugwuanyi deserves a resounding applause owing to the fact that he has performed beyond expectation, and still performing. They have equally acknowledged the sacred fact that \u201cit is leaders who make democracy works\u201d. Enugu State under Governor Ugwuanyi is not only working, but safe and sound for the citizens.\n\nIt is hopeful that this gesture will be massively reciprocated by the people by supporting the government through prompt payment of taxes, obedience to law and protection of public institutions. With the foundation of this social and political surgery already systematized, and laid as a precedent for others by the governor, one can boldly acclaim that Enugu State is truly safe, and is, indeed, in the hands of God.\n\nPrince Ejeh Josh, BSc, LLB, MSc, NIM, PhD (in view)",

          "text": "A human rights activist and legal luminary, Barr James Ibor, has alleged that Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State ordered his personal aides on security to manhandle him, some journalists and others.\n\nAddressing newsmen in Calabar, the state capital, Barr Ibor stressed how he and others were beaten on Saturday during a peaceful protest to mark Democracy Day.\n\nHe alleged that when Ayade\u2019s convoy arrived where they were distributing flyers to people, his aides ordered them to run but they refused, hence the beating.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that the protesters were at the newspaper office where they had assembled with placards alongside human rights activists led by Barrister James Ibor to mark the June 12 Democracy Day.\n\nHe said they held a series of meetings with the state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande, who approved of the protest but advised them to cancel the Freedom Park venue they intended to use and rather use the front premises of an online newspaper\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police sent a team of policemen numbering about 50 to stay with them alongside men of the DSS. We were very peaceful as we chanted our songs and shared leaflets which were purely demanding for good governance both at state and federal levels. Nothing more.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe policemen and DSS operatives can attest to this. The deputy commissioner of police and other senior officers were standing beside me.\n\n\u201cSuddenly the governor\u2019s long convoy stopped by. His personal security details and some appointees jumped out from the convoy, and moved quickly towards us. They demanded that we run away for our lives. We said we were not going to run.\n\n\u201cThe DSS and policemen told them that they were fully in charge of the situation because the CP had approved but the governor\u2019s aides would hear nothing of the sort.\n\n\u201cThey tear gassed us. Some of them with masks punched us. You can see these bruises over my face, my shirt was torn. I was kicked and slapped and pushed into the gutter. Agba Jalingo and two other journalists who also came to monitor the peaceful protest, suffered the same fate.\u201d\n\nIbor who is principal counsel to Basic Rights Initiative and chairman of Child Protection Network said he will definitely proceed to the court to seek justice.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the Governor, Christian Ita denied that the governor was present in the said convoy and doubted if it was the Ayade\u2019s convoy.\n\nHe reminded that the governor had issued a directive, warning against any forms of public protest.",

          "text": "By Adeniyi Adewoyin\n\nPopular gospel singer Sola Allyson has weighed in on the knockdown of trending song \u201cOniduro\u201d by Tope Alabi.\n\nAlabi had descended on the song by Adeyinka Alaseyori, saying it was meaningless and not inspired by God.\n\nBut Allyson insisted God is the ultimate guarantor.\n\nTope Alabi, during a song ministration in a church, had said: \u201cWhat kind of song is that? God is not my guarantor, he is more than a guarantor.\n\n\u201cAlthough I have tried to correct the singer (who isn\u2019t the original composer) but she got angry. I loved that song but when I tried to sing it the Holy Spirit told me to shut up\u201d.\n\nAlabi\u2019s comments had drawn reactions from the public, including her colleague Sola Allyson who took to social media to air her opinion.\n\nSola said: On\u00ed\u00ecd\u00far\u00f3 mi, \u1eb8 \u1e62\u00c9 OOO! For me and many souls which connect to this song, On\u00ed\u00ecd\u00far\u00f3 mi, we have stories which clearly show that we would have been forgotten long ago if not for the guarantor side of The FATHER that was expressed in our lives\u2026\n\nCommending Yinka Alaseyori, she said: \u201cI commend Yinka for making the song more accessible to souls all over the world and I wish her more help in all her doings.\n\n\u201cThe song tells the story of many of us who had no backing from anyone and none to rest on or be as hiding place as to what our tomorrow would have been.\n\n\u201cI first heard this song years ago from Mama Bola Are at my home-out-of-home, @agape_pground in Akure and I immediately connected with it because, me, I would have been ridiculed and deserted and forgotten! The song helps me express my gratitude in that respect very succinctly.\n\n\u201cI have come to learn that we understand the concept of GOD differently, depending on how we were \u201cgiven\u201d and how much we are granted to see as we make effort to dig deeper. And that\u2019s why I live my life devoid of divides which different abilities in understanding breed\u2026\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know much about life. I am still a learner who seeks for my mind to be renewed daily but one of the few things I know dunj\u00fadunj\u00fa and d\u00e1j\u00fad\u00e1j\u00fa in life is that I received the help of a guarantor, an On\u00ed\u00ecd\u00far\u00f3 from The Realms of GOD, The Almighty, at times when it was obvious that generational j\u00e0nk\u00e1r\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300 would have stalled me from fulfilling destiny.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTimes when, as a lawful captive, foundational voices vibrated higher than my own and I was going to be consumed! I was set free by The ultimate Guarantor, On\u00ed\u00ecd\u00far\u00f3 mi! And I became totally free to walk as I should in destiny, to grow and thrive as should be\u2026\n\n\u201cWe see in parts. GOD, The FATHER Is revealed to us in different ways and sides depending on many things\u2026\n\n\u201cConcluding based on the bit we are granted to see is dangerous and not fair on humanity. There are many ways we approach GOD and words we use based on our limited understanding but I know that by mercy, the state of the heart is understood\u2026\n\nIs it not by mercy that we can approach in the first place? Remember that I am a learner.\n\n\u201cON\u00cd\u00ccD\u00daR\u00d3 MI, \u1eb8 \u1e62\u00c9 OOOO! Mo d\u00fap\u1eb9\u0301!!\u201d",

The project is being done to raise fund for the organisation. It has nothing to do with the office of the First Lady,\u201d she explained.\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Raise Foundation, Mrs. Toyin Dawodu, told The Nation the facility is a sustainability project for the Raise Foundation and not a project for an individual.\n\n\u201cIt is a sustainability project for Raise Foundation. There is an empowerment arm to it, the tanker riders are being empowered by the water they sell.\n\n\u201cAfter each sale of a tanker of water, there is a percentage that goes to the rider, a percentage goes to maintaining the actual project and the third percentage goes into all the interventions done by the Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe project is for the NGO and not for an individual.

          "title": "Money, not sex, freaks me \u2013Angel Emeka, actress",
          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nGifted with the talent to crack jokes, Angel Emeka earned herself first movie role a few years ago, and since then she has not looked back.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, the single mother of two talked about her career, love, sex and marriage. Enjoy it.\n\nHow did you get into the movie industry?\n\nA costumier of mine who is a Nollywood script supervisor by name, Ebuka, may his soul rest in peace, came to my boutique with his friend, Chinedu Arinze, a location manager. They came to buy some stuff and I cracked them up, they laughed all day and told me that I can do well in the film industry. I laughed at them and had a flash back on what my mom always told me that she sees me as an actress in future, and since then I have always dreamt of it. So, I decided to give it a trial, and I went with them to the movie location in Asaba where they introduced me to a movie producer called, Solo Amaco, who gave me a role instantly to act with Joyce Kanu. I was so much scared of acting with her because that was my first time of meeting her, and I started crying due to the fear in me. But Madam Joyce Kanu noticed it was my first time and she consoled me and gave me the courage never to be scared. Being a market fight scene, she asked me to see her as my friend and fight her as if we\u2019re fighting for real, which I did in fear and the job came out well.\n\nHow was your growing up?\n\nGrowing up wasn\u2019t easy for my siblings and I, because we lost our dad at an early stage; but my mom is a strong woman. May God keep her for me!\n\nWhat was the first movie or series you acted in?\n\nThe first movie I acted in was Hour of Tears.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced when you first got into the industry?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to have a break when you\u2019re new because the producers and directors do not know how good you are. So, many of them find it very difficult to cast you in a movie, but I prayed for God\u2019s favour, which has been working for me till now.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve ever made for your career?\n\nMy kids and my business, I don\u2019t joke with these two. I love spending quality time with my kids and anyone that knows me very well will also tell you that I am a business tycoon and an entrepreneur, but my career has taken most of my time.\n\nHow many movies have you acted in so far?\n\nI can\u2019t recall exactly the number because I stopped counting six years ago.\n\nWhat current projects are you working on?\n\nI am working on my personal movie titled, Highlander, which is on post-production. I also finished a movie project, which I produced last month and it\u2019s currently airing on YouTube as we speak. The title is Village Jagaban.\n\nWhats your first experience in front of the camera, were you nervous?\n\nI wasn\u2019t nervous, because Joyce Kanu carried me along. But in my second movie, I was nervous because an actor made the set so uncomfortable for me. He shouted at me, saying I was not acting well, which made me cry like a baby. I ran to my car and went home because the shame was too much for me. However, the director made him to understand that I was new in the game and he felt bad, apologized and encouraged me to be stronger. Today, he is my bestie.\n\nWhat were you doing before this and what was the experience like?\n\nI was into importation of red wine, and boutique business. I was enjoying it because business is my thing as well.\n\nWhat was the turning point in your career?\n\nWhen I produced my first movies, Love From Panya and Dino`s Family.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI go for vacation with my kids, visit the zoo and chill with my girls.\n\nWhat quality or sexy part earned you your first movie role?\n\nIt\u2019s my Chinese baby face, bowlegs, hard work as well as my size. Amaco gave me the first role because of my body size. He needed someone big that can fight Joyce Kanu and I fitted into the character.\n\nWhich movie gave you the big break?\n\nAssembles of God and Ghetto University.\n\nMost men can hardly get their eyes off you; how do you cope with them?\n\nI end up making them my friends because we may end up doing businesses together. All my life I prefer making men my friends.\n\nWhat is the craziest thing a male fan or admirer has done to you?\n\nOne of my male fans poured chocolate ice cream on me while trying to take picture with me. It was fun, but crazy.\n\nHow do you intend to break into the A-list in this highly competitive industry?\n\nI\u2019m focused on my talent; with God by my side, I know I will get to the top.\n\nAs a soon-to-be-married actress, what is your stand on divorce?\n\nBroken marriages have nothing to do with the movie industry, just pray God to keep your home. Marriages break up on daily basis not only in Nollywood.\n\nIs marriage far or near for you?\n\nI now want to focus on my career because my first marriage wasn\u2019t fun and I am not fully healed.\n\nHave you said no to marriage proposal?\n\nYes, I\u2019ve said no to many because I am not ready for marriage yet.\n\nNow, how would you safeguard your next marriage?\n\nI will do everything possible to keep my marriage when the time comes. Marriage is sweet when you marry your man, a man that will love and endure you as his queen, and you respect and submit to him as your king.\n\nWhat does sex mean to you?\n\nSex means nothing to me because I am not a sex freak. I can stay for five years without sex, as long as my business is doing well and my kids are happy.\n\nThere are women who cannot get their eyes off a sexy lady like you; do you also have women that woo you?\n\nYes, but I don\u2019t give room to that madness.\n\nAre you in a relationship now?\n\nI am not in any relationship for now. I am still very much single. I am a single mother.\n\nWhat are the qualities you desire in a man?\n\nHe must be handsome, God-fearing, humble, loving, caring, and well dressed.\n\nHow do you handle sexual urge especially now that you\u2019re not in any relationship?\n\nI am not a sex freak; the only thing that freaks me is money.\n\nDo you have men asking you to be their second wife?\n\nYes, many times, but I believe in one man, one wife.\n\nCan you marry a man much older than you?\n\nNo! I don\u2019t like old men. When I was much younger, I had a bad experience that made me not to give any old man a chance to my heart. So, I don\u2019t see myself marrying someone much older than me except It\u2019s the will of God.\n\nHow would you advise young people who want to go into acting?\n\nThey should be focused and consistent because acting needs a lot of time if you really want to make it in the movie business.",

          "title": "NDDC board: What Niger Delta people want Buhari to do to Akpabio \u2014Comrade Joseph Evah",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nNational leader, Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Comrade Joseph Evah has warned that unless something serious is done to salvage the present state of insecurity in the country, there may not be any election in 2023.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, he also blamed the Southeast leaders for their latest culture of silence and fear as the major reason for the continued violence in the region.\n\nThe activist was also critical on the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s twitter handlers, as well as his lashes out the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, advocating for his sack.\n\nHe spoke on other national issues, including the recent constitution review exercise by the National Assembly with a verdict that nothing good will come out of it. Excerpt:\n\nLet\u2019s know the latest happening on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)?\n\nThe Niger Delta Ministry Minister, Godswill Akpabio is simply exhibiting madness, so we are following him up. He is the problem of NDDC, constituting stumbling block. Akpabio said we are frustrating them, he thought that NDDC is their political game centre so we are telling him that we have had enough of his arrogance. He went to Tompolo Gharamatu to go and beg him, he thought that Tompolo is someone that can be bribed because he believes that in Nigeria everybody has a price and bribable. No. Tompolo is not that type of person, he is one with credibility and integrity, that is why we have a lot of respect for him. What is the problem of Akpabio for not inaugurating the NDDC board? What is his problem? So, when he looks at the Niger Delta people he feels and thinks that he can put us in his pocket? When did he join politics? It is just like the way some of his former governor friends are behaving like drunkards. Look at the way some of them are behaving, common sense they don\u2019t have. It is disgracing. The problem is that most of them seem to forget their past, they forget where they are coming from and proscribed the memory of their past. In life anybody that forgets about his past when they get little opportunity you see them behaving like drunkards and you are going to leave the office one day, so why the arrogance? They seem to forget that power is transient, just temporary. When you leave the office is it not that same people you despised that you will meet again? Won\u2019t you come back for something else? We expect President Buhari to sack Akpabio quickly, if Akpabio will not face his Ministry of Niger Delta where there is no money to spend. But because of the type of money that the oil companies are giving to NDDC, Akpabio is focusing only on NDDC to build his own political jamboree in 2023, we will not allow it. The Ministry of Niger Delta is dead under Akpabio\u2019s watch, and he is not doing anything about it in Abuja. Because of the controversy in NDDC no money is going to NDDC from budgetary allocation. Akpabio is a confusionist and he should repent, but I expect the president to remove and replace him so that we can have peace. It is because of his gambling for 2023 that Akpabio is causing all this confusion.\n\nHow do you see the constitution review panels of the National Assembly?\n\nI do not see anything good or cheering coming out of it because our politicians are not sincere, if not for their insincerity and deceit something good should come out of it. Are they ready to let us have one chamber instead of this two chambers (House of Representatives and Senate) that we are wasting millions on? Which of them will be patriotic enough to say that this two chambers that we are operating, we are wasting so much money, that we should go back to our parliamentary system so as to save money? How many of the lawmakers are ready to sacrifice for their present positions now? They are ready for this wasteful system that is going on. I See what they are doing as mere jamboree because they are not sincere. Are you saying that they don\u2019t know our problem? Are you saying that they don\u2019t know that the system we are running is wasteful? But because they are benefitting from it themselves you will find out that they will not be genuinely committed to any serious review. Which of them will say: Let us go back to the parliamentary days, that we should have only one National Assembly, one chamber unlike this expensive nonsense we are practicing now. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are simply wasting money. Let us put that money in education. How many of them will suggest that? Let them start by examining themselves first. I don\u2019t see anything credible coming out of it and the reason as I said is simple. The people who are arranging it, managing it, midwifing it never won election in the first place, so they are alienated from their people. What the people want is not what they want. Can the National Assembly that we have today agree to go back to the parliamentary years so that we have one house (unicameral) making the law. Members of the National Assembly should start from themselves to get credibility and others will follow them and respect them. But for now, they are just wasting money, junketing the entire country, enjoying themselves in the hotels where they stay in the name of public hearing. I do not see any sincerity in what they are doing and I know I will be vindicated at last; nothing good will come out of it.\n\nWhat is your view on President Buhari\u2019s comment against the Southeast on Twitter, the removal of his tweet and the banning of Twitter in the country?\n\nI still think that our President\u2019s Twitter handlers should be more cautious on what they push out. You may find out that Buhari will not tweet such message on his own, sometimes the president is not aware of such tweets. There are many things they are doing in that Villa that the president is not aware of. His Twitter handlers need to exercise caution sometimes, seeing how the country is going volatile. There is need to manage any news, message, information coming from the presidential desk. I can tell you that the president was not aware of that tweet until his attention was drawn to it and they will start damage control. I think the president should caution those media aides that do those tweets with his name, they are taking so many things for granted, we should be sincere to ourselves. The president should caution those individuals who tweet things in his name that are not his ideology, individuals who create imaginary problems for him where there is none. The president I can tell you is not aware, I am not saying may not be aware, but that he was not aware of that tweet because he would not allow it. It is like what Akpabio is doing in the Niger Delta, he will just go and tell one of the personal assistants to the president that this is the thinking of the Niger Delta people and they will be pushing the agenda even without the president knowing. There is so mush deceit over there that a lot is outside the knowledge of Mr. President. They do not have access to the president\u2019s bedroom, but they know people who have such access, those are the people they go and lobby and they come out to say that the president said this and that when in truth the president is in the dark on those issues. Do you think President Buhari will tell the Attorney General to go and start comparing herdsmen with Igbo spare parts dealers? Can you imagine that logic in this 21st Century? If we are in a sane society that minister is supposed to resign. For that minister to open his mouth to compare bandits, herdsmen that are killing people, even in their own area, raping women among other atrocities and you compare them with spare parts dealers, such thinking is worrisome. When you see some of these things you begin to ask yourself, is this still the country that Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa, Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe etc, founded? Some of the things we hear and see these days about Nigeria are disturbing and you begin to ask yourself, how did we get here.\n\nI know you are aware of the massive support that former Lagos State governor and national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is getting with the formation of SWAGA (Southwest Agenda for Asiwaju). What is your take on the development?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with it. They can go on with their massive support for him. He has the right to contest. I know a lot of people seem to be looking at the Southeast, but their political leaders and elders must rise up to the occasion of what is going on there now, the orgy of killings, the violence, destructions etc and stop it. What is going on in the Southeast is a signal, those who are sponsoring them are saying: Don\u2019t mention Southeast for the presidency in 2023, that is the signal. Those who are sponsoring destruction of police stations, burning of INEC offices, destruction of prisons, killing of policemen and other security agencies have a terrible agenda and the elders and political leaders in the Southeast are simply watching, keeping silent. This their new culture of silence and fear is not doing them any good. What are we saying? Are we saying that there is no leadership in the Southeast to stop this carnage, the self-destruction that is going on? Are you saying there is no political leadership and elders that can stop what is happening in the Southeast? When you are burning INEC offices and materials what will you use to conduct election? People that have committed crime and facing punishment you go and release them, why? I hope that the Southeast leaders should sit down and know that the signal is very clear and very dangerous for their political future. The Southeast leaders should investigate what is happening, the Yoruba are doing it. They should stop relying on conspiracy theory and folding their hands. Why can\u2019t they rise up to investigate what is happening? So, even if it is coming from the outside you fold your hands until the police do their investigation? No, they should open their eyes and track down what is happening, they should do their own thorough investigation too to compare with whatever other investigation that will be done either by the police or whoever. Igbo leaders have to arrest the situation, it is not something that they should wait for anybody to come and do for them. What is happening there is unacceptable. If there are saboteurs expose them, nobody will take any excuse on what is happening there because the Igbo must put their house in order. They must call a spade a spade, saying that outsiders are doing it, it is a fake cry, nobody will listen to such excuse; they have to unravel what is happening there. A political zone with not less than five states and the elders, governors, political leaders, senators cannot sit down and say: we must do something to stop this carnage. Even if what is happening is coming from the outside they can, with unity among them resist and stop it. You cannot be there and your environment, your heritage is being destroyed and you are talking of conspiracy theory, you are keeping silent. Are those people doing the destruction spirits? Igbo leadership must swing into action to unravel what is happening if they are serious. And they have the capacity to do it if they want to.\n\nBut you know that orders come from Abuja as far as security issues are concerned?\n\nSo, if Abuja did not respond or yet to respond you wait until you die waiting for Abuja? Look, every community in Nigeria has vigilante, every street has vigilante group, and wherever people are living they have a vigilante group. And we are aware even from reports from the social media of the vigilante in Igbo land which they are boasting off. If you go to Asaba area and see the vigilante group there you will fear, go to Delta North and see the powerful vigilante groups that people from Governor Okowa area has set up, beyond the Nigeria Police Force. In those areas people are contributing money from everywhere, from abroad, to sustain it for their security. Look, I am worried that if this security challenge remains this way there will be a big challenge with conducting any election. As I speak, you cannot travel from Bayelsa to Warri, you cannot travel to anywhere without being afraid, bandits are everywhere. I don\u2019t see the 2023 election taking place from the insecurity that is on now. Do you know the curfew that is in Rivers State? Rivers State is worse than Abia. We are praying that Rivers State problem does not extend to Bayelsa and the riverine areas. Poverty is coming, food is not moving round again because of the insecurity. As we speak now students are still in captivity. I am an educationist, why will I be happy to hear that children are still in captivity. In the house when I look at my daughter I imagine that somebody\u2019s daughter is still in captivity for one month. What is happening in the country is frightening. What are the Imams and the pastors telling our leaders who are members of their congregations? They should stop them from entering the mosques and churches. Let there be ushers on the ground that will be driving them away.",

          "title": "Anxiety as Nigeria\u2019s debt burden hits N32.9 trillion",
          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock currently pegged at N32.915 trillion (as at December 31, 2020), many are worried that the country is being boxed into a debt trap it may never wriggle out from in decades to come.\n\nThe figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nAccording to economic experts, plausible reasons for the swell in the external debts include lower oil prices, disproportionate spending, COVID-19, defence of the exchange rate, over-reliance on crude oil receipts (with all its volatilities) and poor economic diversification agenda, among others.\n\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\n\nThis period corresponds with the Presidency of Buhari, who assumed leadership of the country on May 29, 2015.\n\nAccording to the statistics, Nigeria\u2019s total debt as at June 30, 2015 stood at N12.12 trillion.\n\nHowever, by December 31, 2020, the country\u2019s debt portfolio had risen to N32.92 trillion.\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s debt was N12.6 trillion. It rose to N17.4 trillion in 2016 and then N21.7 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s debt had climbed to N24.4 trillion. It ballooned to N27.1 in 2019 and finally N32.915 trillion as at December 31 last year.\n\nThis shows that within a period of 66 months (five and half years), the country\u2019s debt grew by N20.8 trillion.\n\nIt also means that within the period, the country\u2019s debt portfolio rose by 171.62 per cent.\n\nDomestic sources accounted for N20.21 trillion, while external sources accounted for N12.71 trillion.\n\nIn percentage terms, external debts accounted for 38.6 per cent of the total debt portfolio while domestic debts accounted for 61.4 per cent.\n\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\n\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\n\nWhile servicing local debts gulped N8.53 trillion between July 2015 and December 2020, servicing external debts gulped N1.72 trillion from 2016 to December 2020 (external debt servicing converted to naira at the exchange rate prevailing at the time, provided by the DMO).\n\nThe data provided by the DMO showed that from July to December 2015, N489.59 billion was spent on servicing local debts.\n\nFrom January to December, a total of N1.23 trillion was spent to service the country\u2019s domestic debts in 2016. The figure rose to N1.48 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the country\u2019s domestic debt servicing bill rose to N1.8 trillion. The cost of domestic debt servicing came down a bit in 2019 to N1.69 trillion. In 2020, it rose again to N1.85 trillion.\n\nOn the other hand, external debt servicing consumed $353.09 million in 2016. It went up to $464.05 million in 2017 and jumped up to $1.47 billion in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, the nation spent $1.33 billion on external debt servicing. In 2020, external debt servicing gulped $1.56 billion.\n\nTo rescue the country from the thorny situation, President Buhari has been going cap in hand begging for debt relief for the country at different international fora, but without success thus far.\n\nHis efforts mimic those of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in 2006, when she led Nigeria and the Paris Club to seal a final agreement for debt relief worth $18 billion and an overall reduction of Nigeria\u2019s debt stock by $30 billion.\n\nOn his part, the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele has called on the state governors to wean themselves off the addiction to loans and monthly federal subvention by investing heavily in agriculture, especially in crops they have comparative advantage. With that, they can help solve the food insecurity nightmare and go into massive exports to pay their debts and build prosperity for their respective states.\n\nThe rise in the country\u2019s debt servicing reflected the nation\u2019s increasing commitment to external loans.\n\nThe debt accumulation is coming at a time when key government officials in the Economic Management Team have repeatedly defended the country\u2019s debt level, arguing that it is still within sustainable limits.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed has severally insisted that Nigeria does not have a debt problem.\n\nAccording to her, what the government needed to do was to increase its revenue generating capacity in order to boost revenue to about 50 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\n\u201cNigeria does not have a debt problem. What we have is a revenue problem.\n\n\u201cOur revenue to GDP is still one of the lowest among countries that are comparable to us. It\u2019s about 19 per cent of GDP and what the World Bank and IMF recommended is about 50 per cent of GDP for countries that are our size. We are not there yet. What we have is a revenue problem\u201d, she posited at a recent Finance Summit.\n\nHowever, the Finance Minister\u2019s position differs with that of some economic experts who said that the huge borrowings portend danger for the economy.\n\nFor instance, a Chartered Accountant, Mr Ezekiel Ifeanyi said the Federal Government\u2019s current fiscal position constrains it from embarking on such huge expenditure as a result of accumulated large deficits over the past few years.\n\nHe said that the huge debt remains a burden for the economy, adding that time has come for Nigeria to begin to seek debt relief from its creditors.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\n\u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escaping from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn\u201d, Ezekiel stated.\n\nAlso, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, at a virtual conference organised by Elombah Television in 2020, warned that with the rise in the country\u2019s debt service to revenue ratio, Nigeria was heading towards a sovereign debt crisis.\n\nHe noted that the terms and conditions attached to the Chinese loans were not favourable to Nigeria.\n\nThe former presidential candidate canvassed public private partnership (PPP) as the best and sustainable way to fund strategic infrastructure projects.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number one problem is not just Nigeria\u2019s loan to China, but it is the broader external indebtedness. Nigeria is essentially walking into a sovereign debt crisis.\n\n\u201cWhen you consider that we now spend virtually all that we earn servicing foreign debt.\n\n\u201cIn the first quarter of 2020, the Federal Government\u2019s total revenue was about N950 billion, but we spent N943 billion servicing external debt, which was about 99 per cent. Is a country on this path fiscally viable?\n\n\u201cWe are taking more and more of these loans and we are told by the Debt Management Office (DMO) that our debt to GDP ratio is under control and is below 30 per cent, and that it does not matter.\u201d\n\nHe explained that 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s revenue \u201cis from crude oil. So, when those revenues are plunging, then that is a huge risk because your debt obligations are fixed.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is such a serious mismatch between what you are earning and what you have to pay those you are owing, then you have a crisis. And that is the real problem for Nigeria today with its loan from China.\u201d\n\nThe bulk of Nigeria\u2019s lenders are offshore corporations, with China being Nigeria\u2019s biggest creditor.\n\nNigeria has agreed $5.6 billion in loans with China. But as of March 2020, Beijing had disbursed $3.3 billion. With Nigeria already servicing the loans, $3.1 billion was outstanding as at then.\n\nHowever, commenting on the rising debt, the DMO explained that it was not an entirely gloomy situation. It noted that after Nigeria exited recession in 2017, the level of new borrowing at the federal level, as shown in the annual Appropriation Acts, had been declining as part of the government\u2019s measures to moderate the rate of growth in the public debt stock in order to ensure debt sustainability.\n\nThe DMO added that new borrowing to part-finance budget deficits had declined steadily from N2.36 trillion in 2017 to N2.01 trillion in 2018. It was N1.61 trillion in 2019 and N1.59 trillion in the 2020 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cThis trend was reversed in 2020 due to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as new borrowing in the revised 2020 Appropriation Act was N4.20 trillion. Many countries including the advanced countries also increased their level of borrowing as a result of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted though, that apart from the new domestic borrowing of N2.3 trillion, the other new borrowings were concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund ($3.34 billion) and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.\n\n\u201cThis incremental borrowing to part-finance the 2020 budget and the additional issuance of promissory notes to settle some arrears of the Federal Government of Nigeria, contributed to the increase in public debt stock. New domestic borrowings by state governments also contributed to the growth in the public debt stock.\n\n\u201cTotal public debt to GDP as at December 31, 2020 was 21.61 per cent which is within Nigeria\u2019s new limit of 40 per cent. The various initiatives of the government to increase revenues such as the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative and the Finance Act, 2020, should help shore up government\u2019s revenue and reduce the debt service to revenue ratio\u201d, the DMO explained.\n\nBut amid fears of Nigeria\u2019s high debt exposure to China, the DMO reassured that there was nothing to panic about as the loans were concessional with interest rates of 2.50 per cent per annum, tenor of 20 years and a moratorium of seven years.\n\nIt added that the communist country was not a major source of funding for the Federal Government, despite the fact that total borrowing from China, as at March 31, 2020, stood at $3.121 billion or N1,126.68 trillion using the N361/$1 conversion template.\n\nThe DMO ruled out the possibility of China taking possession of the projects financed by them if Nigeria defaults in servicing the loan.\n\nThe DMO emphasized that Nigeria explicitly provides for debt service on its external and domestic debt in its annual budgets, adding that a number of the projects being (and to be) financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue.\n\nIt added that the $3.121 billion Chinese debt represents only 3.94 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total public debt of $79.303 billion (N28,628.49 trillion at $1/N361) as at March 31, 2020.\n\nDMO said: \u201cSimilarly, in terms of external sources of funds, loans from China accounted for 11.28 per cent of the external debt stock of $27.67 billion at the same date.\n\n\u201cThese data show that China is not a major source of funding for the Nigerian government.\n\nThe terms of the loans are compliant with the provisions of Section 41 (1a) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. In addition, the low interest rate reduces the interest cost to the government, while the long tenor enables the repayment of the principal sum of the loans over many years.\n\n\u201cThese two benefits make the provisions for debt service in the annual budget lower than they would otherwise have been if the loans were on commercial terms\u201d.\n\nThe DMO further explained that the $3.121 billion Chinese loans are project-tied facilities.\n\nIt listed the 11 projects as; Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Idu-Kaduna section), Abuja Light Rail Project, Nigerian Four Airport Terminals Expansion Project, (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt), Nigerian Railway Modernization Project (Lagos-Ibadan section) and Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Abuja \u2013 Keffi- Makurdi Road Project.\n\nIt further noted that the impact of these loans is not only evident but visible. For instance, the Idu \u2013 Kaduna rail line has become a major source of transportation between Abuja and Kaduna. Also, the new International Airport in Abuja, has improved air transportation for the populace, while the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan rail line when completed, will ease traffic on the busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway.\n\n\u201cThe projects also have the added benefits of job creation, not only by themselves but through direct and indirect service providers, a number of which are Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt is widely accepted that investment in infrastructure is one of the most effective tools for countries to achieve economic growth and development. Using Loans from China to finance infrastructure is thus in alignment with this position.\n\n\u201cThe principal process and requirements for borrowing by the government are expressly stated in the Debt Management Office Establishment (ETC) Act, 2003 (DMO Act) and the Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2007. Section 21 (1) of the DMO Act, \u2018No External loan shall be approved or obtained by the Minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution\u2019 and Section 41 (1a) of the FRA, \u2018Government at all tiers shall only borrow for capital expenditure and human development, provided that, such borrowing shall be on concessional terms with low interest rate and with a reasonable long amortization period subject to the approval of the appropriate legislative body where necessary\u2019, are instructive in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning works with the MDAs under whose portfolio a proposed loan falls and also with the DMO. Thereafter, the approval of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) is sought. It is only after the approval by FEC that His Excellency requests for the approval of the National Assembly as required by Section 41 of the Fiscal responsibility Act, 2007. More importantly, it is only after the approval of NASS that the loans are taken and Nigeria begins to draw down on the loans.\n\n\u201cThe loan agreements are reviewed by legal officers of the Federal Ministry of Justice and the Legal Opinion of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is obtained before any External Loan Agreement is signed\u201d, the DMO added.\n\nCommenting on Nigeria\u2019s ballooning debt profile, Nigeria\u2019s first professor of the Capital Markets and former Imo State Finance Commissioner, Prof Uche Uwaleke explained that the crash in revenue generation always leads the Nigerian government to borrow.\n\n\u201cThe way forward is to make conscious efforts to have multiple streams of income, including through embracing the private sector to develop the enabling environment for this to happen. The economy has remained vulnerable to external shocks due to inability to hugely diversify revenue sources.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, the economy went into recession twice since 2015 owing in part to fall in crude oil prices and the forex challenge that came with the two cycles.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, there is no evidence to suggest that the bulk of the borrowing has gone into self-liquidating capital projects. A major cause of naira depreciation is the huge forex spent importing petroleum products in a period of rising crude oil prices. The huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.\n\n\u201cThe lasting solution is to create multiple sources of forex via export diversification and to curtail demand through import substitution and patronizing locally made products\u201d, he stated.\n\nBut the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Ita Enang, said at a recent Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria 2021 Fellow Conferment ceremony in Lagos, that Nigeria was adopting the best practices of sustainable debt management.\n\nAccording to him, the repayment plan of the debt is tied to the projects for which the loan is taken.\n\nThe presidential aide noted that \u201call the terms and conditions of the loans are laid before the National Assembly and approved in detail before execution.\n\n\u201cThis is to avoid the terms being approved by the National Assembly after the loan agreement must have been executed. A number of projects being and to be financed by the loans are either revenue generating or have the potential to generate revenue\u201d.\n\nThe above assertion notwithstanding, experts insist there is a need for Nigeria to build revenue to have more space to spend for infrastructure, social safety nets and others. This is to avoid interest on the loans eating up the bulk of the revenue.",
          "summary": "The figure, released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), includes local and external debt of the federal, state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\nBetween July 2015 when President Muhammadu and December 2020, Nigeria\u2019s debt rose by approximately N20.8 trillion, according to the DMO.\nThe country\u2019s increasing debt profile is also reflected in the growing cost of debt servicing which has further depleted the nation\u2019s dwindling revenues in recent years.\nWithin the period of 66 months under review, the country spent N10.26 trillion on debt servicing.\nThe huge cost of servicing external debt is also a drain on external reserves.",

          "title": "COVID-19 2nd jab: Fear as first batch of AstraZeneca vaccine expires in few weeks",
          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, this year, Nigeria took delivery of four million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said to be the first batch of expected vaccines, preparatory to vaccination exercise in Nigeria.\n\nThis was after several \u201cdelays\u201d and shift in arrival date, perhaps due to failed logistics arrangements or other unforeseen circumstances that elongated the arrival of the vaccines.\n\nGAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with the help UNICEF was said to had faciliated the procurement and shipping of the vaccine.\n\nOn Friday, March 5, the vaccination exercise was flagged off in Abuja. This was after the National Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) had certified the vaccine safe for use.\n\nA brief ceremony to herald the commencement of the exercise was held at the Trauma Centre, National Hospital, Abuja, with impressive representation of the officials of the Federal Government and other stakeholders.\n\nAt about 11:05 a.m, Dr. Cyprian Ngong, a family physician, Senior Registrar at National Hospital, Abuja, was administered the first dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, marking the historic commencement of COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria.\n\nExecutive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, administered the vaccine to Dr. Ngong, who was deeply appreciated for giving his best professionally to COVID-19 patients at one of the isolation centres in Abuja.\n\nThereafter, vaccination began across the states. Several parameters were used to distribute the vaccines to states, and that include adequate maintenance of cold chain storage facilities, transportation of logistics to the ward/ health facility, adequate security during transportation and at vaccination sites, completion of training of health workers, efficient social mobilization activities in place, as well as adherence to protocol for vaccine deployment.\n\nData from the national call-in dash board domiciled at the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) indicated that as at June 6, when the administration of the first dose of vaccines ended, 1,966,128 million persons were vaccinated. Lagos State led with 313, 433 persons vaccinated. FCT, Kano and Kaduna states followed with 132,483; 95,963; 92,999 people vaccinated, respectively.\n\nData, however, obtained from the NPHCDA indicated that second dose of the vaccination begun immediately, after about four months.\n\nAs at June 6, data from NPHCDA vaccination dash board indicated that 336,501 had received their second jab.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s fear and anxiety on the ability of the vaccines reaching clients before its expiration.\n\nThere are indications that millions of doses of the vaccine in the first batch of consignment will expire in few weeks, precisely, June 28 and July 9, respectively.\n\nNPHCDA Executive Director, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, was quoted to have confirmed at the National media briefing of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 recently that the AstraZeneca vaccine will expire soon\n\nHe said: \u201cThe batches of AstraZeneca we received some months ago have expiring dates of June and July, respectively. Howbeit, vaccination again is ongoing in all states of the federation. Our collaboration with health officials and other stakeholders at the national, state, and community levels in the vaccination exercise has yielded substantial results.\u201d\n\nHe also said there would be delay in the arrival of another consignment of the vaccines which may also affect and impact the remaining phases of the vaccination campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, a credible source at the PSC hinted that procurement of another batch of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not in the plan of the Federal Government, rather the government is considering Johnson and Johnson (J&J) vaccine because of cost, storage facilities and other unique features.\n\nRecall that NAFDAC, few weeks ago, confirmed J&J COVID-19 vaccine safe for use in Nigeria, after a report by its vaccine committee confirmed that data on the vaccine were robust and met criteria for efficacy, safety and quality.\n\nNAFDAC boss, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, had noted that most commonly reported side effects of the J&J vaccine are pain at injection site, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea, and most of the side effects are mild to moderate in severity and last for one to two days.\n\nShe said the data also showed that the vaccine\u2019s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks thereby supporting the manufacturer\u2019s recommended use.\n\nShe confirmed that the J&J vaccine is administered as a single dose as against the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that is administered twice to confirm its efficacy, adding that the results from a clinical trial involving people in the United States, South Africa and Latin American countries found that the vaccine was effective at preventing COVID-19 in people from 18 years of age.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe phase III clinical trial involved over 44,000 people. Half of them received a single dose of the vaccine and half were given placebo (a dummy injection). Many of them did not know if they were given J&J COVID-19 vaccine or placebo.\n\n\u201cThe trial found a 67 per cent reduction in the number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases after two weeks in people who received J&J COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe explained that J&J COVID-19 vaccine works by preparing the body to defend itself against COVID-19, and an unopened vaccine vials can be stored and/or transported frozen at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C for up to 24 months and three months when stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Ngong, who was the first to take AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine said that he took the second dose of the vaccine after 10 weeks, and he had no reaction.",

          "title": "Legislature, Judiciary Paralysed in Nigeria, Says Afe Babalola",
          "text": "\u2022Explains N\u2019Assembly has power to give Nigeria a new constitution\n\n\u2022Posits an amendment includes substitution\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi and Victor Olakitan in Ado-Ekiti\n\nA renowned Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and founder, Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti (ABUAD), Chief Afe Babalola, has said the current state of the nation presents a democracy with a paralysed legislature and judiciary, thus defeating the very essence of democracy as the most viable system of government.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with THISDAY, the legal luminary and businessman, who reckoned that Nigeria was yet to have an ideal democracy given that scenario, argued that the National Assembly has the power to give Nigeria a brand new constitution contrary to the position of NASS leadership. \u201cLet me say that it was totally wrong for the National Assembly to say they cannot produce or write a new constitution. Under the 1999 Constitution, the National Assembly can produce a new constitution. One, the 1999 Constitution gave the National Assembly the power to amend. In its broad interpretation, an amendment includes substitution.\n\nThey can exercise their powers and say the 1999 Constitution needs a substitution. They gave a narrow interpretation to the amendment clause. This same process was undertaken in Sudan and many other countries. All the National Assembly needed to do is to call for a conference where people will advise on where and how the 1999 constitution can be substituted. That is all.\u201d\n\nBabalola also spoke on the recent Twitter row with the federal government, and posited that President Muhammadu Buhari erred by his decision to suspend the operations of the microblogging giant in the country.\n\nAnswering to a question on the autonomy of the judiciary, which had prompted a strike by judicial workers for over two months, Babalola said, \u201cDemocracy thrives on three fundamentals pillars \u2013 the executive, legislature and judiciary. If a man with two legs has one of its legs cut off, will he be able to move freely?\n\n\u201cBut out of the three arms we have, two have been paralysed. I mean the legislature and judiciary. Do we now say we have a democracy? Where can people ventilate their anger? Do they want them to resort to self-help? There can be no fairness and justice, where the executive continues to pay those in the judiciary.\u201d\n\nSupporting his claims, the Ekiti-born lawyer, noted: \u201cI have been in the legal practice for 60 years or thereabouts. I knew how our courts were when I came back to the country from England in the early 60s. Then, we had lawyers from Ghana, West Indies and many other countries competing with us in the Nigerian courts. So, it was very competitive. In my 60 years of practice, however, Nigerian courts have never been shut for a day. Even in those days, lawyers and judges were respected.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget the aphorism that says he who pays the piper dictates the tune. Commonsense dictates that there should be independence for legislature and judiciary. If the car of a judge breaks down and he only relies on a president or governor to get it fixed, then, it will be difficult for him to pass a judgment that will be against the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the process of recruiting members of the Bench in Nigeria, he said,\n\n\u201cThat is critical. But we have not got it right. A practice, whereby people are asked to apply to become a judge, is affecting the system. The process cannot guarantee fairness and justice. After filing the application, the governor will now decide, who to pick among them. In those days, people did not need to apply to become judges.\n\n\u201cIt is the system itself that looks for qualified men of integrity to become judges. That is part of the rot in our system. I believe that the judiciary must not only be autonomous, but also the courts must be accessible and open to all. The president and governors, as high as they are, are equal before the courts. That is the beauty of it.\u201d\n\nOn the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria, Babalola said, \u201cI do not believe the president was right to have given the directive just because Twitter removed his post about the security in the Southeast. Don\u2019t forget that the English law we are operating presumes that you are innocent until the court proves otherwise.\n\n\u201cTwitter, like human beings, has the right to suspend Buhari\u2019s personal account in this context. The president cannot be a judge in his own case. If he felt wronged by what Twitter did, what he ought to have done is to approach the court of law, which has power of adjudication. He cannot jail Twitter for removing his comment. Only the court has such powers and not the president.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "June 12: Nigerians Stage Protests Nationwide",
          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nNigerians yesterday staged protests and rallies around the country to mark the second anniversary of declaration June 12 as Democracy Day and protest the state of affairs in the country.\n\nAnd in what has been widely condemned as double standard, the Nigeria Police, yesterday, protected and permitted pro-President Muhammadu Buhari campaigners to hold a solidarity rally in Abuja without any form of harassment, while at the same time disrupting the rallies organised by anti-Buhari groups in many parts of the country, using teargas.\n\nA mega rally organised for the president by his supporters, who trooped to Unity Fountain in Maitama, Abuja, to celebrate Democracy Day, was populated by dozens of youths drawn from the Youth Coalition for Development (YCD). They closed a section of the Shehu Shagari Road to traffic.\n\nInterestingly, there was heavy security in place, including a helicopter, which hovered above to protect those at the rally convened by Aminu Aminu.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to the riotous atmosphere at the Gudu area of Abuja, where activists, led by Omoyele Sowore, who were opposed to the Buhari administration, clashed with policemen who were sent to disperse them with teargas. The police also dispersed anti-Buhari marchers in other parts of the country, like Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abeokuta,\n\nBut the Federal Capital Territory Police Command justified its decision to disperse the anti-government protesters.\n\nMany of those who showed up for the solidarity procession for the president were clad in branded white T-shirts with the inscription, \u201cI Stand With Buhari, How about You?\u201d boldly on the shirts. They also held placards bearing messages, like \u201c#IStandwithBuhari\u201d, \u201cWe are Indivisible\u201d, \u201cWe stay as one, We are Nigeria!\u201d\n\nOne of the president\u2019s supporters also carried a declarative message that read: \u201cProtest is only about getting your voice heard not a means of changing the government\u201d.\n\nSpeaking with reporters at the rally, the organiser said the solidarity march was put together in recognition of the efforts of many people, who campaigned and laboured to institute a culture of democracy in the country since 1993. He lauded Buhari for recognising the importance of the day.\n\nAminu said, \u201cJune 12 is a watershed in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s democratic history. It is a day to celebrate the beginning of a consistent and ideological struggle that eventually gave birth to a foundation for the democratic renaissance Nigeria is now building.\u201d\n\nBut, earlier, the police teargased a group protesting at the Gudu area of the Federal Capital Territory. Sowore, the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, led the protesters comprising many youths and middle-aged persons. They said they were gathered to protest against the prevailing insecurity in the country.\n\nThe anti-Buhari rally began about 8.30am and was peaceful until the police stormed the area and started firing teargas to disperse the rally. The Gudu road was also cordoned off while traffic flow was disrupted as a result.\n\nThe development forced the protesters, who carried placards bearing inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari must go\u201d, \u201cSay no to injustice\u201d, \u201c33.3% Unemployment Rate is Criminal\u201d, \u201d Digital Right is Human Right\u201d, to scamper to safety.\n\nThe FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, in a statement said policemen had to disperse the protesters to prevent members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others from \u201cinciting public disturbance.\u201d Mariam added that calm had been restored around the axis and said nobody was arrested.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cFCT Police foils attempt to incite public disturbance, disperse members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others\u201d, Mariam stated, \u201cThe FCT Police Command on Saturday, June 12, 2021, successfully restored calm at Apo-Gudu axis after professionally dispersing a protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria \u2013 Shiites and others targeted at inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the action of the command was necessitated by the concerns of some agitated residents. However, no arrest was made.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the command wishes to state that it is committed to ensuring that FCT residents enjoy a hitch-free Democracy Day celebration and will not hesitate to bring to book every person or entity that attempts to breach the peace or cause a breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe command implores residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.\u201d\n\nIn Yola, the Adamawa State capital, residents staged a protest and demanded a revolution to change the present leadership of Buhari, citing incompetence in handing the country\u2019s affairs. The protesters, who came under the banner of #Buharimustgo, defied a heavy rainfall and continued their protest for about three hours, demanding good governance and a leader who would pull Nigeria out of its numerous challenges. They also called on Buhairi to relinquish power, brandishing banners of #revolutionnow, which asked Buhari to quit immediately.\n\nSporting black T-shirts marked with inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d, the protesters chanted, \u201cFreedom comes by struggle\u201d and maintained, \u201cwe must come together to salvage our nation\u201d.\n\nLeader of the group, Tony Sudan Gompwel, told journalists that Buhari and other political leaders had failed the country.\n\nGompwel stated, \u201cThe kind of political leaders we have in our nation cannot give us the desired change.\u201d He said bad leadership was the reason the country was bedevilled by insecurity and economic backwardness.\n\n\u201cThey are hardened, they are tyrants, they are bankrupt of ideas. That\u2019s why great Nigerian youths are converging all over the nation to demand that they should leave the stage,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHowever, while the protest against the Buhari administration subsisted, his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Adamawa State read out Buhari\u2019s scorecard to residents to mark the second year of designating June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, who was represented by Honourable Abdulrazask Namdas, commended the Buhari administration. Namdas, a member representing Jada, Ganye, Toungo and Mayobelwa Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, said the celebration was also to intimate the citizens of the performance of the APC in the state.\n\nAt the event held at Muna Hotel, Yola, to mark the June 12 celebration, the scorecards of all serving senators and House of Representatives members from the state, and that of Buhari, were read out.\n\nAdamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri praised the courage and desire of the citizenry to allow democracy thrive after two decades of uninterrupted process.\n\nFintiri, in a press release by his Press Secretary, Mr. Humwashi Wonosikou, commended the electorate for trusting him with their mandate.\n\nThe governor said in the release, \u201cWe will continue to ensure we keep to our promise \u2013 a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our values of opportunity, responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their lives in a difficult period made worse by the dwindling economic hardship.\n\n\u201cOur desire to strengthen democracy and give it its true meaning informed the investment we are making in the social reengineering of the state through the provision of infrastructure and human capital development needed to unlock the growth and development of the Adamawa of our dream. The projects spread across the state represent the value and meaning of Democracy Day.\u201d\n\nIn Lagos, it was quiet in most parts of the state even though there were reports of skirmishes between protesters and men of the Nigerian Police at the Gani Fawehinmi Park at Ojota.\n\nAt the Mile Two area of the state also, there were reports of violent confrontations, which were promptly quelled by security operatives.\n\nHowever, all was peaceful in known flashpoints in the state, like Oshodi, Ojodu-Berger, Ojuelegba, Fagba, and Ketu, as many residents celebrated the June 12 Democracy Day in their homes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that although the protesters at Gani Fawehinmi Park were peaceful initially, it was the attempt by the police to forcibly disperse them from the venue that resulted in a face-off, leading to the use of teargas by the police. There were no reports of casualties or injuries.\n\nThere were no reports of breakdown of law and order in any other part of the state, even though many businesses were closed.\n\nIn Iju, Agege, Ojodu, Ikeja, Abule Egba, and Ogba areas, many people were indoors as commercial buses also stayed off roads.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that security was normal in most of these places, as no policemen and other security agents were noticed on the streets, and traffic was light.\n\nSpeaking on the conduct of the police, human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, said even though he had to go and effect the release of some youths arrested by the police, he was glad that there were no reports of killings. He said the situation was remarkably better than the previous months.\n\nFalana alleged that last year, the Nigeria Police had no canister of teargas to quell protests, hence their resort to the use of live bullets, as happened during the #EndSARS protest.\n\nFalana, who spoke at the 25th Anti-Corruption Situation Room organised by the Heda Resources Centre, disclosed that it was the lack of the teargas canisters that led to the killing of 99 persons during the October 2020 protest.\n\nIn Edo State, protesters called on the federal government to deliver good governance and adequate security, stating that the ineptitude of Buhari has brought Nigeria to its knees. The protesters, who began their match at King Square (Ring Road), Benin City, were provided security by the police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, and the state vigilante group. They accompanied the protesters to the Government House, where the Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu, received them.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of about seven groups of protesters and civil society organisations, Marxist Kola Edokpayi of the Talakawa Assembly, lamented that the nonchalant attitude of the president towards security of life and property had brought the country to its present unacceptable situation.\n\nEdokpayi said, \u201cThe ineptitude of President Buhari has brought us to this sorry state. His nonchalant attitude has caused a lot of security problems. It has been difficult to combat Boko Haram, banditry and kidnapping. Nigerians now live in fear and nobody knows what will happen next.\n\n\u201cWhat we now hear is \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 who are killing people in the South-east, while other parts of the country are becoming unsafe to live in because of insecurity. The prices of goods and services are moving up daily beyond the reach of the common man.\u201d\n\nResponding, the deputy governor commended the protesters for conducting themselves peacefully and promised that all their grievances would be channelled to the right quarters.\n\nShaibu used the opportunity to speak on some political issues in the state. He said of the 14 state lawmakers whose seats were declared vacant, \u201cWe did everything possible to have them in the House but they decided to follow a godfather, who misled them. Even with a month until their seats would be declared vacant, we urged them to join the assembly but they were asking for a second proclamation.\n\n\u201cThey also went to court and that had stopped the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting a fresh election. The INEC has said no new election can be conducted until the cases are decided. So, we have to wait for the courts before the next move can be made.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, governors and prominent Nigerians across the country, yesterday, spoke on the second anniversary of June 12 as Democracy Day, focusing on the swirling frustrations in different parts of the country.\n\nKWARA\n\nGovernor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State says the country has made progress despite its current challenges, which include the challenges of nation building, population bulge, and insecurity. In a statement issued in Ilorin on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, to commemorate June 12, the governor said, \u201cI felicitate with Kwarans, and, indeed, all Nigerians, on this day of June 12, which has come to symbolise the struggle of our people for human rights, participatory democracy, and development.\n\n\u201cWhatever the challenges of nation-building confronting our fatherland, the truth is that we are pacing ahead in all indices of development while institutions of democracy are growing stronger and getting more mature.\u201d\n\nGOMBE\n\nThe Gombe State governor, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya, yesterday, praised Nigerians for resolving to maintain democracy as the means of governance, saying 22 years of interrupted democratic rule has proven naysayers wrong. Yahaya said Nigeria\u2019s \u201cdemocratic maturity has shattered the myths about African democracy being under the grip of one single leader or political party.\u201d\n\nHe noted that as the largest country in Africa, Nigeria would continue to hold the torch of nation building, democratic pluralism, and political stability in Africa and the world at large.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of uninterrupted democracy, I make bold to say Nigeria\u2019s democracy has come of age. We have witnessed successful transitions of power from one administration to the next, and from one political party to another,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nBAUCHI\n\nBauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, saluted the courage and patriotism of all democrats \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 who strived to ensure that democracy was well grounded in the country.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the governor said, \u201cWe laboured together to arrive where we are today and we shall continue to march the state forward to greatness with determination and sincerity of purpose with your support and prayers.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who explained that his two-year journey in power had not been a bed of roses, added, \u201cBut with determination and the support enjoyed from the good people of the state, we were able to pilot the affairs of government to a sound socio-political pedestal.\u201d\n\nEKITI\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, urged Nigerians to be more determined in ensuring that democracy worked in the country. Fayemi said despite its imperfections, democracy remained the best option for the country, adding that through the determination of the citizens and their active participation in the democratic process, Nigerians can achieve a truly great country of their dream.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to relent in their search for lasting peace as a necessary condition for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe governor saluted the heroic deeds of patriots, who worked assiduously to actualise democratic rule in the country, especially, the symbol of the June 12 struggle, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, saying only a truly great, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria can be a befitting compensation for their sacrifices\n\n\u201cWe may not have reached the promised land, but we have left Egypt. We may not have attained the best, but we surely have made some progress as a nation,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nABIOLA\u2019S DAUGHTER\n\nHafsat Abiola-Costello, one of the daughters of the presumed winner of the June 12 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola, said her family would not forget the role played by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, in ensuring that their late patriarch was immortalised for his contribution to democracy. Abiola-Costello also praised the minister for his role in the renaming of Kudirat Abiola Road, in memory of her mother, who was brutally murdered during her struggles to regain the stolen mandate of her husband.\n\nShe said long before President Muhammadu Buhari came in as president, Aregbesola, who was then governor of Osun State, had embarked on a one-man campaign to press for recognition of Abiola as winner of the 1993 election and, indeed, to be recognised as a former president.\n\nOGUN\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun said the best way for Nigerians to immortalise and celebrate the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, the late Chief MKO Abiola, and June 12, was to build bridges and demolish sectarian fences. Abiodun stated this on Saturday in his speech at the 2021 Democracy Day celebration, held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nThe governor, who said Nigerians could not afford to bring down the country or despair in its future, noted that the supreme price paid by the Abiola and his mandate should serve as a reminder that Nigerians were stronger together as a nation.\n\n\u201cUntil Nigerians embrace the essence of the MKO persona, internalise belief in self, faith in a united country and other initiatives that help to engender a sense of shared heritage amongst Nigerian people, we will continue to be a country in search of nationhood,\u201d he said.\n\nAbiodun urged Nigerians to push all the negative and divisive forces and policies on the back-foot and embrace the symbolism of June 12, saying, \u201cLet us join hands to make Nigeria work for all Nigerians. June 12 represents what will strengthen the country\u2019s unity, indivisibility and oneness.\u201d He added that such unity would end all quests for self-determination and other sectarian agitations, as well as calm frayed nerves.\n\nBAYELSA\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, expressed his administration\u2019s determination to change the development narrative of the state. Diri spoke on Saturday at Government House, Yenagoa, during his maiden media chat that was broadcast live on all Yenagoa-based radio stations.\n\nThe media interaction was part of activities to commemorate this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nThe governor, in a press statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, said democracy was about the people and Nigeria had come a long way with 22 years of uninterrupted civil rule, which he said had not been smooth but worth celebrating.\n\nHe noted that the urban renewal programme and other projects and policies of his administration were part of the drive to give the state a new look and make it more attractive to investors.\n\nDiri said the state had a lot of tourism potential and the government was open to discussion and ready to sign memorandum of understanding with partners to develop projects in the sector.\n\nOn the federal government\u2019s infrastructure development refund to the state, the governor clarified that the actual amount it received was N27.5 billion and not N38.4 billion, as being speculated in some quarters.\n\nHe explained that though the total refund due the state was N38.4 billion, according to the federal government, its release would not be possible in the next four years. He said the state was offered a second option of a discounted amount of N27.5 billion through the Debt Management Office, which it got last December.\n\nResponding to a question on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent directive to revive cattle grazing routes across the country, Diri said there were no such routes in the state. He explained that although he was not countering the federal government\u2019s decision to resuscitate grazing routes, his administration had put in place a legal framework to ban open grazing and movement of cattle on foot.\n\nThe Bayelsa governor also emphasised that the southern governors had adopted the same position on the issue as part of measures to check farmers/herders clashes across the country.\n\nDiri maintained that his government could not afford to expose its citizenry to the looming danger.\n\nKADUNA CAN\n\nChairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, said June 12 could not be celebrated as Democracy Day because Nigerian leaders were not democratic. Hayab said Nigerians could not be governed by intimidation and still celebrate June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY on Saturday, Hayab said in a true democracy, there was rule of law and freedom of speech.\n\nAccording to him, June 12 is merely a date set aside by the government, though there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating.\n\nHayab stated, \u201cWe are simply celebrating a date set aside by the government but there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating. The spirit behind June 12 is supposed to make our current leaders truly democratic but what we see is governance by intimidation and creating fear in the minds of citizens.\n\n\u201cA true sign of democracy is the freedom citizens enjoy and respect for the rule of law, which is visibly absent in the way we have been governed in this country. I wish the government should have remembered that in a few days or in the second week of June. We will have this day to be reminded to celebrate before announcing the ban on Twitter and many uncomplimentary comments about other regions by the president.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom said he was not against Buhari as a person but often disagreed with him on the constitutionality of issues and policy. Ortom said those who insinuated that his disagreement with the president was bone out of hatred were wrong. He stated that the attack on him would not force his administration to repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in the state.\n\nThe governor declared that anyone who thought the state government would be intimidated to repeal the law was making a great mistake. He said his administration was trying to amend the law to increase the penalties against anyone who flouted it.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Banquet Hall of Government House, Makurdi, while giving his midterm scorecard as part of activities marking this year\u2019s Democracy Day, Ortom said, \u201cI have always prayed and supported the president but when it comes to issues of fairness and illegality, I will disagree.\n\n\u201cThe law on ranching has come to stay and no amount of intimidation can make us to repeal it. Instead, we will soon amend the law in order to increase the penalties against offenders.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who listed his administration\u2019s achievements in the areas of education, agriculture, infrastructure, and health, among others, lamented the humanitarian situation caused by the continued attacks by armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in Benue communities.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe security threat from armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in our communities has resulted in wanton killings and the displacement of people in large numbers across the state.\n\n\u201cToday, Benue State has over one million IDPs with many of them living in the camps we have set up and others staying with their relations. The situation has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the huge sums of money his administration had been spending to cater for the Internally displaced persons, resources were always inadequate because the number of IDPs increased daily.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cMy desire is to ensure that the IDPs return to their ancestral homes. Most of them are farmers, and the longer they stay in the camps, the more food production is affected. We hope that the federal government will also fulfil its promise to assist Benue and other states in the North-central, which have been badly affected by the attacks to resettle the victims.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that many of his colleagues had been coming around to encourage him on his stand to hold the presidency accountable over insecurity in the country but were too afraid to talk.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Directs PDP to use November 2017 delegate lists\n\n\u2022New chairman cancels elected ad hoc delegates\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nWith less than a week to the commencement of the governorship primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has nullified the Southeast Zonal Congresses, which held on March 6, 2021.\n\nConsequently, the High Court has sacked the state chairman of the party, Chief Ndubuisi Nwobu and replaced him with Ejike Oguebego, while directing the PDP PDP to use the November 2017 delegate lists in conducting its governorship primary election.\n\nFollowing the news, however, the court-installed chairman, Mr Chukwudi Umeaba, has announced the cancelation of the recently held ward congresses of the party to elect three-man Adhoc delegates for the forthcoming primary election of the party.\n\nBut a factional chairman of the party in the state, Mr Ndubuisi Nwobu, while reacting to the court judgement that installed Umeaba, dismissed the ruling as being of no moment and having no consequences on the party, urging his members to disregard it.\n\nThe local government congresses that is expected to produce the national delegates that will choose the governorship candidate of the PDP have been scheduled for June 17 2021.\n\nThe plaintiff, Samuel Anyakorah had approached Justice O.A. Adeniyi of the High Court of Justice, Abuja Division, seeking among others, the nullification of the March Congresses (1st defendant, PDP) to the extant list of already inaugurated party officers and delegates that emerged \u201cfrom the Anambra PDP congress conducted on 28 November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017, validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba as acting chairman, State Caretaker Committee.\u201d\n\nIn the suit with reference numbered HC/CV/774/2021, Anyakorah, on behalf of himself and all local government chairmen and ward executives, who emerged from the 28th November 2017 and 1st December 2017, by way of originating summons, sought a declaration that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution of the PDP (amended in 2017), \u201cthe said constitution is supreme,\u201d arguing that it has \u201ca binding force on all members and organs of the PDP and that any action or step taken contrary to the relevant provisions of the constitution is unlawful, illegal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff also argued that it was unlawful for the PDP, \u201cwhether during its Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March 2021, or at any other time, to adopt or publish the name of a state chairman, alongside persons purporting to be EXCO members, local government chairmen and national delegates without recourse to the officers and delegates that emerged in 2017.\n\nHe further sought an order nullifying or setting aside all Congresses, designations or appointment made by the PDP with respect to the state chairman for PDP in Anambra State, EXCO members, local government chairmen and national delegates amongst others.\n\nThis is as the plaintiff further prayed the court for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the PDP, its allies or cronies from further recognising or dealing with persons names on pages 14, 15 and 16 of the Bronchure for the South-East Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, \u201ceither as state Chairman, EXCO members, local government area chairmen or national delegates of PDP, Anambra State chapter.\n\nIn its judgment of June 9, 2021, the court upheld the prayer of the plaintiff, citing Article 2 of the PDP constitution,\n\nAccording to Justice Adeniyi, after listening to the claimant, Anyakora, local government chairmenand ward executives that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on November 28 2017 under the supervision of the chairman state caretaker committee said, \u201cI find merit in the Claimant\u2019s case and the same hereby succeeds. For avoidance of doubts and abundance of clarity, it is hereby adjudged as follows:\n\n\u201cIt is hereby declared that by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party (amended in 2017), the said Constitution is supreme and it has a binding force on all members and organs of the Peoples Democratic Party, and any action or step taken contrary to the relevant provisions of the Constitution is unlawful, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby further declared that it is unlawful for the 1 Defendant, (PDP) whether during its Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, or at any time to adopt or publish the name of a State Chairman, alongside persons purporting to be his Exco members, Local Government Chairmen and National Delegates, without recourse to the extant List of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegated that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1 December, 2017 validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel or and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Covernment Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as Acting Chairman, State Caretaker Committee.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby further declared that the arbitrary imposition by the 1st Defendant on its members of a State Chairman, Exco members, Local Government Chairmen and National Delegates, as contained atPages 14. 15 & 16 of the Defendant\u2019s Brochure for the Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March, 2021, in ultra vires its power, unlawful, invalid, void and of no effcet whatsoever\u201d, Justice Adebiyi declared.\n\nIn view of this, Justice Adebiyi further ordered that, \u201cAll Congresses, designations or appointments made by the 1st Defendant with respect to the positions of the State Chairman of PDP Anambra State Chapter, Exco Members and Local Government Chairmen, as contained at Pages 14, 15 & 16 of the Southeast Zonal Congress Brochure of 6th March, 2021, are hereby nullified and set aside for being invalid, unlawful and ultra vires the powers of the 1st Defendant, the same not being in alignment with the List of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017, valided by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as State Caretaker Committee. Acting Chairman.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Justice Adebiyi said the \u201cfirst defendant is hereby ordered and compelled that during the conduct of all elections in Anambra State, to henceforth adopt, employ, recognise and use only the list of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017 validated by the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, who shall continue to act in the capacities for which they were duly elected.\n\n\u201cAn Order of injunction is hereby issued, restraining the 1st Defendant, whether by itself, cronies, allies or representatives, from further recognising, dealing with or parading any person or group of persons listed at pages 14, 15 & 16 of the Brochure for the Southeast Zonal Congress of 6th March 2021, either as State Chairman, Exco members or Local Government Area Chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party, Anambra State Chapter, except the list of already inaugurated Party Officers and Delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP Congresses conducted on 28th November, 2017 and 1st December, 2017 the Senator Grace Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel Report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel Report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba.\u201d\n\nHe contended that all parties shall bear their respective costs of the action.\n\nThe implication of this is that unless the party succeeds at the appellate court, if it chooses to challenge the ruling of the lower court, it may find itself fielding parallel delegates in the November 6 election, which may call for the replication of the Zamfara scenario, which cost the All Progressives Congress, the North Western state in 2019.\n\nHow the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) handles this slippery judicial rulingwill determine the fate of the party in Anambra, a state it governed for some years before losing out to the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nHowever, Umeaba, at a press conference yesterday told journalists that: \u201cBased on the above (his reinstatement), I, Hon Chukwudi Umeaba, the acting chairman caretaker committee of PDP, Anambra State, working in concert with the terms of reference and the powers of my office will make pronouncements.\n\n\u201cI hereby suspend the ward congress of 9th June to elect a three-man Adhoc committee for the governorship primary. I will contact the NEC of our great party to give me a new date for the ward congresses that will elect the three-man ad hoc committee for the governorship primary.\u201d\n\nHe urged the party members to keep calm and look forward to new developments as his leadership was out to ensure growth of the party in the state. He insisted that the primary election would go on as planned, and would not be truncated by the change in leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of a new chairman of the party in the state has polarised the party, leaving many of its members switching camp to the faction of the new leadership.\n\nA chieftain of the party, Mr Samuel Anyakorah, who was at the press conference described the Umeaba-led party as the authentic leadership of the party, having been unjustly removed in 2017.\n\n\u201cI was the one who dragged the party to court, because of that unjust act. We wrote to the then national vice chairman of South east, Mr Austin Umahi and even to His Excellency, Uche Secondus, but they ignored us.\n\n\u201cThat was why we went to court, and thank God today, the authentic leadership of the party has been restored. You can see how happy everybody is. We hope that the party will move on now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said the Nigerian government cannot afford the amount of funding needed to revive the country\u2019s educational system. Buhari also said the competition for funds had become keener because of the recent increase in the number of tertiary institutions in Nigeria.\n\nThe president spoke on Saturday at the 49th convocation ceremony of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He said the financial situation had been worsened by the global economic downturn, which also affected the national revenue.\n\nBuhari, who was represented at the ceremony by the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, however, said his administration was committed to addressing the needs of tertiary institutions through budgetary allocations to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND).\n\n\u201cI am optimistic that the on-going drive to diversify the national economy will provide the government with additional resources to improve funding for the education system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said the universities should also leverage other funding sources, such as from alumni, friends, the private sector, institutional linkages, and research grants, to attract additional revenue for infrastructure, research, and development.\n\n\u201cWe must also address the problems of poor work ethics and the albatross of prolonged and recurrent industrial actions by staff of universities,\u201d the president stated.\n\nBuhari advised academic institutions across the country to embark on the kind of innovative research that could help boost production and diversify the economy.\n\n\u201cOur universities must continue to emphasise training in entrepreneurship so school leavers and graduates are able to become job creators instead of perennial job seekers,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, said the government should make effort to address the perennial challenge of poverty and inequality in the country or risk losing the youth to crime. Amaechi, who delivered the 49th convocation lecture of the university, stated that the series of protests held across the country of late, such as #ENDSARS, were as a result of increasing poverty and disaffection on the part of the citizens.\n\n\u201cAlthough, the current administration has introduced a number of programmes to help eradicate poverty, such as Transport Track for individuals who were into the transportation business, several Nigerians are yet to be lifted out of poverty,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe stated that policies should be focused on the rural majority, and targeted at giving the citizens a good life and lifting them out of poverty.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "title": "From ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?",
          "text": "Elections are perhaps the core of democracy, a process where people have a say in who leads and how they are led. It\u2019s the point where citizens exercise their power.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, rather than exercise their power during the democratic process, Nigerians have to exhibit courage and bravery. The annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993, is widely regarded as a constant reminder of how democratic power was, and perhaps still is, stripped from the people.\n\nFor Jerry Ojumah, a blockchain developer and designer, election season in Nigeria is a time of anxiety; the focus is on surviving the process and not on the election outcome.\n\n\u201cHow can performing your civic right be an endangerment to your life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a recurring question as Ojumah narrated how he lost his friend, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 general election claimed 626 lives, according to a Premium Times report.\n\nGiven the violence and conflict that characterise Nigerian elections, questioning election results isn\u2019t out of place. Unfortunately, election violence isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by the Law Library of Congress Global Research Center, the 2007 elections observed by the National Democratic Institute reported an obscene amount of irregularities such as underage voting, ballots without names of some candidates, errors in voter registration, and inadequate polling stations.\n\nThe report also highlighted the observations of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which found out that the election did not meet basic regional and international standards.\n\nIt cited lack of organisation, absence of basic transparency, \u201cwidespread procedural irregularities and significant evidence of fraud.\u201d\n\nTo bring transparency and safety back to elections, perhaps a technological intervention, a process that is immutable and free of external influence, should be considered.\n\nBlockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin. But in truth, cryptocurrencies are only an application of blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain is to Bitcoin what the Internet is to email. It is just the technology upon which cryptocurrencies work.\n\nAlso known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain has been considered an answer to election problems.\n\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016. He says with blockchain, hackers will need to do the impossible \u2014 hack through a network of computers.\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger\n\nBlockchain has been used for elections in some countries, but the technology is very far from mainstream adoption.\n\nPer tech publication Hacker Noon, blockchain was used for voting in Sierra Leone, Japan, and Russia.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the exercise was controversial as it turns out the blockchain company contracted for the job might not have used blockchain at all.\n\nThe tech was also introduced in Tsukuba City, Japan. However, it has only been used to vote for social development proposals.\n\nIt was in the US, however, that the use of blockchain began to look like a real replacement for the current system of elections.\n\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system. The news says it was a success as over 140 people voted.\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology. This raises the question of how people who are not familiar with the technology will use it during the elections.\n\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah. It was made for the Covenant University Alumni Association (CUALA) election.\n\nAccording to Ojumah, the platform will be easier to access than traditional voting methods, with people voting from the comfort of their homes.\n\nVoters can access the platform with a computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. All they have to do is click on their preferred candidate, and the information goes into the blockchain network.\n\nInterestingly, Ojumah adds that blockchain-powered voting will reduce the cost of running elections tremendously. The Guardian reports that \u20a6245 billion was budgeted for elections in 2019.\n\nA large portion of the budget went to logistics and security. Ojumah believes that without the need for logistics and security costs, less than a fraction of that budget would be required to conduct a blockchain-powered election.\n\nNevertheless, usability and scalability remain crucial considerations. Ojumah\u2019s response to this is; a simple user interface, available in most Nigerian languages combined with text to speech features for those who cannot read or are visually impaired.\n\n\u201cThanks to new generation blockchain networks, the platform will be able to process large amounts of data simultaneously,\u201d Ojumah says.\n\nIn cases of poor Internet coverage or lack of smartphones, Ojumah submits that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) can be integrated.\n\nCan it work in Nigeria\u2019s political space?\n\nSegun Amure, a one-time aspirant for councilorship in one of the local governments in Osun State, believes that the government should consider anything that will keep elections free and fair.\n\n\u201cIf blockchain technology can guarantee ease of voting in elections, the safety and will of the people I think is good,\u201d Amure says.\n\nOrowale Triumph, a young politician with dreams of one day becoming president, says, \u201cIt sounds like a process that is not faulted by humans; the creator of the platform or the government cannot influence the data. I think the credibility and transparency of the technology can be vouched for, so why not?\u201d\n\nThough Triumph is sure that blockchain will change Nigeria\u2019s current political climate, he doesn\u2019t think Nigerian politicians will adopt such technology.\n\n\u201cThe entire system needs a change\u2026most politicians will stop at nothing to make sure elections go their way. In such a political situation, they will not succumb to a technology that assures free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nClamouring for electoral reform, Triumph says, \u201cThe power again lies with the masses. If they push for the electoral reform act, then there is a possibility that such a technology will be adopted to foster free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nArguments against blockchain elections\n\nA report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published November 2020, sees blockchain elections as a threat to democracy.\n\nClaiming that online voting would increase cybersecurity concerns, the MIT says \u201cVoatz\u201d \u2014 the platform used for elections in the 2018 West Virginia in the US \u2014 suffers from security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.\n\nThe report also cites crypto investors\u2019 losses over the years as a reason to distrust blockchain.\n\nAccording to the report, voter verifiability and contestability are some problems blockchain cannot solve. It, therefore, called for a return to the paper balloting system as it is safer than online voting.\n\nConsidering that money can be stolen online and physically, MIT\u2019s report somewhat strangely predicts that the vulnerabilities associated with online shopping and banking will affect voting with blockchain.\n\nCould these positions and submissions result from a misunderstanding of how a blockchain-powered election works?\n\nHow a blockchain powered-election works\n\nAdedayo Adebajo is the Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the African arm of Jelurida, the Swiss company behind the creation of Ardor, a blockchain network with smart contracts capability.\n\nAccording to Adebajo, creating a poll on the Ardor network requires all voters to have a funded Ardor account. This new generation of blockchain gives the option of KYC for users. So, various conditions can be set before a person is allowed to vote. However, voting is not free.\n\n\u201cEvery single vote is a transaction,\u201d he says.\n\nA transaction needs to be made to vote, and a voter needs at least one Ignis \u2014 a child chain of Ardor and a cryptocurrency \u2014 to vote.\n\nAlternatively, the creator of the polls could pay for everyone\u2019s vote. This means that if the federal government creates polls on the Ignis network, they could pay for everyone to vote.\n\nResponding to whether Jelurida will make money if Nigeria holds elections on its platform, Adebajo says, \u201cWe can not really say they make profit from this because it is still made free and the amount paid is merely for usability purposes.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing this piece, one Ignis was approximately 30 cents. Voting for a population of say 150 million people will cost approximately $45 million, which translates to \u20a621.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the \u20a6245 billion budgeted for the 2019 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the safety of this data, he reveals that in a scenario where 51% of the nodes running Ardor suffer an attack, data could be compromised.\n\nHowever, there are 2,000 Ardor nodes spread across different parts of the world, making the possibility of an attack very slim.\n\nAs a Nigerian, Adebajo feels Nigeria should adopt blockchain voting but he believes it will not happen anytime soon because \u201cthere are a lot of people who benefit from the lack of transparency and lack of digital trails\u201d in elections.\n\nAdebajo suggests that a way to adopt this system of voting is to start small. From voting within associations to voting in local government elections before getting to the national level.\n\nFor Nigerians, adopting a technological solution to solve election problems transcends a desire for ease and convenience during voting. It is perhaps the only alternative to reviving a dying democracy.\n\nNews reports give statistics of lives lost during elections in Nigeria; the pain, however, is inestimable.",

          "title": "Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology",
          "text": "In Africa, mental health resources are scarce, reflecting the weakness of mental health services on the continent. Also, it mirrors how governments and citizens turn a blind eye to the problem.\n\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why Ted Malanda, a Kenyan humour writer, couldn\u2019t comprehend why American actor Robin Williams \u2014 who suffered from depression \u2014 committed suicide in 2014.\n\nWriting via The Standard, Malanda describes how depression \u2014 a mental health disorder \u2014 is such a non-issue on the continent that African languages do not have a word for it.\n\nImpact of mental health disorders\n\nPhoto by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\nA study shows that 13% of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is primarily due to mental health disorders. Almost three-quarters of this burden lies in low and middle-income countries due to extremely scarce health resources and investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMental health is an integral aspect of wellness because it reflects in daily living, relationships, physical health, work, and school productivity.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that mental health disorders, otherwise known as mental health illnesses, vary and come with different presentations.\n\nThese disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders.\n\nThey are characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours, and relationships with others. Therefore, mental wellness should receive as much care as physical health.\n\nGlobally, the impact of mental health illnesses on the economy is significant. The cost of productivity lost annually is approximately $1.15 trillion, while almost 4.7 billion days of productivity are lost.\n\nMayo Clinic \u2014 a US-based non-profit hospital \u2014 mentions that people will always have mental health concerns from time to time. Nonetheless, a mental health concern becomes a mental health disorder when signs and symptoms cause recurring stress and affect the ability to function.\n\nHence, protecting your mental health is essential.\n\nProtecting your mental health with technology\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nThere are effective strategies to prevent and alleviate the suffering caused by mental health disorders, and technology is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of social media can be a cause of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, technology can be advantageous to someone with mental health disorders.\n\nIt has opened a new frontier of mental health support and data collection. Research shows that mobile phones and Internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to collect objective information on individuals\u2019 behaviour.\n\nThis information helps generate a data set that provides insight into an individual\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nThe University of Illinois, Chicago, encourages Internet-based support groups, telehealth, and mobile apps to protect one\u2019s mental health.\n\nMobile mental health support can be simple and effective. Globally, about 800 mobile apps help users cope with symptoms, share their stories, and meet with psychiatrists and psychotherapists.\n\nFurthermore, they provide valuable data to physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts.\n\nInternet-based support groups help people with mental health disorders, guiding them while they reveal their struggles anonymously. And telehealth provides consultation with a health care provider via phone or video conference.\n\nHow technology is protecting mental health in Africa\n\nA study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) shows that doctors, researchers, and the public can access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing with mobile devices like phones and tablets. In Africa, some startups and non-profit organisations already do this.\n\nWe examine two startups and one user-led community helping people with mental health disorders in Africa.\n\nShezlong\n\nFounded in 2015 by Ahmed Abu ElHaz, an Egyptian software engineer, Shezlong is a healthtech startup that offers people in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region on-demand mental health care.\n\nIt is the first online psychotherapy clinic in the region.\n\nShezlong has a mobile app that aims to help people with mental health disorders become more confident and make better life decisions. They also offer relationship counselling.\n\nShezlong homepage\n\nThe app is used in more than 60 countries. Over 300 certified and trusted therapists and psychiatrists are conveniently, privately, and anonymously connected with people with mental disorders in MENA.\n\nTruthshare\n\nTruthshare is an online mental health application that helps people get counselling. It was co-founded in 2019 by two Nigerians: Kuro Briggs and Fortune Bekee.\n\nTruthshare homepage\n\nThe online app aims to improve the mental health of Nigerians. It leverages the Internet to provide a safe place where people can express themselves anonymously, get access to certified counsellors, and feel better.\n\nMoreover, the public can offer advice to people struggling with their mental health.\n\nMentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)\n\nMANI is a user-led community that uses social media platforms to reach its audience.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Victor Ugo, MANI is based on two core beliefs: to alleviate the stigma and suffering which arises from mental disorders and to know that people who have mental health disorders have a right to life and assistance.\n\nMANI attempts to fight stigma, improve mental health literacy, and drive policies that benefit mental health service users and those at risk.\n\nIt also engages in activities and services that promote and prevent mental health issues.\n\nWhen asked how MANI has helped people with mental health disorders, Max, a writer, told Techpoint Africa, \u201cWhen I was depressed last year, Mentally Aware Nigeria helped me get better. They assigned someone \u2014 who should be a counsellor \u2014 to me. They followed me up on WhatsApp until I started feeling better. That worked for me.\u201d\n\nTechnology has made mental health care affordable and convenient. And anyone with a mental illness can get care anywhere. The use of mobile apps and online platforms offer users the option of anonymity, helping them avoid stigmatisation as they share their stories.\n\nIn recognition of Global Wellness Day, we want you to take care of your mental health as much as you do your physical health. If social media is a source of depression or anxiety for you, you could take a break and take advantage of the Internet.\n\nWe care about your mental health and hope you get the help you need.\n\nHappy Global Wellness Day.",

          "title": "Six years of APC in the saddle: Whither the rosy promises?",
          "text": "Before the 2015 general election, it was Muhammadu Buhari all the way. In fact, at a point, the name became a household name, especially for die-hard supporters, who threw their all into making sure Buhari won the election.\n\nAfter his failed attempts at winning the 2003, 2007 and 2011 presidential polls, three biggest opposition parties \u2013 the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) came together and formed the All Progressives Congress (APC) in February 2013.\n\nDesperate to win the 2015 presidential elections, the party made all manner of promises, including ban on government officials from going abroad for medical treatment; generation, transmission and distribution of at least 20,000 megawatt of electricity within four years; making naira stable at the international market; amending the Nigerian Constitution to ensure devolution of powers, duties, and responsibilities to states in order to entrench true federalism; ending gas flaring and ensuring sales of at least half of gas produced within the country, among others.\n\nRegrettably, six years down the line, Buhari and his party have failed to even deliver on the three cardinal points of reviving the economy, improving security and fighting corruption, which were the main thrust of their campaign.\n\nBut the presidency has reeled out Buhari\u2019s achievements in different sectors in celebration of his sixth anniversary: They are: infrastructure, power, housing, agriculture, education, health, asset recovery, security and justice reform, diplomacy and international relations.\n\nIn agriculture, for instance, the presidency noted that the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than N300 billion to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soya Beans, Groundnut, Fish). When you put this in context, it means empowering 3.1 million smallholder farmers would invariably improve food production, but the reverse has been the case as food inflation keeps hitting the roof. In the last two years, more farmers have been killed more than any other time in the history of the country.\n\nTo say the least, President Buhari\u2019s six years in office has been hell on earth. It is nothing to write home about as woes, anguish and insecurity has become the order of the day.\n\nObviously, Buhari\u2019s government has clearly demonstrated that it lacks the capacity to bring governance closer to the people. The economy is not shaping up. Key economic indicators show that inflation rate has moved 9.00percent in 2015 to 18.12percent in 2021; unemployment rate from 8.19percent in 2015 to 33.28percent in 2021; debt profile from N12.60trn in 2015 to N32.92trn in 2021; exchange rate from $1/N197 in 2015 to $1/N410 in 2021; foreign reserves from $28.57bn in 2015 to $34.27bn in 2021 and GDP growth rate 2.79percent in 2015 to 0.5percent in (Q1 2021).\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate has been described as a \u2018time bomb\u2019 waiting to explode. But the stark reality is that the time bomb has since exploded before our very face in the form of terrorism, banditry, armed robbery, cultism, kidnapping, rapists and ritualists.\n\nEvery part of the country is facing one form of security threat or the other. For instance, in the North-East, it is terrorism, North-West is banditry, while in the North-Central, it has been Fulani herdsmen killing hapless farmers, especially in Benue State.\n\nIn the southern part of the country, South-East precisely, it is attack on police stations, INEC offices and correctional centres, in the South-South; it is more of kidnapping and cult clashes. In the South-West, it is communal clashes.\n\nThe recent attack in Igangan, a community in Ibarapa North Local Government of Oyo State, where over 20 people were killed, was one of such clashes.\n\nAs a retired general, many Nigerians had thought that with Buhari at the helms of affairs, the security challenges undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence would have effectively been nipped in the bud. Alas! Six years after, Nigerians are asking: how did we get to this state of hopelessness? Unfortunately, this ugly situation has largely scared away foreign investors.\n\nCorruption under this government is mind-boggling. A president, who is serious about fighting corruption, championing transparency and accountability in governance, should have sent a strong message to some officials of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) accused of looting and financial rascality.\n\nUnder this administration, the country\u2019s external and domestic debts have continued to rise with no commensurate improvements in the quality of life of the people. According to the Debt Management Office, external debt has risen exponentially to hit $33.34bn by December 2021 compared to $10.31bn in June 2015.\n\nNo doubt, Buhari\u2019s six years in office is something Nigerians will not forget in a hurry because of the untold hardship many have been subjected to. They argued that the remaining two years look bleak and uncertain.\n\nThe question many now ask is: can he redeem his image with the two years left in his tenure? Can he listen to voices of reason and truly be a president for all Nigerians? Can he assert himself as the president and Commander-in-Chief and stop playing aloofness in matters of national importance?\n\nAs it stands, what Buhari will be best remembered for are hunger and destruction of life and property. The hue and cry in the land is quite alarming. This is certainly not a legacy any sane man would want to be remembered for.\n\nTherefore, the president should, as a matter of urgency, use his remaining two years to redeem himself by rising to the occasion when the need arises, listen to voice of reasons and be prompt and decisive in dealing with criminal elements bent on destroying the country. He should look into the wanton killings, especially those ones being committed by his fellow Fulani people. At this challenging time, he should be in the fore front of uniting the country. In fact, now is the time for him to sit up and call the shots.\n\nBuhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) made lots of promises to Nigerians, including restructuring of the country to give every section of the country a sense of belonging. The Nasir el-Rufai Committee has since 2018 submitted its report. He should go ahead and implement the report. Not doing so will not only bring him in a bad light, but also as a man who lacks integrity and courage.\n\nAs the ninth National Assembly gears towards passing the Electoral Act Amendment bill before going on its long recess in July, Buhari owes Nigerians a duty to sign that bill into law.

Dep Gov\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu on Saturday in Benin, called on Nigerians to work together in sustenance of democratic ideals so as to provide room for equity, freedom of speech and sustainable development.\n\nShaibu stated this while addressing a cross section of protesters who were in a peaceful protest to Edo Government House, Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have distinguished between the military and civil rule. We have agreed that the difference is freedom of speech. Democracy is here to stay. We have fought for the sustenance of democracy.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of the 14 lawmakers-elect who abdicated their roles, he said, \u201cI also want to address the issue of the 14 Edo State House of Assembly members-elect who failed to make themselves available for swearing-in after Governor Godwin Obaseki issued a proclamation letter.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I don\u2019t have a representative from Etsako West Constituency II because these characters decided to follow a godfather shortly after they were voted into office. Today, godfathers have taken over our democracy.\n\n\u201cThey have taken over democracy that you and I struggled for. The democracy that the likes of Ransome Kuti and Gani Fawehinmi fought for. All of them struggled to have democracy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the development has destroyed the fabric of our society, adding, \u201cIn Edo, these characters decided to follow a godfather. One of our Comrades, Adams Oshiomhole, led us in the struggle in Edo to say no to godfatherism.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, he removed his khaki and now wears the armor of a godfather. This led to the kind of House of Assembly we now have in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe did everything to beg them; we said you are not representing one godfather you are representing the good people of your constituency. But they refused to come back and be sworn-in. Somebody far away in Lagos, instead was giving them instructions. He said that the governor should issue a second proclamation letter which is against the law. How can somebody from Lagos be dictating for us in Edo? We said no to that, and insisted that Edo people must decide for themselves.\n\nShaibu said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been unable to conduct a bye-election, because the matter was still in the court.\n\nThe deputy governor also advocated for a unicameral legislature to reduce the cost of governance, adding that the funds saved from the restructured legislative system would be used for the development of states.\n\nHe further advocated for state policing, noting that the policing arrangement should be given consideration in the ongoing constitution amendment process so as to check insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nOne of the protesters, Abraham Oviawe, said the quest was for all Nigerians to enjoy the dividends of democracy, noting that the present administration has stifled free speech.\n\nHe urged the government to ensure adequate security of lives and property, saying that the Federal Government is paying lip service to the issue of security.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of democracy, Nigerians are still suffering as the standard of living has gone from bad to worse in the country. We enjoy freedom of speech but not freedom after speech. Democracy is a reminder to the people the quality of service before them,\u201d he said.\n\n...",

It was in the process of stabilising his health that he gave up the ghost,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhile commiserating with the family of the deceased and the entire members of the university community, the Management, however, warned against any plan by students or group of persons to engage in any act that could jeopardise the peace being enjoyed on campus in whatever form.\n\nThe statement said the university will not condone any act capable of disrupting the peace on campuses, adding that any student caught doing so would be decisively dealt with.\n\nBUK asks ministry of works to erect pedestrian bridge\n\nThe university management said it has requested the Federal Ministry of Works to construct a pedestrian bridge near the main gate of the new campus.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, it should also be noted that in its determined effort to ensure the safety of students and other stakeholders of the University, the Management had, early this year (2021) made a submission to the Federal Ministry of Works on the urgent need to construct a pedestrian bridge near the main gate of the New Campus for use by students in crossing over the trunk \u2018A\u2019 highway that passes by the side of the university.\n\n\u201cAlready, the Ministry had obliged to the request of constructing the bridge and arrangement has gone far in that regard,\u201d the statement said.",

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption failure fuelling insecurity, undermining democracy \u2013 Report",
          "text": "A think tank, Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), has slammed Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari for not doing enough to combat the endemic corruption in the public service, despite promising to do so during his campaign.\n\nThe group said though Buhari often repeated promise to fight corruption with zero tolerance, the promise has remained \u201clargely unmet\u201d, and the failure fuels Nigeria\u2019s worsening insecurity and undermines democratic promises.\n\n\u201cAs the candidate who rode into office in 2015 on a wave of popular anger with entrenched elite corruption, he has made little effort to reform Nigeria\u2019s patronage-fueled, scandal-prone public sector or hold his top officials accountable for their business-as-usual approach,\u201d CDD said in its report, titled, \u201cBuhari\u2019s Anti-Corruption Record at Six Years: An Assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the 2023 election season already ramping up, and Buhari\u2019s hands-off governing style largely unchanged, his government\u2019s anti-corruption track record is set to go down in history as one characterised by missed opportunities and, in some respects, outright hypocrisy. His 2016 promise to \u201cdemonstrate zero tolerance for corrupt practices\u201d remains largely unmet.\u201d\n\nCDD said, according Premium Times, however, its criticism does not mean the Buhari administration has done nothing in the area of anti-corruption. It then gave an outline, including improved financial centralisation, referring to TSA and IPPIS; and higher conviction rates by anti-corruption agencies. The civic group also praised the president for appointing as a substantive EFCC chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, whom it described as \u201ca dynamic and experienced investigator\u201d.\n\nNotwithstanding, CDD said it noted \u201cseveral significant shortcomings,\u201d including the president\u2019s \u201cwillingness to appoint individuals of questionable integrity to key positions; his tendency to shield political allies from investigation and prosecution; his disinterest in how the ruling party funds its election campaigns; his failure to make key petroleum sector reforms; and his corruption-prone economic and fiscal policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of these challenges remain largely unaddressed,\u201d CDD said.\n\n\u201cTwo Pandemics: COVID-19 and Corruption\u201d\n\nIn the name of controlling the spread of COVID-19 and cushioning the effects of the restrictions, CDD said the Buhari administration \u201copaquely\u201d awarded contracts worth N450 million or $1 million to \u201cbriefcase firms\u201d not registered with the Bureau of Public Procurement. It said the emergency spending was disbursed to politically-connected contractors and channeled through existing corrupt structures.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, some government agencies used the pandemic as a pretext to spend lavishly on themselves The Niger Delta Development Commission, for example, disbursed 1.5 billion ($4.2 million) in large cash payments to its own staff members in the name of COVID relief. When questioned by legislators, the Commission\u2019s managing director tried to justify the payments, saying: \u201cwe used it to take care of ourselves\u2026we need to take care of ourselves\u201d,\u201d the think tank said.\n\nCorruption and insecurity\n\nSince Mr Buhari came to power in 2015, insecurity has intensified and spread, affecting virtually all parts of the country. In the north, apart from the Boko Haram in the North-east, armed bandits and terrorists alike are crumbling communities and mass-abducting students at schools in the North-west and North-central zones.\n\nIn the South, herders\u2019 violence has intensified and armed militias of the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra are operating, with attacks on INEC and security facilities and personnel and innocent citizens. The separatists were initially unarmed and Nigerian forces under Mr Buhari extra-judicially killed scores of them between 2015 and 2016, a PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 Global Shinning Light Award investigation found.\n\n\u201cHollowed out by strategic- and operational-level corruption, Nigeria\u2019s military and police appear incapable of safeguarding many parts of the country,\u201d CDD said, drawing a link between the problem of corruption and insecurity, \u201cThe normalisation of security sector corruption means that military and police leaders failures\u2019 offer them new opportunities to racketeer and profiteer, as well as embezzle from increased emergency security spending.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cFor Nigeria\u2019s top brass, peace is much less lucrative than perpetual low-intensity conflict. Yet President Buhari has done little to change their calculus, hold them accountable or exert strong oversight over their activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder President Buhari, security sector corruption has become both a cause and a consequence of rising insecurity across the country. Defence procurement remains as opaque and graft-prone as it did under his predecessor and largely exempt from due process rules designed to prevent corruption.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Backsliding Fuels Corruption\n\nUnder Mr Buhari, the civic space has continued to shrink, CDD said, mentioning violent crackdown on protests and moves to \u201cimpose tighter regulations on legitimate civil society groups while at the same time bankrolling hundreds of fake\u201d NGOs.\n\n\u201c90% of Nigeria\u2019s 360-plus progovernment NGOs have started operating since President Buhari took office, a correlation that suggests many enjoy high-level political support,\u201d CDD claimed.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, ruling party legislators have, in recent years, introduced two bills aimed at regulating NGOs through the creation of a new government agency. If they succeed, the Buhari government may be inclined to use such an agency to target civil society voices that criticise its governance, human rights and corruption record.\u201d\n\nThe think tank expressed pessimism that the president would have the time or political capital to push through sustainable anti-corruption reforms, and called on other stakeholders to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cIntegrity-conscious National Assembly members could, for example, introduce legislation outlawing security votes at the federal, state and local levels. Such a ban should be accompanied by transparent and comprehensive budgeting procedures and criteria for security expenditures that meet international best practices and incorporate robust oversight mechanisms,\u201d CDD recommended.\n\nIt also called on Nigeria\u2019s international partners to prioritise anti-corruption in their engagements and assistance toward the African nation.",

          "title": "AESID Condemns Renewed Izzi/Ikwo Communal Hostility In Ebonyi",
          "text": "The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has condemned the renewed communal clashes between the people of Enyibichiri, Izzi in Abakaliki local government area and Echialike, Ikwo, Ikwo local government area of Ebonyi State over a protracted land dispute, demanding an end to the hostility.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ebonyi indigenes also condemned in totality, the abduction of some Izzi children by fighters alleged to be from the Echi-Alike area.\n\nIn a statement released to journalists on Sunday in Abuja by AESID president worldwide, Amb. Paschal Oluchukwu, he expressed concerns over the attacks on lives and property by natives of the two communities, who he said have remained peaceful and peace-loving brothers of the same Ekumenyi progenitor.\n\n\u201cThough we had condemned this renewed hostilities, we find this latest news of abduction of under-aged children most perturbing. As parents, we cannot imagine how traumatized their wards and parents must have been since the ugly news of their abduction broke.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge therefore that the anger over the latest development on the crisis must have necessitated the reported attacks on Ikwo natives even in the Abakaliki capital city and the heightening apprehension over reprisal attacks that have since pervaded the two popular clans.\n\n\u201cAs at the last count, we scooped that some prominent Ikwo natives have deserted the capital city to some other parts of the region and the country while those who may not afford the luxury of travelling that far have relocated to their Ikwo communities.\n\n\u201cAESID is worried and tempted to again, demand that the world must blame Umahi\u2019s reprehensible laxity for not nipping this ugly incident in the bud not only as the Chief Security Officer of the State but also as one who is known for playing politics with every damn affair or issue in the state.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, hope and challenge the governor who has always threatened to incite wars against brothers as part of his political strategies to deal with his opponents and those he consider enemies, to come out boldly and deny the fingers pointing at him that it is possible he may have deployed his usual style of cutting the trees in the bush and at the same time rushing out of the road to ask; who is behind the wood-cutting in the bush?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe feel that if this is not what we think it is: dealing with the opposition by other means, why has the Governor been reportedly threatening some PDP Lawmakers and other stakeholders of the party arrested to either declare for the APC or remain in detention? Some of them like the House of Assembly Majority leader, Engr. Humphrey Nwuruku who had been held in detention over the crises for several days, we authoritatively learnt have evidence of a chat message from the governor and his allies giving his defection to the APC as a condition for his release from detention,\u201d Oluchukwu said.\n\nWhile wondering how a once-peaceful state has become a spectacle of communal wars since Umahi came to power in 2015, the group said the situation was getting worse since January 22, 2021 when the Effium killings started.\n\n\u201cFrom attacks between indigenous Effium natives Versus Ezza-Effium in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi North to Iyionu in Ishielu in Ebonyi Central and Ikwo Versus Izzi in the same Central Senatorial zone to Ishinkwo Ukawu versus Abaomege (who are still Ekumenyi brothers) in Ebonyi South, is it not reasonable to suspect that these could all be part of the desperate antics of Governor Umahi to make sure that the Umuekumenyi brothers does not have a common voice when they go into elections in 2023?\n\n\u201cAlready, some political pundits have also wondered why it is Ikwo which has the largest political wards in the State with as much as 20 political wards of any LGA in the State and the Izzi that is one of the clans with largest number of voters that would suddenly be up in arms against one another. When will Umahi return our beloved state to the peaceful path he met it and end these persistent bloodsheds?\n\n\u201cWe conclude by demanding the immediate release of the reportedly abducted kids and asking leaders of thoughts from Umuekumenyi to convoke an extraordinary, apolitical stakeholders meeting which shall involve all youths and key stakeholders to address these challenges and embrace peaceful co-existence among one another. We feel they would be the greatest losers to go into any form of war with each other when it is even now that they need each other most.\n\n\u201cThey should therefore prove their enemies and traducers wrong by not only amicably resolving this dispute but ensure that going forward, they would be no love lost between and among brothers of the same Ekumenyi progenitor. This, AESID believes is the best way to go for any meaningful development to be initiated and sustained in their local communities,\u201d he added.\n\nhttps://leadership.ng/covid-19-probe-ebonyi-palliative-sharing-aesid-urges-efcc-icpc-others/",

          "title": "OPINION: 60 Gun-salute To The Literary General",
          "text": "Back in the 90s, we used to time each of his literary parturitions, the way a sprinter\u2019s dash on the track to the finish-line is scored. The digital age hadn\u2019t yet fully dawned in newsrooms in this corner of the earth then. So, it was still largely an intense communion between the pen and \u201coffcuts\u201d (writing sheets improvised from stumps of newsprint reel).\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom crafting often uniquely creative intro to the final word, it never used to take Sam Omatseye more than a fleeting moment to consummate, say, a great column or pithy analysis for Concord titles.\n\n\u201cSo, timekeeper,\u201d he would inquire convivially, facing me in the small office that sheltered Concord\u2019s Politics Desk as the lady typist took the last page, \u201cDid I miss?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn target!,\u201d I would exclaim, laughing with adulating thumb-up.\n\nOf course, the stop-watch never exceeded thirty or forty minutes for Sam to churn out a masterpiece of between 1,000 and 1,200 words. A feat around which his fame had partly been built within the Concord family. The other half being the vigour of his thought and the charm of his language \u2014 lyrical, even laconic. His prodigious knowledge is undoubtedly reflected in his uncannily relentless facility to lead and buffet readers with ideas and quotations from great thinkers in history.\n\nIn inter-personal conversations, no less commanding is Sam\u2019s ability to recite copious portions of the Holy Bible with the seamless ease of a computer that would fill even a seasoned Pentecostal pastor with envy. A skill matched equally by an adroitness at recalling, off-hand, long passages from literary classics. And then his bonhomie accentuated by deep-set eyes and an easy throaty laughter that unfurls remarkably immaculate full dentition.\n\nLooking back, what a great fraternity we built at Concord, bonded by a spirit that turned office to family. Led by Mr. Tunji Bello (presently Lagos Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources), the clan included Victor Ifijeh, Kayode Komolafe, Segun Adeniyi, Waheed Odusile, Yomi Idowu, Jonas Agwu, Abdulwarees Solanke, Gboyega Amonboye, Goke Odeyinka, Jill Agbiliazau-Okeke among others. (More elaboration on this in a forthcoming 300-page book devoted to Tunji Bello\u2019s Diamond Jubilee.)\n\nA bard of crisp imagery, withering wit and sometimes subversive metaphor, Sam would, for instance, characterize Segun Adeniyi and I as \u201cpassion versus prose\u201d in his reading of the distinction between our respective creative temperaments.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlmost three decades later, it is gratifying to note that Sam\u2019s energy has not waned. In fact, it will be no exaggeration to say his muse has since ramified into a Trojan of sorts, straddling Nigeria\u2019s literary space. As he turns 60 on June 15, there can, therefore, be no better time to pause and salute this sterling ambassador of the letters.\n\nIndeed, in Nigeria\u2019s contemporary artistic firmament, very few literary avians could be said to soar close, let alone higher than Sam. In the simultaneous expression of multiple art forms, he obviously engages our space today with peerless virtuosity. Name it: from journalistic exertion of column-writing (In-Touch in The Nation) and show-hosting (TVC); to churning out, with prodigious frequency, critically acclaimed works of poetry, drama and prose.\n\nFor instance, since 2006, he has penned the widely acclaimed column weekly without a single break. And as his regular readers would attest, an encounter with Sam through the written words remains an enchanting voyage around art, history, philosophy and political thought.\n\nWith such remarkable testimonial in industry, Sam can then be said to be living out, even if symbolically, his own precept against, for instance, sloth in the civic space. Indeed, he demonstrates that his critical spirit over the years as a columnist is not hypocrisy. That he, by no means, is not an armchair critic. Through the power of personal example, he is thus able to rise to the very high standards he chooses to hold those in leadership perches as a public intellectual.\n\nIt can then be understood why, after several awards in punditry, the nation\u2019s custodian of academic tradition, the Nigerian Academy of Letters, finally considered Sam worthy to be inducted into its hall of fame as an honorary fellow in 2018. (Co-awardees included Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Pro Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, and Segun Adeniyi, popular author and columnist). Next was a formal acknowledgement by the Nigerian state of Sam\u2019s prodigious talent last year with his investiture with the National Productivity Award by the Federal Ministry of Labour at a solemn ceremony in Abuja.\n\nHowever, this is not a mission to interrogate Sam\u2019s art, but extoll his humanity \u2014 a unique convergence of the values of decency, loyalty and generosity. In transcendental terms, talent, it bears restating, is meaningless without a character defined by higher personal virtues.\n\nYou may not agree with him all the time, but what can never be faulted his sincerity of purpose and the restless quest for the common good. Sure, there is never going to be a consensus on the best road to travel or policy option to make in the stated pursuit of the public cause. Such critical contestation will, of course, always be driven and defined by the values we share individually or by which ideological aperture we view civil engagements.\n\nHowever, at a time when championing of sectional agenda seems increasingly glorified and entrepreneurs of hate scramble for visibility, one point that is beyond dispute is that Sam sticks to a different dialectics which rather view the nation\u2019s contemporary existential crisis through starkly distinct lens of the good Nigerian against the bad Nigerian. Like every conscientious artist, Sam remains unabashedly an advocate of the vulnerable and the voiceless in the ensuing dialectical struggle.\n\nIn identifying suspects or classifying culprits, his own objective yardstick is, therefore, social justice, regardless of tongue or faith. Against the backcloth of a rising call for the annulment of the national union, there can be no mistaking the persistently conciliatory standpoint of this gangling teetotaler from Niger Delta married to a Yoruba lady (from Ido-Ani in Ondo State), fluent in Yoruba, based in Lagos and whose circle of friends and allies cuts across all ethnic categories.\n\nIt is a perhaps a measure of his consistency of character that prominent among the company he keeps or would be found are still the same folks with whom he associated decades ago. Indeed, any audit of Sam\u2019s engagement in the past three decades will also show an unfailing fidelity to progressive ideals and the fierce defense of the common good.\n\nThe goodwill that fetches, it would seem, saved him in the dire hour of need in the dark days of Sani Abacha. On the fateful night he was to depart to the United States in 1997 to begin a one-year Alfred Friendly Fellowship, a little drama ensued at Muritala International Airport, Lagos. It was the harrowing season when critical voices were either in graves, gulag or exile. Being a prominent Concord journalist, Abacha\u2019s roving goons easily spotted him in the crowd in the departure lounge and brusquely asked him to step out of the queue before clamping him in an improvised detention around.\n\nWhile the state agents later stepped away to a quiet place apparently to consult their masters on what to do with a \u201cbig catch\u201d, a conscientious officer from another branch of the security service who had monitored the proceedings from a distance and would rather identify and sympathize with those courageous enough to stand up to the rampaging military dictatorship, miraculously came to Sam\u2019s rescue. Quickly, he whisked him through the remaining security cordons to his seat on the waiting aircraft which door was firmly locked almost immediately for take-off!\n\nSo, given that close shave, Sam was forced to remain in exile at the end of his fellowship at Denver, Colorado. Rather than being intimidated, he only intensified his sorties from exile against the military in form of critical essays published regularly in Concord titles which by now had become the main opposition publication in Nigeria.\n\nBut, overall, regardless of his habitual retail of lofty ideas with sometimes fierce words, the essential Sam is soft at heart, almost childlike in spirit. This accustomed innocence or instinctive trust has however often predisposed him to be easy target for traitors or emotional blackmailers. I dare say this as someone with intimate association with him in almost three decades, first as junior professional colleague and eventually a friend close enough to be considered a brother.\n\nIn the office environment, Sam certainly lacked the guile that many others would traffick in \u2014 that cold-heartedness to knife colleagues in the back, if only to rise rapidly on the ladder or gain favour. His mirth is genuine, not to be confused with the saccharin laughter of the treacherous who, as the Yoruba say, will conceal blood on the tongue and spit out phlegm.\n\nOn a personal note, it took the exile years for me to appreciate, in more intimate terms, two of Sam\u2019s defining qualities \u2014 a sense of solidarity and loyalty on the one hand and material generosity on the other. When Sun newspapers started in 2003 and I became the pioneer editor of the Sunday title, he put at my disposal the totality of his professional support, offering invaluable editorial advice. To ensure I succeeded, he began to write a weekly column for us and became our resourceful, omni-present \u201cspecial contributor\u201d from US, never failing to file rich human-angle stories and analyses every week.\n\nUntil his final return to Nigeria in 2006 to take up an appointment as Chairman of The Nation editorial board, I doubled as Sam\u2019s literary agent locally. I attest that all his earnings by way of honoraria for newspaper writings and academic papers were given out as charity to people, sometimes total strangers whose pain or misery he merely read or heard about.\n\nAt a reception hosted in Lagos by Benita Obaze of Bevista in 2013 to mark my 40th birthday, Sam accepted without hesitation to be co-master of ceremonies, not minding the wide age gap between us.\n\nSuch is his power to give his all for joy and upliftment of others.\n\n*** Odion is the Senior Technical Assistant on Media to the President.",

Faruk Yahaya, the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), to end the Boko Haram insurgency in the shortest possible time.\n\nAl Mustapha, who is a former Chief Security Officer (CSO) to late Gen. Sani Abacha, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Sunday.\n\nHe said the new army chief must ensure speed in ending the insurgency which had led to massive destruction of lives and property.\n\n\u201cDelaying the fight against Boko Haram will be a great disservice to Nigeria. The earlier we crush them, the better.\n\n\u201cSpeed is very vital, because we are not fighting a conventional war, speed matters a lot because Nigeria should recover from this speedily as much as possible.\n\n\u201cI know this is possible because I have done some homework,\u201d Al Mustapha said.\n\nThe former CSO congratulated the new COAS on his appointment.\n\n\u201cHe is our younger brother, I have prayed for him and wished him well on the appointment.\n\n\u201cI spoke with him and what I sent to him in a text message were prayers for him to succeed.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways for him to succeed in overcoming the numerous security challenges bedevilling the country, \u201d he said.\n\nAl Mustapha advised the new army chief to work in synergy with other security agencies to ensure success.\n\n\u201cMy advice is that the army should not be alone because it is not a military affair alone.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram for example has been on for more than 20 years from my account, that is from conception to its maturity.\n\n\u201cIf you want to contain an insurgency, every single detail of its activities should be on your palm, that is when you can say am on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cYou have to get their sources of logistics, their electronic support and capabilities, what they do on daily basis and how they get information among others, \u201d he said.\n\nAl Mustapha said the army chief must also trace the sources of arms getting into Nigeria resulting in arms proliferation.\n\n\u201cOur security challenge also has its root in the grand design by some powerful countries as far back as 1972 to retard Nigeria\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the country is facing security challenges from all facets at the same time.\n\n\u201cOur past mistakes have to do with viewing issues from narrow perspectives and that is why we must be very wide and open now,\u201d he said.\n\nAl Mustapha said the military must hasten its pace in tackling security challenges facing the country so it can return to barracks as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe need to end all these challenges as quickly as possible, so that the military can go back to the barracks to face its primary role of protecting the territorial integrity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInternal security operation has reduced the value of the military because they are taking over the role of the police, which is a disservice.\n\n\u201cWe have to end these crises so that the police can effectively take over their function, train and expand their capacity, \u201d he said.

The earlier we crush them, the better.\n\n\u201cSpeed is very vital, because we are not fighting a conventional war, speed matters a lot because Nigeria should recover from this speedily as much as possible.\n\n\u201cI know this is possible because I have done some homework,\u201d Al Mustapha said.\n\nThe former CSO congratulated the new COAS on his appointment.\n\n\u201cHe is our younger brother, I have prayed for him and wished him well on the appointment.\n\n\u201cI spoke with him and what I sent to him in a text message were prayers for him to succeed.\n\n\u201cThere are different ways for him to succeed in overcoming the numerous security challenges bedevilling the country, \u201d he said.\n\nAl Mustapha advised the new army chief to work in synergy with other security agencies to ensure success.\n\n\u201cMy advice is that the army should not be alone because it is not a military affair alone.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram for example has been on for more than 20 years from my account, that is from conception to its maturity.\n\n\u201cIf you want to contain an insurgency, every single detail of its activities should be on your palm, that is when you can say am on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cYou have to get their sources of logistics, their electronic support and capabilities, what they do on daily basis and how they get information among others, \u201d he said.\n\nAl Mustapha said the army chief must also trace the sources of arms getting into Nigeria resulting in arms proliferation.\n\n\u201cOur security challenge also has its root in the grand design by some powerful countries as far back as 1972 to retard Nigeria\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the country is facing security challenges from all facets at the same time.\n\n\u201cOur past mistakes have to do with viewing issues from narrow perspectives and that is why we must be very wide and open now,\u201d he said.\n\nAl Mustapha said the military must hasten its pace in tackling security challenges facing the country so it can return to barracks as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe need to end all these challenges as quickly as possible, so that the military can go back to the barracks to face its primary role of protecting the territorial integrity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cInternal security operation has reduced the value of the military because they are taking over the role of the police, which is a disservice.\n\n\u201cWe have to end these crises so that the police can effectively take over their function, train and expand their capacity, \u201d he said.",

Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

          "text": "The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has joined the rest of Nigerians to commemorate the 2021 Democracy Day, with a call for the need for more respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the Commission Tony Ojukwu, made the call on Saturday in the nation\u2019s capital, Abuja as Nigeria marked another Democracy Day.\n\nOjukwu noted that despite the progress made in the nation\u2019s democracy, the country continues to suffer human rights violations resulting from security challenges, youth unemployment, recurring mass atrocities and crimes, kidnappings, incessant extra-judicial killings and torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, discrimination, injustice and gross inequalities, rape, sexual and gender-based violence, and above all, impunity, weak institutions and lack of political will to hold perpetrators accountable for several types of human rights violations.\n\nHe, however, believes that these challenges can be curtailed \u201cif we speak the universal language of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms which are the foundations of any democracy\u201d.\n\nRead Also: Democracy Day: Use Of Teargas Was In Line With Global Standards \u2013 Police\n\nHe added that democracy and respect for human rights are interdependent and mutually reinforcing \u201cthe principle of non-discrimination, justice and equality before the law are key in building an inclusive and egalitarian society which leaves no one behind\u201d.\n\nThe NHRC boss further called on Nigerians to use the opportunity of the ongoing constitutional reforms to make meaningful contributions to the constitutional amendments so as to have a peaceful and egalitarian society free from discrimination, injustice, inequality and rancor where everyone will be happy and fulfilled as a citizen.\n\nSpeaking further, the human rights Chief said, \u201cit is imperative to preserve rights to life and avoid wanton extrajudicial killings in our democracy, asserting that all human beings are born equal in dignity and rights\u201d.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the government at all levels to redouble efforts to preserve the lives of citizens by among other things protecting our boders and eliminating the arms and weapons of destruction that are flocking into Nigeria and have littered our land.\n\nOjukwu lamented that reports have shown that the proliferations of small arms and lights weapons have only ended up making us a people not shocked by violence anymore as we bury our dead victims while the producers and their allies smile to the bank. \u201cWe must join hands to support the government in its efforts to stop this dastardly act\u201d he added.\n\nHe also enjoined Nigerians not to lose hope but to be optimistic and support the government in building the nation of our dreams \u201cwhere people will travel without the fear of being kidnapped or robbed, where our children will be in school and we will be at work in peace, where our youths are gainfully employed and shun crime and violence, and businesses will flourish in an enabling environment\u201d.\n\nOn killing, maiming and destruction of government properties at this critical time of nationhood, Ojukwu called for the stoppage of such violent and criminal conduct and advised on dialogue and other democratic ways of settling contentious issues in nation-building. \u201cThere are better and more civilized ways of expressing grivances\u201d he said.\n\nHe commiserated with families of law enforcement personnel who lost their lives in these barbaric attacks and condoled with the families of innocent citizens who may have lost their lives in the cross fire following response to these attacks on police and INEC infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe Executive Secretary used the opportunity to commend the Federal Government for recognizing June 12, as the democracy day in Nigeria.\n\nHe opined that while it is important to recognize the political actors during the June 12 elections, the people who conducted the election should also be remembered, because that election of unequaled credibility in Nigeria was conducted by Prof Humphrey Nwosu and his National Commissioners, Resident Electoral Commissioners, Directors and other staff. It will be justice if these citizens who made June 12 democracy day possible by conducting the freest and fairest elections in Nigeria\u2019s history, who at the risk of their lives challenged the military government in court for the annulment of June 12 election, are equally honoured, this is not beyond the government. This can become a model for National rebirth and call for patriotism and nationalism amongst Nigerians.\n\nFinally, he pledged the commitment of the NHRC to continue to educate Nigerians about their rights and responsibilities in order to inculcate the culture of respect for human rights in them emphasizing that law enforcement and human rights are mutually reinforcing rather than being anti each other as perceived by most law enforcement personnel.\n\nHe, therefore, called for more cooperation and understanding between law enforcement agencies and the Commission as we celebrate our democracy because the primary purpose of law enforcement by the government in a democracy like ours is the security of life and property (protection of human rights) of the people.",

          "title": "Despite Cryptocurrency Ban, Twitter CEO Dorsey Says Nigerians Will Lead Bitcoin Charge",
          "text": "According to Mr Okung owing to the unstable current global economic environment, the fate of the Nigerian economy lies in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people.\n\nThe NFL star had asked the Nigerian government to adopt a national bitcoin standard or risk falling behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\nTwitter CEO and billionaire co-founder Jack Dorsey, is extremely bullish on the future of bitcoin in Nigeria. He says Nigerians will lead bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value. \u201cThe people of Nigeria will lead #bitcoin \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec,\u201d he said in a tweet on Sunday.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cThe hope of Nigeria lies within this generation. I am proudly a Nigerian descendant living in America and am a proponent of Bitcoin. I write to urge the Nigerian government to pursue economic independence and financial sovereignty by pursuing a national Bitcoin standard. Soon every nation will be faced with this decision, but those who seize the present moment proactively as we have just witnessed in El Salvador, will enjoy significant advantages globally for generations to come.\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that the current global economic environment is worrisome and unsustainable. Sadly, the fate of the Nigerian economy is in the hands of global central bankers who do not represent the best interests of the Nigerian people. Despite the challenges we face, the resilience of Nigerians continues to inspire. The Nigerian society enjoys more favorable conditions than many of its neighbors. However, even greater opportunity awaits with the adoption of national action in favor of a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cThe tone of this letter is meant to convey urgency both in terms of the forthcoming economic despair and the limited window to act on this opportunity with fierce boldness and strong leadership. While the challenges of COVID-19 and increased global unrest continue to instill fear in the hearts and minds of citizens everywhere, Nigerians can claim international greatness by rising to the occasion that our unique times require.\n\n\u201cNations such as Iran, Russia, China and Kenya have been reportedly mining or otherwise utilizing bitcoin, often as a means to circumvent U.S. sanctions which prevent them from full participation in the global financial system. Other nations like Barbados, Singapore and Malta have moved to become \u201cbitcoin friendly\u201d in an effort to attract wealth and human capital through migration. And this week, El Salvador became the world\u2019s first nation to require merchants to accept bitcoin as legal tender. I\u2019m proposing an equally aggressive approach to national Bitcoin adoption which would significantly bolster every sector of the Nigerian economy and revitalize the spirit of every Nigerian domestically and abroad.\u201d\n\nIn the letter the NFL star says what\u2019s needed for the Nigerian economy to be reshaped is bold leadership with clear vision for a new future as the country does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is not controlled, managed or operated by any single entity. It is an innovation that will surpass the automobile or the internet in terms of its impact on humanity. Nigeria does not need to ask for permission from any other nation nor acquire a license nor secure a trade agreement from any corporation to reshape its economy with Bitcoin. All that is required is a vision for a new future and an allocation of its own national resources to pursue a Bitcoin standard,\u201d Mr Okung told the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe primary reason for urgently pursuing and executing a national plan for adoption is the finite supply of bitcoin. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin in circulation. This hard cap on the supply makes bitcoin even more verifiably finite than gold. As this simple yet unique property of scarcity becomes more widely understood, the economic laws of supply and demand will create a global frenzy to acquire as much bitcoin as possible, before it\u2019s too late. This momentum for acquiring bitcoin is already underway throughout the world and it is rapidly accelerating. In recent months, continued economic turmoil and uncertainty has created increased curiosity in bitcoin.\n\n\u201cMultiple institutional investors have announced sizable bitcoin allocations in their portfolios, some citing it as a hedge against a weakening U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government, along with every other government in the world, has a once in a generation opportunity to claim global prominence by rising to the occasion. Many other politicians in Latin America have signalled their intention to pursue similar moves as El Salvador.\n\n\u201cIn leading the next global financial shift, Nigeria can create prosperity for its citizens in a manner that requires no bloodshed, no election and no resistance. Such a proposition may seem too good to be true, and these ambitions certainly require thorough investigation, scrutiny and debate. Conversely, a delay in pursuing a national plan for bitcoin adoption will risk a scenario where Nigeria is left behind and its citizens excluded from the possibility of significant wealth creation and preservation.\n\n\u201cAs world leaders become more aware of the chance to make history, pursuit of bitcoin will be widespread. We offer our full support, a willingness to voluntarily consult and commitment to activate every resource available to us in order to see Nigeria pursue a Bitcoin standard.\n\n\u201cNigeria must never carry last.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

Blocking, filtering and censorship, plus the possibility of criminal prosecution, limit access to information and stifle online debate. State manipulation of the information that citizens are permitted to see (and not see) online also impedes the right of access to accurate information\u201d, they added.\n\nThe applicants argued further that disrupting access to the Internet services hinders the full enjoyment of a wide range of fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly the right Articles 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13(1) and 16 of the African Charter.\n\nThey said: \u201cThe Twitter ban adversely impacts on ordinary lives by preventing people fromcommunicating, harming businesses and livelihoods. In practical terms, it impacts most adversely on the poorest people, who are less able to afford alternative or more costly means of communication thereby creating unjustifiable discrimination, promoting inequality, and unlawfully impinging on the dignity of persons contrary to Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nIn its resolution on the Right to Freedom of Information and Expression on the Internet in Africa, the commission recognises the role of the Internet in advancing human and peoples\u2019 rights in Africa.\n\nThe applicants argued that, \u201cThe current ban on Twitter in Nigeria clearly contravenes the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, issued by this honorable commission, according to which \u2018States shall not interfere with the right of individuals to seek, receiveand impart information through any means of communication and digital technologies, through measures such as the removal, blocking or filtering of content, unless such interference is justifiable and compatible with international human rights law and standards.\u201d\n\nTobi Soniyi",

          "title": "June 12: Nigerians Stage Protests Nationwide",
          "text": "Nigerians on Saturday staged protests and rallies around the country to mark the second anniversary of declaration June 12 as Democracy Day and protest the state of affairs in the country.\n\nAnd in what has been widely condemned as double standard, the Nigeria Police protected and permitted pro-President Muhammadu Buhari campaigners to hold a solidarity rally in Abuja without any form of harassment, while at the same time disrupting the rallies organised by anti-Buhari groups in many parts of the country, using teargas.\n\nA mega rally organised for the president by his supporters, who trooped to Unity Fountain in Maitama, Abuja, to celebrate Democracy Day, was populated by dozens of youths drawn from the Youth Coalition for Development (YCD). They closed a section of the Shehu Shagari Road to traffic.\n\nInterestingly, there was heavy security in place, including a helicopter, which hovered above to protect those at the rally convened by Aminu Aminu.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to the riotous atmosphere at the Gudu area of Abuja, where activists, led by Omoyele Sowore, who were opposed to the Buhari administration, clashed with policemen who were sent to disperse them with teargas. The police also dispersed anti-Buhari marchers in other parts of the country, like Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Abeokuta,\n\nBut the Federal Capital Territory Police Command justified its decision to disperse the anti-government protesters.\n\nMany of those who showed up for the solidarity procession for the president were clad in branded white T-shirts with the inscription, \u201cI Stand With Buhari, How about You?\u201d boldly on the shirts. They also held placards bearing messages, like \u201c#IStandwithBuhari\u201d, \u201cWe are Indivisible\u201d, \u201cWe stay as one, We are Nigeria!\u201d\n\nOne of the president\u2019s supporters also carried a declarative message that read: \u201cProtest is only about getting your voice heard not a means of changing the government\u201d.\n\nSpeaking with reporters at the rally, the organiser said the solidarity march was put together in recognition of the efforts of many people, who campaigned and laboured to institute a culture of democracy in the country since 1993. He lauded Buhari for recognising the importance of the day.\n\nAminu said, \u201cJune 12 is a watershed in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s democratic history. It is a day to celebrate the beginning of a consistent and ideological struggle that eventually gave birth to a foundation for the democratic renaissance Nigeria is now building.\u201d\n\nBut, earlier, the police teargased a group protesting at the Gudu area of the Federal Capital Territory. Sowore, the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, led the protesters comprising many youths and middle-aged persons. They said they were gathered to protest against the prevailing insecurity in the country.\n\nThe anti-Buhari rally began about 8.30am and was peaceful until the police stormed the area and started firing teargas to disperse the rally. The Gudu road was also cordoned off while traffic flow was disrupted as a result.\n\nThe development forced the protesters, who carried placards bearing inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari must go\u201d, \u201cSay no to injustice\u201d, \u201c33.3% Unemployment Rate is Criminal\u201d, \u201d Digital Right is Human Right\u201d, to scamper to safety.\n\nThe FCT Police Public Relations Officer, Yusuf Mariam, in a statement said policemen had to disperse the protesters to prevent members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others from \u201cinciting public disturbance.\u201d Mariam added that calm had been restored around the axis and said nobody was arrested.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cFCT Police foils attempt to incite public disturbance, disperse members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria and others\u201d, Mariam stated, \u201cThe FCT Police Command on Saturday, June 12, 2021, successfully restored calm at Apo-Gudu axis after professionally dispersing a protest by some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria \u2013 Shiites and others targeted at inciting public disturbance and breaching public peace.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the action of the command was necessitated by the concerns of some agitated residents. However, no arrest was made.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the command wishes to state that it is committed to ensuring that FCT residents enjoy a hitch-free Democracy Day celebration and will not hesitate to bring to book every person or entity that attempts to breach the peace or cause a breakdown of law and order in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe command implores residents to remain calm and law-abiding while reaffirming its unwavering commitment to the protection of lives and property within the FCT.\u201d\n\nIn Yola, the Adamawa State capital, residents staged a protest and demanded a revolution to change the present leadership of Buhari, citing incompetence in handing the country\u2019s affairs. The protesters, who came under the banner of #Buharimustgo, defied a heavy rainfall and continued their protest for about three hours, demanding good governance and a leader who would pull Nigeria out of its numerous challenges.\n\nThey also called on Buhairi to relinquish power, brandishing banners of #revolutionnow, which asked Buhari to quit immediately.\n\nSporting black T-shirts marked with inscriptions, such as \u201cBuhari Must Go\u201d, the protesters chanted, \u201cFreedom comes by struggle\u201d and maintained, \u201cwe must come together to salvage our nation\u201d.\n\nLeader of the group, Tony Sudan Gompwel, told journalists that Buhari and other political leaders had failed the country.\n\nGompwel stated, \u201cThe kind of political leaders we have in our nation cannot give us the desired change.\u201d He said bad leadership was the reason the country was bedevilled by insecurity and economic backwardness.\n\n\u201cThey are hardened, they are tyrants, they are bankrupt of ideas. That\u2019s why great Nigerian youths are converging all over the nation to demand that they should leave the stage,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHowever, while the protest against the Buhari administration subsisted, his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Adamawa State read out Buhari\u2019s scorecard to residents to mark the second year of designating June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, who was represented by Honourable Abdulrazask Namdas, commended the Buhari administration. Namdas, a member representing Jada, Ganye, Toungo and Mayobelwa Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, said the celebration was also to intimate the citizens of the performance of the APC in the state.\n\nAt the event held at Muna Hotel, Yola, to mark the June 12 celebration, the scorecards of all serving senators and House of Representatives members from the state, and that of Buhari, were read out.\n\nAdamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri praised the courage and desire of the citizenry to allow democracy thrive after two decades of uninterrupted process.\n\nFintiri, in a press release by his Press Secretary, Mr. Humwashi Wonosikou, commended the electorate for trusting him with their mandate.\n\nThe governor said in the release, \u201cWe will continue to ensure we keep to our promise \u2013 a government that is a progressive instrument of the common good, rooted in our values of opportunity, responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their lives in a difficult period made worse by the dwindling economic hardship.\n\n\u201cOur desire to strengthen democracy and give it its true meaning informed the investment we are making in the social reengineering of the state through the provision of infrastructure and human capital development needed to unlock the growth and development of the Adamawa of our dream. The projects spread across the state represent the value and meaning of Democracy Day.\u201d\n\nIn Lagos, it was quiet in most parts of the state even though there were reports of skirmishes between protesters and men of the Nigerian Police at the Gani Fawehinmi Park at Ojota.\n\nAt the Mile Two area of the state also, there were reports of violent confrontations, which were promptly quelled by security operatives.\n\nHowever, all was peaceful in known flashpoints in the state, like Oshodi, Ojodu-Berger, Ojuelegba, Fagba, and Ketu, as many residents celebrated the June 12 Democracy Day in their homes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that although the protesters at Gani Fawehinmi Park were peaceful initially, it was the attempt by the police to forcibly disperse them from the venue that resulted in a face-off, leading to the use of teargas by the police. There were no reports of casualties or injuries.\n\nThere were no reports of breakdown of law and order in any other part of the state, even though many businesses were closed.\n\nIn Iju, Agege, Ojodu, Ikeja, Abule Egba, and Ogba areas, many people were indoors as commercial buses also stayed off roads.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that security was normal in most of these places, as no policemen and other security agents were noticed on the streets, and traffic was light.\n\nSpeaking on the conduct of the police, human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, SAN, said even though he had to go and effect the release of some youths arrested by the police, he was glad that there were no reports of killings. He said the situation was remarkably better than the previous months.\n\nFalana alleged that last year, the Nigeria Police had no canister of teargas to quell protests, hence their resort to the use of live bullets, as happened during the #EndSARS protest.\n\nFalana, who spoke at the 25th Anti-Corruption Situation Room organised by the Heda Resources Centre, disclosed that it was the lack of the teargas canisters that led to the killing of 99 persons during the October 2020 protest.\n\nIn Edo State, protesters called on the federal government to deliver good governance and adequate security, stating that the ineptitude of Buhari has brought Nigeria to its knees. The protesters, who began their match at King Square (Ring Road), Benin City, were provided security by the police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, and the state vigilante group. They accompanied the protesters to the Government House, where the Deputy Governor, Comrade Philip Shaibu, received them.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of about seven groups of protesters and civil society organisations, Marxist Kola Edokpayi of the Talakawa Assembly, lamented that the nonchalant attitude of the president towards security of life and property had brought the country to its present unacceptable situation.\n\nEdokpayi said, \u201cThe ineptitude of President Buhari has brought us to this sorry state. His nonchalant attitude has caused a lot of security problems. It has been difficult to combat Boko Haram, banditry and kidnapping. Nigerians now live in fear and nobody knows what will happen next.\n\n\u201cWhat we now hear is \u2018unknown gunmen\u2019 who are killing people in the South-east, while other parts of the country are becoming unsafe to live in because of insecurity. The prices of goods and services are moving up daily beyond the reach of the common man.\u201d\n\nResponding, the deputy governor commended the protesters for conducting themselves peacefully and promised that all their grievances would be channelled to the right quarters.\n\nShaibu used the opportunity to speak on some political issues in the state. He said of the 14 state lawmakers whose seats were declared vacant, \u201cWe did everything possible to have them in the House but they decided to follow a godfather, who misled them. Even with a month until their seats would be declared vacant, we urged them to join the assembly but they were asking for a second proclamation.\n\n\u201cThey also went to court and that had stopped the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting a fresh election. The INEC has said no new election can be conducted until the cases are decided. So, we have to wait for the courts before the next move can be made.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, governors and prominent Nigerians across the country, yesterday, spoke on the second anniversary of June 12 as Democracy Day, focusing on the swirling frustrations in different parts of the country.\n\nKWARA\n\nGovernor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State says the country has made progress despite its current challenges, which include the challenges of nation building, population bulge, and insecurity. In a statement issued in Ilorin on Saturday by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, to commemorate June 12, the governor said, \u201cI felicitate with Kwarans, and, indeed, all Nigerians, on this day of June 12, which has come to symbolise the struggle of our people for human rights, participatory democracy, and development.\n\n\u201cWhatever the challenges of nation-building confronting our fatherland, the truth is that we are pacing ahead in all indices of development while institutions of democracy are growing stronger and getting more mature.\u201d\n\nGOMBE\n\nThe Gombe State governor, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya, yesterday, praised Nigerians for resolving to maintain democracy as the means of governance, saying 22 years of interrupted democratic rule has proven naysayers wrong. Yahaya said Nigeria\u2019s \u201cdemocratic maturity has shattered the myths about African democracy being under the grip of one single leader or political party.\u201d\n\nHe noted that as the largest country in Africa, Nigeria would continue to hold the torch of nation building, democratic pluralism, and political stability in Africa and the world at large.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of uninterrupted democracy, I make bold to say Nigeria\u2019s democracy has come of age. We have witnessed successful transitions of power from one administration to the next, and from one political party to another,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nBAUCHI\n\nBauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, saluted the courage and patriotism of all democrats \u2013 dead or alive \u2013 who strived to ensure that democracy was well grounded in the country.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the governor said, \u201cWe laboured together to arrive where we are today and we shall continue to march the state forward to greatness with determination and sincerity of purpose with your support and prayers.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who explained that his two-year journey in power had not been a bed of roses, added, \u201cBut with determination and the support enjoyed from the good people of the state, we were able to pilot the affairs of government to a sound socio-political pedestal.\u201d\n\nEKITI\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, urged Nigerians to be more determined in ensuring that democracy worked in the country. Fayemi said despite its imperfections, democracy remained the best option for the country, adding that through the determination of the citizens and their active participation in the democratic process, Nigerians can achieve a truly great country of their dream.\n\nHe urged Nigerians not to relent in their search for lasting peace as a necessary condition for progress and prosperity.\n\nThe governor saluted the heroic deeds of patriots, who worked assiduously to actualise democratic rule in the country, especially, the symbol of the June 12 struggle, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, saying only a truly great, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria can be a befitting compensation for their sacrifices\n\n\u201cWe may not have reached the promised land, but we have left Egypt. We may not have attained the best, but we surely have made some progress as a nation,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nABIOLA\u2019S DAUGHTER\n\nHafsat Abiola-Costello, one of the daughters of the presumed winner of the June 12 1993 presidential election, Chief Moshood Abiola, said her family would not forget the role played by the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, in ensuring that their late patriarch was immortalised for his contribution to democracy. Abiola-Costello also praised the minister for his role in the renaming of Kudirat Abiola Road, in memory of her mother, who was brutally murdered during her struggles to regain the stolen mandate of her husband.\n\nShe said long before President Muhammadu Buhari came in as president, Aregbesola, who was then governor of Osun State, had embarked on a one-man campaign to press for recognition of Abiola as winner of the 1993 election and, indeed, to be recognised as a former president.\n\nOGUN\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun said the best way for Nigerians to immortalise and celebrate the acclaimed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, the late Chief MKO Abiola, and June 12, was to build bridges and demolish sectarian fences. Abiodun stated this on Saturday in his speech at the 2021 Democracy Day celebration, held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Kuto, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nThe governor, who said Nigerians could not afford to bring down the country or despair in its future, noted that the supreme price paid by the Abiola and his mandate should serve as a reminder that Nigerians were stronger together as a nation.\n\n\u201cUntil Nigerians embrace the essence of the MKO persona, internalise belief in self, faith in a united country and other initiatives that help to engender a sense of shared heritage amongst Nigerian people, we will continue to be a country in search of nationhood,\u201d he said.\n\nAbiodun urged Nigerians to push all the negative and divisive forces and policies on the back-foot and embrace the symbolism of June 12, saying, \u201cLet us join hands to make Nigeria work for all Nigerians. June 12 represents what will strengthen the country\u2019s unity, indivisibility and oneness.\u201d He added that such unity would end all quests for self-determination and other sectarian agitations, as well as calm frayed nerves.\n\nBAYELSA\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, expressed his administration\u2019s determination to change the development narrative of the state. Diri spoke on Saturday at Government House, Yenagoa, during his maiden media chat that was broadcast live on all Yenagoa-based radio stations.\n\nThe media interaction was part of activities to commemorate this year\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nThe governor, in a press statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, said democracy was about the people and Nigeria had come a long way with 22 years of uninterrupted civil rule, which he said had not been smooth but worth celebrating.\n\nHe noted that the urban renewal programme and other projects and policies of his administration were part of the drive to give the state a new look and make it more attractive to investors.\n\nDiri said the state had a lot of tourism potential and the government was open to discussion and ready to sign memorandum of understanding with partners to develop projects in the sector.\n\nOn the federal government\u2019s infrastructure development refund to the state, the governor clarified that the actual amount it received was N27.5 billion and not N38.4 billion, as being speculated in some quarters.\n\nHe explained that though the total refund due the state was N38.4 billion, according to the federal government, its release would not be possible in the next four years. He said the state was offered a second option of a discounted amount of N27.5 billion through the Debt Management Office, which it got last December.\n\nResponding to a question on President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent directive to revive cattle grazing routes across the country, Diri said there were no such routes in the state. He explained that although he was not countering the federal government\u2019s decision to resuscitate grazing routes, his administration had put in place a legal framework to ban open grazing and movement of cattle on foot.\n\nThe Bayelsa governor also emphasised that the southern governors had adopted the same position on the issue as part of measures to check farmers/herders clashes across the country.\n\nDiri maintained that his government could not afford to expose its citizenry to the looming danger.\n\nKADUNA CAN\n\nChairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, said June 12 could not be celebrated as Democracy Day because Nigerian leaders were not democratic. Hayab said Nigerians could not be governed by intimidation and still celebrate June 12 as Democracy Day.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY on Saturday, Hayab said in a true democracy, there was rule of law and freedom of speech.\n\nAccording to him, June 12 is merely a date set aside by the government, though there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating.\n\nHayab stated, \u201cWe are simply celebrating a date set aside by the government but there is no evidence of democracy worth celebrating. The spirit behind June 12 is supposed to make our current leaders truly democratic but what we see is governance by intimidation and creating fear in the minds of citizens.\n\n\u201cA true sign of democracy is the freedom citizens enjoy and respect for the rule of law, which is visibly absent in the way we have been governed in this country. I wish the government should have remembered that in a few days or in the second week of June. We will have this day to be reminded to celebrate before announcing the ban on Twitter and many uncomplimentary comments about other regions by the president.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom said he was not against Buhari as a person but often disagreed with him on the constitutionality of issues and policy. Ortom said those who insinuated that his disagreement with the president was bone out of hatred were wrong. He stated that the attack on him would not force his administration to repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in the state.\n\nThe governor declared that anyone who thought the state government would be intimidated to repeal the law was making a great mistake. He said his administration was trying to amend the law to increase the penalties against anyone who flouted it.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Banquet Hall of Government House, Makurdi, while giving his midterm scorecard as part of activities marking this year\u2019s Democracy Day, Ortom said, \u201cI have always prayed and supported the president but when it comes to issues of fairness and illegality, I will disagree.\n\n\u201cThe law on ranching has come to stay and no amount of intimidation can make us to repeal it. Instead, we will soon amend the law in order to increase the penalties against offenders.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who listed his administration\u2019s achievements in the areas of education, agriculture, infrastructure, and health, among others, lamented the humanitarian situation caused by the continued attacks by armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in Benue communities.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe security threat from armed herdsmen, bandits and other criminals in our communities has resulted in wanton killings and the displacement of people in large numbers across the state.\n\n\u201cToday, Benue State has over one million IDPs with many of them living in the camps we have set up and others staying with their relations. The situation has created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the state.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the huge sums of money his administration had been spending to cater for the Internally displaced persons, resources were always inadequate because the number of IDPs increased daily.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cMy desire is to ensure that the IDPs return to their ancestral homes. Most of them are farmers, and the longer they stay in the camps, the more food production is affected. We hope that the federal government will also fulfil its promise to assist Benue and other states in the North-central, which have been badly affected by the attacks to resettle the victims.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that many of his colleagues had been coming around to encourage him on his stand to hold the presidency accountable over insecurity in the country but were too afraid to talk.\n\nTHISDAY",
