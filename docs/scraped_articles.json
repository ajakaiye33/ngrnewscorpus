          "title": "Antibiotics abuse in children could affect brain development, researchers warn",
          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nResearchers have warned that exposure to antibiotics early in life could alter human brain development in areas responsible for cognitive and emotional functions.\n\nAccording to the researchers from Rutgers University, USA, there is a need to reduce widespread antibiotic use to prevent neurodevelopment problems.\n\nIn the study published in ScienceDaily, the researchers said.\n\nPenicillin and related medicines (like ampicillin and amoxicillin) are the most widely used antibiotics in children worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe laboratory study suggests that penicillin changes the microbiome \u2013 the trillions of beneficial microorganisms that live in and on our bodies \u2013 as well as gene expression, which allows cells to respond to its changing environment, in key areas of the developing brain.\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest reducing widespread antibiotic use or using alternatives when possible to prevent neurodevelopment problems.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, the average child receives nearly three courses of antibiotics before the age of two. Similar or greater exposure rates occur in many other countries\u201d, the researchers said.\n\nThe study, they noted, compared mice that were exposed to low-dose penicillin in utero or immediately after birth to those that were not exposed.\n\nThe researchers found that mice given penicillin experienced substantial changes in their intestinal microbiota and had altered gene expression in the frontal cortex and amygdala, two key areas in the brain responsible for the development of memory as well as fear and stress responses.\n\n\u201cA growing body of evidence links the phenomena in the intestinal tract with signaling to the brain.\n\n\u201cIf this pathway is disturbed, it can lead to permanent altering of the brain\u2019s structure and function and possibly lead to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders in later childhood or adulthood,\u201d they added.\n\nLead author and Director of the Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine at Rutgers, Martin Blaser, said, \u201cOur previous work has shown that exposing young animals to antibiotics changes their metabolism and immunity.\n\n\u201cThe third important development in early life involves the brain. This study is preliminary but shows a correlation between altering the microbiome and changes in the brain that should be further explored.\u201d\n\nBlaser noted that early life is a critical period of neurodevelopment.\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, there has been a rise in the incidence of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and learning disabilities.\n\n\u201cAlthough increased awareness and diagnosis are likely contributing factors, disruptions in cerebral gene expression early in development also could be responsible\u201d, the author stated.\n\nSenior Registrar in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Alex Ekwueme University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Dr. Amuche Nwafor, told our correspondent that there was a need for pregnant women to desist from going to patent medicine dealers to buy antibiotics when they are sick.\n\nThe gynaecologist warned that the use of antibiotics in pregnancy without a doctor\u2019s prescription has a devastating impact and can cause deformities and jaundice in babies.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Nwafor said it is cheaper and safer for pregnant women to visit the hospital when they are sick rather than patronising patent medicine dealers.\n\nThe physician says that maternal health experts discourage the use of antibiotics in pregnancy because not all of them are safe.\n\nShe said, \u201cGenerally, we discourage drug use in pregnancy as much as possible. We only use antibiotics in pregnancy when it is extremely necessary. Some antibiotics are not safe during pregnancy. Some of them will affect the foetus negatively. Antibiotics can cause deformity in the baby. It can also affect the bone.\n\n\u201cThere are, however, some that are safe. But the problem is that some pregnant women, when they are sick, go to the chemist to buy drugs, not minding the impact on their unborn baby.\n\n\u201cDoctors don\u2019t just give antibiotics. Even when they want to give, they give the safe ones.\n\n\u201cSome antibiotics can affect the bone marrow also. Others can cause jaundice, brain damage and also affect the skin.\u201d\n\nThe gynaecologist also noted that antibiotics can cause miscarriages.\n\nIn a 2020 study published in BMJ journal, researchers stated that children of mothers who were prescribed macrolide antibiotics during early pregnancy are at an increased risk of major birth defects, particularly heart defects, compared with children of mothers whose doctors prescribed penicillin for.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\u2022It help to foster unity and development in Igbo land \u2014 Abia monarch\n\n\u2022Becoming less influential due to changing times \u2014 Emenyeonu\n\n\u2022The system is drawing us back, should be discarded \u2014 Akwukwuegbu\n\n\u2022It is part of Igbo identity, culture, can\u2019t do without it \u2014 Don\n\n\u2022Igbo will harm themselves more if they abandon it \u2014 Anaekwe\n\n\u2022Offers security to members of the family \u2014 Igbo leader\n\n\u2022Extended family brings unity in the entire community \u2014 Anambra residents\n\nBy Anayo Okoli, Vincent Ujumadu, Chimaobi Nwaiwu, Ugochukwu Alaribe, Chinonso Alozie, Steve Oko & Nwabueze Okonkwo\n\nThe concept of extended family system is a recognized, well known age long practice in Igbo land. It is a practice where many relations, including distant ones, depend on other capable relations for upkeep, education, training, apprenticeship and general survival. It is a practice that has worked in Igbo land for long. It is a sort of multi-generational family. In Igbo culture, the core of the family is the nuclear family: the parents and their children, while additional relatives are considered extended. It is the type of family unit that has multiple relatives other than just the parents and their children living in the same household. Despite what Ndigbo see as a lot of advantages of the extended family system, however with the steady dwindling Nigeria economy, many now doubt the sustainable of the system.\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the key characteristic of the extended family is that there are multiple adults in the family that are not parents of the children, though they may also have parent-like roles and share in the responsibilities for providing for the whole family one way or the other.\n\n\n\nOne of the advantages of an extended family system is the kind of security it offers to the members of that family. In an extended family, for example, members believe that they have people on whom they can count on in times of needs and even in times of trouble. One of the occasions on which the system helps a lot as large number comes into play is during funerals, weddings and other major events that require huge money and combined efforts. On occasions like these, the extended family helps in raising money, running the errands and generally in organizing the occasion to ensure it succeeds.\n\n\n\nAnother advantage of the extended family system is that it brings unity to the entire community. The blood relationship that exists among all the cousins, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, etc., brings about peace and this peace leads to unity that extends into the larger society. It has also been observed that in times of financial or emotional crisis, the wealthy members of the family render help to other not well to do family members. For instance, if a boy secures admission to study in the university and the biological father is in capable of paying the fees, a member of the extended family easily usually wades in to sponsor such a person. Also, a sister who is about to get married could get assistance in many forms from the members of the extended family to ensure that everything goes smoothly.\n\n\n\nThe extended family system in Igbo land comes to great play when a man dies leaving the children with no inheritance or support. In this case, the uncles and aunties and other members of the extended family could take over and raise the children on behalf of the deceased brother or uncle without the children going through much stress. This cannot be found in a nuclear family system.\n\n\n\nAccording to a community leader, Chief Gabriel Emenyonu, the head of Onyema extended family of Umuobasi in Omoho in Anambra State, although extended family is becoming less influential in many Igbo communities due to the changing times, it used to be the pivot for human and capital development in many communities. The family meetings, he said is usually organized during annual festivities are periods when members of the family settle disputes among them, evolve ways of assisting family members in need of assistance and visiting their sisters married out.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with South East Voice, Emenyonu said: \u201cWhat is today an extended family for us began sometime in 1962 when the first son of my late brother wanted to travel to the United Kingdom for further studies. Because his biological father could not shoulder the responsibility alone, the entire family contributed to send him abroad. By the time he finished his studies in 1967, the civil war broke out and he remained abroad throughout the period of the war.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 1970, the family re-established contact with him and he facilitated the process that enabled two other children of his uncles to join him. Those two other young men who travelled in 1972 have also helped other members of the extended family to acquire education abroad.\n\n\n\n\u201cCurrently, we fix our family meeting for every 3rd of January and every member and people, whether living abroad or in Nigeria, attend the meeting during which we discuss matters of interest for the entire extended family.\u201d\n\n\n\nSome members of the extended family, he further explained, had also been assisted to go into business and the trend has continued till date. The entire members of the extended family, he added, bear the cost during the burial or marriage of any member of the family.\n\n\n\nEmenyonu however, observed that one of the disadvantages of the extended family system is that some members tend to manifest selfish attitude that is inimical to the peaceful coexistence of the unit.\n\n\n\nFor Eze Ndubuisi Nwabeke, the Chairman of the Abia State Council of traditional rulers, the extended family system has helped to foster unity and development in Igbo land and called for the sustenance of the system. The monarch, however, explained that the sustenance of the system depends on the capacity of the individual to extend assistance to both close and distant relations.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with South East Voice, Eze Nwabeke said that the prevailing economic downturn in Nigeria has made it more difficult for people to extend traditional assistance to their extended families.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe extended family is an age long practice in Igbo land where wealthy members of a family extends assistance to both close and distant relations. When the father of the family dies in a polygamous family, it becomes the responsibility of mostly the first son to take care of the welfare of both his siblings and other distant relations in the areas of education, training in various trades and even upkeep of the entire family. These close and distant relations include brothers, sisters, uncles, nieces, step brothers and sisters and sisters\u2019 in-laws and wives married to the family. It promotes unity in the extended families. Extended family system has helped to foster growth and development in Igbo land.\n\n\n\n\u201cExtending assistance to the family, extended family members and even others in the society is very much encouraged and it attracts divine blessings. Nothing stops anyone to extend assistance to both their family members and other people outside their families in their times of need. The sustainability of this system depends more on the capacity of the individuals who are to extend assistance to their relations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe monarch stated that it is viewed as an act of wickedness if the first son or any wealthy member of the family refuses to cater for the extended family after the death of the father of the family.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the first son or any other well-to-do member of the family refuses to cater for the extended family, it is seen to be an act of wickedness. Extended family system is in line with the Igbo policy of being your brother\u2019s keeper.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his contribution, the Traditional Prime Minister of Ibeku ancient kingdom, Chief Uche Akwukwuegbu (BAWAS), said that the extended family system in Igbo should be discarded. The practice according to him is burdensome and weighing down capable ones among relations.\n\n\n\nAkwukwuegbu, who is the National President, Nigeria Association of Traditional Prime Ministers, NATPM, said that the present economic realities no longer favours the sustainability of the practice despite its merits in promoting family ties and brotherly affection.\n\n\n\nHe observed that so many capable ones in Igbo land had been drawn backwards because of the burden of extended family members and advocates that individuals should try to work hard and save for the future so as not to be parasites to other family members or relations.\n\n\n\n\u201cExtended family system has weighed me down. The practice is no longer necessary and sustainable. The white man\u2019s system is better. Our system is dragging so many capable people backwards because of the attendant burden.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverybody should endeavour to work hard and train their children so that in their old age those children will, in turn, take care of them. The most annoying aspect of it is that some people will expect you to carry them and still carry their children and grandchildren for them. If you carry too much burden it will break your back\u201d, Akwukwuegbu said.\n\n\n\nCorroborating Akwukwuegbu\u2019s position, Mr. Blessed Uchenna, a trader in Umuahia, said family responsibilities should not be shouldered by one member of the family else \u201che will collapse\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Imo state-born trader, who said he already had a feel of carrying burdens of extended family members, noted however that blood ties among relations make them not to close their eyes against their own.\n\n\n\nHe, however, said that many businessmen had collapsed due to excess luggage forced on them by extended family members. This is like a family where the man is the person working and the woman has nothing doing. You will discover that it could get to a point where the man\u2019s income may no longer sufficiently sustain the family.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe, therefore, strongly advised every member of the family to strive to earn a decent living and not constitute any burden to other members of their extended family.\n\n\n\nBut a university lecturer, Mrs. Onyebuchi Oko believes that the extended family system should be sustained, arguing that \u201cit is part of our culture\u201d.\n\n\n\nShe said that shying away from extended family responsibilities is alien to Igbo culture. According to her, despite the worsening economic situation in Nigeria, Igbo identify should not be discarded.\n\n\n\nIt is part of us. We can\u2019t do without it. It is part of our culture. Some Igbo names and phrases like Igwebuike, Umunnabuike, Onyeaghana Nwanneya, represent the culture of extended family system.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt should be sustained but there should be a re-orientation among our people. The youths should be encouraged to embrace skill acquisition for self sustenance. This will lessen dependence on others.\u201d\n\n\n\nhas help Igbo immensely.\n\nSpeaking with South East Voice, Chief Anaekwe, said that extended family system is one of the best cultural practice Igbo forefathers left behind for Ndigbo.\n\nsaying that it should not allowed to go into extinction. Anaekwe cautioned that every Igbo family to maintain the system if they want to keep progressing to the envy of other tribes that do not practice it. He said that the system be sustained and discouraged anything that will put a stop to it, including bad women whom he said married into the families as wives who usually work towards destroying it.\n\n\n\nAccording to Anaekwe, \u201cextended family system is one of the best cultures and traditional practice our forefathers created and left for us, and it will never cease to exist; wherever you find the extended family system, you find progress, success, development, peace and unity, nobody goes hungry and life becomes sweet and worth living.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnywhere or any family in Igbo land where extended family system is not practiced, you will find out that it is because of bad women brought in as wives into the families, the women who came either from different states, local government, tribe; it is mostly from different tribes, maybe it is not practiced in their tribe, because of their own culture and they try to fight to discourage it when they come in.\n\n\n\n\u201cAgain many of our women who studied overseas are practicing what they learnt there in Europe, America and other Western world where they believe in \u2018me, my wife and children only\u2019, and in most of such families and cases, women dictate the pace in such situations and you will find out that peace and progress do not reign in such families.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo extended family system in Igbo land is our culture and it makes us to be one among the equals, distinguishes us from others in all ramifications; it makes us to be our brothers\u2019 keepers, and it is one of the reasons why Igbo individually and generally compete in terms of wealth than other tribes, if they are not even the richest among the tribes in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe essence of the extended family system and why it is working positively for Ndigbo is because if you are rich, you will extend it to your relations in the extended families; your paternal and maternal relations and the wealth keeps growing and development and progress keep expanding.\n\n\u201cThe only place we are having problem with it is from our women who are manner less, selfish and self-centered who want everything to themselves and they should not be encouraged by our men; they must be stopped and made to key into our extended family system otherwise, they should forget about progress in their families. Such women when they come in the first thing they want to do is to put confusion and crisis to separate you and your siblings, and when she succeeds in separating the siblings she will take it to the extended families, mostly those whose husbands are rich, they are bad women with evil intentions and must not be allowed to continue if we must continue to be Ndigbo we are. Any attempt by anybody to stop, discourage our extended family system practice should be resisted otherwise we are finished as Ndigbo and families.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother area we have problem sustaining our extended family system is from our people who studied abroad who want to import foreign culture to us. They must be stopped and made to key into the system. We must continue to encourage and pray for the existence of extended family system in Igbo land because it has done us more good than harm, it has assisted us in all ramifications, it must continue among the Igbo because its benefits are enormous.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you check in Nigeria today at least three million Igbo are feeding well and the reason is this ability to help each other through extended family system, unlike in other tribes where if they are seven million, six and half million are not feeding well, and that is the envy against the Igbo. People are being jealous of Ndigbo without knowing the secret behind their success. Igbo believe in extended family system, they believe in relationship with their people and I encourage every Igbo family and community to keep up the practice, encourage it and stop all those women who want to destroy it.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cThe concept of extended family system cannot be thrown away in Igbo land; it is a highly recognized and well known system in the long years of our culture and tradition. Without extended family system we are nowhere. Many people in Igbo land may not be what they are today if not for the extended family practice, many relations close and distant, were able to go school, set up businesses through their capable extended family relations. Some are enjoying good upkeep, educational training, apprenticeship and general survival based on noble practice of extended system; it is sustainable and we must endeavour to sustain it for a better future of Ndigbo\u201d, Anaekwe insisted.\n\n\n\nFor Owerri, Imo State resident, Chief Mike Ejiofor the extended family practice is good and still in practice though not without its challenges. He said one of the advantages was that it has produced chains of wealthy families, successful personalities in different areas of life, but on the other hand the practice has been slowed down because of ingratitude, fear of intimidation from those that got help from you.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough this practice of extended family system, many successful persons you see in the society became what they are today. As of then, there was trust, love and people were showing gratitude to each other and were eager to see how many people they empowered.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was like a competition in those days. I am not saying it is not happening now but not as we saw it in those days that members of our extended family can come together and build a house for one of them, help them get married and take care of their children when one is not around.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fears of some people now are that when you help people around you, they come back with ingratitude, they come to intimidate you, take your rights and oppress you so much that you cannot have what belongs to you again.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany are regretting today while they assist others not because they do not want to do it. It is because what they get in return, it is all about pains. It is worst now in the family where the only thing that matters is which family is richer and not how to help others. It is a competition of which family is powerful. They no longer talk of how to help\u201d, Ejiofor said.\n\n\n\nIn his contribution, the traditional ruler of Owerre Nsukka Autonomous Community in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, Dr. Emeka Felix Ugwu, said extended family system can only work in families where love thrive.\n\n\n\nThe monarch, who said that unhealthy rivalries and greed among extended family members have choked the love which sustained the system in Igbo land in the olden days, added that in families that love one another, extended families served as ladder through which younger members attained successes in trades, education, and skills acquisition training.\n\n\n\nHe equally said that the system helped households to accomplish reasonable agricultural attainment where every member of the family participated in farm works.\n\n\n\nHe, however, bemoaned unhealthy rivalries and insatiable quest for materialism which characterizes most extended families now, saying unless something is done to reverse the ugly trend, the system has become counterproductive.\n\n\n\nFor Chief Boniface Ezenenwu, an automobile engineer based in Onitsha, Anambra state, the importance of extended family cannot be over emphasized. Ezenenwu, the immediate past chairman of Nigerian Automobile Technicians Association, NATA, Anambra state chapter, said the system was responsible for Ndigbo not engaging in begging for alms like in other tribes where begging is rampant.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ezenenwu, because of the extended family system, many Igbo sons and daughters are being trained in various fields of human endeavour by the extended family members who are rich enough to sponsor others.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is only of recent that I started seeing Igbo people begging for alms unlike before. Ndigbo are always ashamed of begging because their well to do extended family members do not allow them to go hungry or to be found wanting.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am therefore urging other ethnic tribes to emulate Ndigbo in terms of embracing the extended family system\u201d, Ezenenwu said.\n\n\n\nIn his contribution, Nze Dozie Nweke, President of Aborji Akanano Union, AAU, Oba, Idemili North Area Council, extended family system is the same thing as one\u2019s maternal and paternal relations and in-laws.\n\n\n\nAccording to Nze Nweke, during a funeral, marriage or chieftaincy installation ceremonies, it is the responsibility of the extended family members to assist their man or woman financially or otherwise to ensure that such ceremonies are performed successfully.\n\n\n\nNweke therefore urged extended family members not to allow their members to suffer from hunger and starvation in the midst of economic crunch, adding that on the other hand an extended family member should not kill or harm fellow members as observed in some cases.\n\n\n\nIn his view, Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka, said it is the extended family system that make Ndigbo unique and make them stand tall among other ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nFor Chief Hyman Udema, a titled chief in Obosi, Anambra State, \u201cextended family life in Igbo land is an ideology that knows no bounds in terms of prevailing economic situation at any time.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a systemic practice gone down with generations that would endear generations to come. Sustainability is not dependent on abundance but on commitment and natural pledge\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has called on top Christian leaders such as pastors WF Kumuyi, Enoch Adeboye, Bishop David Oyedepo, and others to rise to the occasion and come to the rescue of the students abducted from different schools in the North East.\n\nBamgbose reiterated CAGG\u2019s willingness to work round the clock to ensure that all the 348 students abducted in Kebbi, Niger, and the Kaduna states are released before the end of this month, adding, \u201cWe won\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nThe group further appealed to the abductors of the students to grant it more time, adding that something will be done in a matter of days, It added that its earlier deadline to get the students out of captivity which ended this week, was not feasible.\n\nSpeaking with DAILY POST on Wednesday, Bamgbose said, \u201cIt is evident from the news about the abducted 121 students of the Bethel Baptist Church, Kaduna, that the students will soon regain their freedom.\n\n\u201cThe abductors have decided to reduce the ransom to N60m. As said earlier on, our group will work round the clock to ensure that all the 348 students abducted in Kebbi, Niger, and the Kaduna States are released before the end of this month. We won\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the bandits for more time as something will be done in a matter of days, yesterday deadline was not feasible.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t give up on Nigeria yet \u2013 Presidency urges citizens to emulate Kumuyi\n\nBamgbose said that all hands must be on deck to ensure that the students regain their freedom before month-end.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, I will call on the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, Christian Association of Nigeria, and church leaders to come to the rescue of these innocent and hapless students,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe should not at this critical time abandon the Baptist Church. We should be our brother\u2019s keeper. We cannot claim to be Christians when we neglect to assist others in times of need.\n\n\u201cI will therefore urge Pastor Kumuyi, Pastor Adeboye, Pastor Oyedepo, and other prominent men of God in Nigeria to rise to the occasion and come to the rescue of these students.\n\n\u201cPreaching is not enough, we must practice what we preach. If any of their children were abducted and N60m was demanded, one is sure that they will pay the ransom.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we are talking of 120 souls. God may hold them accountable if they refuse to act timely. If any of them could contribute to the Federal Government during the COVID-19 saga, why won\u2019t they do the same to rescue these students?\n\n\u201cWe urge the bandits not to harm the students as something will be done shortly. Hopefully, by next week we shall, other things being equal, come up with Save Our Students Fund, SOS Fund.\n\n\u201cIt will be an appeal fund to rescue the abducted students. We must show concern for our fellow Nigerians irrespective of their tribe and religion.\n\n\u201cThe unifying factor is that we are Nigerians bonded together by divine purpose to be one nation. We won\u2019t allow the bandits to waste the lives of our future generation. Together we can make Nigeria a better place to live.\u201d\n\nDeeper Life Pastor, Kumuyi warns against calls for Nigeria\u2019s breakup",

          "text": "The Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, yesterday inaugurated the 260,000 capacity first private cemetery in the state, saying the concept will avert environmental hazards and safeguard the health of the citizens.\n\nThe Governor spoke in Ado Ekiti while inaugurating the \u2018CitiGate Park and Gardens Cemetery\u2019 located in the Eminrin area of the state capital.\n\nFayemi, represented by the Commissioner for Environment, Barr. Iyabo Fakunle-Okieimen, submitted that the smooth take off of the business was a testimony that the state is encouraging private investors to invest their hard-earned monies in the state .\n\nThe Governor said: \u201cWith this investment by a private body, Ekiti is no longer a rural setting. In the USA, Britain and other European countries, you can\u2019t just bury your dead at home. Aside from the fact that it causes groundwater pollution, it devalues our buildings and reduces its aesthetic values.\n\n\u201cThis is a public-private initiative, but will be driven largely by the private owners. We appeal to the drivers of this business to try and replicate this across the 16 local governments of Ekiti State, so that our late parents can be buried easily in cemeteries that are neater and well laid out.\n\n\u201cThis is cheaper compared to what you can get in Lagos and other cities and our people can now bring their dead parents home to be buried from other parts of the country\u201d.\n\nFayemi assured that every step will be taken to support business owners in Ekiti through the relevant legal framework and giving of tax waiver.\n\nAlso speaking about the prospect of the business, one of the company\u2019s directors and former Ekiti Deputy Governor, Surv. Abiodun Aluko, said the concept of a private cemetery is universal, owing to growing population and Ekiti should not be exempted from the emerging global civilisation .\n\n\u201cThe land we have here can accommodate 260,000 corpses. But this pilot scheme we are starting is for only 260 corpses with the hope to expand in future until we exhaust our land resource to full capacity.\n\n\u201cWe have provisions for both christains and Muslims. With time, we will build event facilities like hall and church here, where people can hold their burial procession and even reception close to the cemetery to minimise cost,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ayodele Olaiya, who said the investment was a Public-Private Partnership, added that it will generate revenue into government\u2019s coffers and prevent outbreak of epidemic diseases.\n\n\u201cIn this part of the world, we drink majorly from boreholes and wells, so cemetery should be far away from homes in order not to endanger our health\u201d, Olaiya said.\n\nBodies of 11 slain soldiers arrive military cemetery in Makurdi",

          "text": "By Elo Edremoda, Warri\n\nA group of Urhobo/Isoko ex-militants in the Niger Delta have decried their exclusion from appointment into the inaugurated Committee on Strategic Communications of the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP).\n\nThey accused the interim administrator of the PAP, Col. Milland Dixon Dikio (retd.) of \u201csidelining\u201d them and urged him to appoint one of their own into the 10-member committee.\n\nIn a statement by the group\u2019s chairman and vice chairman, General Figbele Joseph and General Adu Solo, the ex-agitators described their exclusion from the committee as an \u201cinjustice\u201d, one they intend to resist.\n\nThey posited that having one of their own in the committee will ensure fairness.\n\nParts of the statement reads: \u201cThere is no gainsaying that the Urhobo-Isoko ex-agitators are completely sidelined in the novel committee, hence we will take every necessary move to make sure that this injustice is resisted.\n\n\u201cCol. Dikio, shouldn\u2019t forget we are his subjects, captured in the Presidential Amnesty Programme that are entitled to every entitlement of the programme. Sidelining us is not a good option.\n\n\u201cTaking our humility and peaceful conduct for granted will not help sustain the existing peace in the region. Therefore, we are calling on relevant authorities to help us call on Col. Dikio to quickly appoint an Urhobo/Isoko ex-agitator into the novel committee for us to also have a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cOver the years we have been deprived and treated like a beggars in the PAP having embraced peace and subsequently captured into the programme. But we have resolved never to accept any form of injustice from anybody for any reason whatsoever.\n\n\u201cConsequently, while we are appealing to him to act fairly as a father and coordinator of the programme, he should do the needful by appointing an Urhobo/Isoko ex-agitator into the Strategic Communication Committee for fairness and justice\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA novel committee on Strategic Communications was constituted and inaugurated by the PAP administrator in Port Harcourt, Rivers State in May, with a mandate to be a \u201cthink tank and change agents\u201d of the PAP.\n\nThe committee was established at the backdrop of a workshop on Strategic Communications organised for selected ex-agitators earlier in March.",

While the EEFP is being implemented by the NEPC, the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade & Investment is the supervisory body over the agency and its operations.It was disclosed that although the programme anticipated 500 beneficiaries.But since its launch, it has received over 3,500 applications for the grant, out of which over 2,000 were verified after meeting the eligibility criteria.\n\nGovernment officials say further details and plans on disbursement to final successful beneficiaries are being awaited.\n\nAside from being an intervention to save and create jobs, Adebayo noted that the programme \u201cwill support resilience in shoring up foreign exchange, diversification, modernisation of Nigeria\u2019s economy and acceleration of economic growth and economic support.\u201d\n\nUnder the EEFP, there are 16 programmes as approved in the Implementation work plan under seven workstreams namely \u2013 capacity building, emergency interventions, export aggregation, export inclusion, export trade facilitation, institutional strengthening and market development.\n\nFor instance, the emergency intervention is to support existing exporters in responding to shocks caused by COVID-19, while market development involves penetrating identified export markets, value chain analysis for priority products, leveraging African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and other trade treaties.\n\nConsidering the significant role it plays in growing the Nigerian economy, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the target group of support from the EEFP and the Export Development Fund (EDF).\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nLeading lawyers, yesterday, swung into action to avert the repatriation of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemi popularly known as Sunday Igboho to Nigeria from Cotonou, Republic of Benin.\n\nThey claimed the way his house was raided by the Department of State Security (DSS) in collaboration with other security agencies in the early hours of June 1 showed he would not get justice if extradited to Nigeria.\n\nThey also said he had not committed any offence arguing that he was merely fighting for freedom for his people and self-determination which is recognised under the United Nations charter.\n\nLeader of the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), Emeritus Prof Banji Akintoye, also said frontline Yoruba patriots were working to provide assistance, saying, \u201cBenin Republic is a land that respect the rules of law.\u201d\n\nHe spoke amidst viral rumour that he had been released. It was even accompanied with a photograph aboard an aeroplane purportedly on his way to Germany, which his lawyer has denied\n\nThe activist was arrested alongside his wife, Ropo, a German citizen by men of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) while trying to board a flight to Germany Monday night.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer based in Texas, United States of America, Leesi Ebenezer Olarewaju, has ruled out the possibility of his repatriation.\n\nHe said: \u201cSunday Adeyemo can only be returned back to Nigeria if only he is found to have broken any law in Benin Republic. Sunday Igboho, as we know, did not break any law in Benin. He was arrested under false alarm raised by the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cWe are on top of the situation right now. We have successfully notified the British government on the dangers of letting Sunday Adeyemo be returned to Nigeria where his life is at risk. We believe that before the end of today (yesterday), Britain would have granted his request for asylum in good faith.\u201d\n\nCorroborating him, Igboho\u2019s lead counsel, Yomi Alliyu (SAN), said he cannot be extradited to Nigeria because of the extradition treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin.\n\nHe condemned the arrest which he described as impunity and called on the government of Germany, Benin Republic and the international community \u201cto rise up and curb the impunity of the Nigerian government by refusing any application for extradition of our Client who already has application before the International Criminal Court duly acknowledged.\u201d\n\nHis statement read: \u201cIt is a shocking news that Nigerian Government has gotten Chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a Sunday Igboho Oosa arrested by INTERPOL in Republic of Benin notwithstanding the political nature of his offence and what the DSS earlier said that they refrained from arresting him so as not to overheat the polity of Southwestern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\n\u201cNow, Article 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries. This made Chief Sunday Adeyemo a political offender who cannot be deported and/or extradited by the good people of the Republic of Benin for any reason.\n\n\u201cSecondly, that he cannot get Justice or even be killed is apparent in how those arrested in his house were detained for more than 21 days now without access to their lawyers. Even the wife among them could not change her undies for 21days! Which inhuman treatment can be more this?\n\n\u201cAgain, another wife of our client Mrs Ropo Adeyemo, a German Citizen, has been arrested together with her husband in Cotonou. What offence has she committed to warrant this?\n\n\u201cWe urge the good government of the Republic of Benin and international community, especially Germany, to rise up and curb the impunity of the Nigerian Government by refusing any application for extradition of our Client who already has application before ICC duly acknowledged.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Akintoye called on all Yoruba people within and beyond the shores of Nigeria to come out and ensure their ancestral land is not defeated by invaders.\n\n\u201cWhat the situation now calls for is that the Yoruba nation at home and in Diapora must stand strong, resolved that neither Sunday Igboho, nor any other Yoruba person will henceforth be subjected to inhuman or dehumanizing treatment of any kind.\n\n\u201cWe Yoruba nation are, by the grace of God, a very strong nation. We must arise now to show that strength. For a start, we must all see to it now that Sunday Ighoho will get his freedom back so as to be able to move and operate as a free person. We all know he has committed no crime.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people are trying to suppress or even eliminate him only because he stood up to defend his kinsmen, women and children who are being massively killed and raped in their ancestral home land; who are having their assets and means of livelihood destroyed, and who are facing ethnic cleansing and even genocide without having the benefit of protection by the rulers of their country.\n\n\u201cWe know, furthermore, that for the protection of his people who are being brutalized, he has joined hands with many of his brethren to take the legally-approriate step, namely to seek the intervention of the International Criminal Court.\u201d\n\nReacting, the Afenifere Renewal Group (ARG), in a statement by its chairman, Olawale Oshun and secretary, Ayo Afolabi, described Igboho as one of the leading activists against the unmitigated terror of herdsmen.\n\n\u2022Juju has failed, Joe Igbokwe taunts\n\nHowever, Joe Igbokwe, chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday mocked Igboho.\n\nIgbokwe sharing a photograph of Igboho wearing charms on his Facebook wall, taunted the Yoruba separatist leader\u2019s repeated bragging about his indomitability as an African traditional worshiper \u2013 often referred to as Juju \u2013 in separate instances where security forces tried to arrest him and he escaped.\n\nIgbokwe, who also taunted IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu after he was arrested and flown to Nigeria from Kenya, likened Igboho\u2019s arrest to the arrest of several IPOB members who also bragged about the potency of charms they wore as protection against police and soldiers attempting to arrest them.\n\nThe aide to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State wrote: \u201cJuju no de work again ooo. It failed in Igboland and it failed too in Yoruba and.\u201d\n\n\u2022God\u2019ll disgrace those running after him \u2013Cleric\n\nNot minding the taunt, a Christian cleric, Adewale Giwa has said God would disgrace those running after Igboho.\n\nGiwa, who is the senior pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Akure, said Igboho is a hero and should not be treated as a common criminal.\n\n\u201cNo cause for concern because the Lord will rise and disgrace those who want Sunday Igboho dead or incarcerated with a view to allowing their Fulani kinsmen take over the country.\n\n\u201cYou came to somebody\u2019s house without prior notice, destroyed his property, killed his people and arrested others. Yet, you are still running after him just because he is fighting against the Fulani killers who continue to murder and molest our people.\n\n\u201cDo not rob the poor because he is poor or crush the afflicted at the gate; For the Lord will plead their case and take the life of those who rob them. The Lord who stood with Ehud, Othniel, Gideon and other freedom fighters in the Scripture will stand by Sunday Adeyemo and defeat those running after his life.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "A member of the Board of Trustees of the All Progressive Grand Congress (APGA), Chief Rommy Ezeonwuka, has said that the leadership of the party would not allow intruders to hijack its primary election.\n\nIn a chat with Daily Sun yesterday, Ezeonwuka said the party nominated the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Prof. Charles Soludo, as its candidate and expressed worry that \u201cpeople jumped through the window to hijack the process.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Victor Oye led executive is in charge of the All Progressive Grand Alliance. We do not have any other executive. The party, in its primary election, has nominated Prof Chukwuma Soludo as its candidate for the election; but some people wanted to hijack it through the backdoor. Those who wanted to come through the window to take over the party will not succeed. The Victor Oye led executive came in through the door; it also elected Soludo through the front door. Therefore, the party cannot allow intruders coming through the window to take over the party.\n\n\u201cIn election time like this, people resort to all manner of gimmicks for selfish reasons. It is not a new trend.

          "title": "Buhari: News of Downed Fighter Jet Devastating, But Relieved Pilot Survived",
          "text": "Hails Dairo\u2019s gallantry\n\nBandits wanted me alive, says officer\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said he was initially devastated by the news of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet, which was downed over the weekend by terrorist bandits in Zamfara State, but that the survival of the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, who successfully ejected from the aircraft after it came under \u201cintense ground fire\u201d later relieved him.\n\nWhile Buhari, however, hailed the pilot\u2019s gallantry in the face of intense fire power, Dairo too said his survival was only made possible by God because the bandits wanted him alive than killing him after they knew he had ejected.\n\nThe pilot had finished a raid against kidnappers, when he came under intense fire, the Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said in a statement on Monday.\n\nBut Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several strongholds of the bandits by using the cover of darkness and his phone set to navigate and maneuver his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\nReacting to the development in a statement issued last night by a presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, President Buhari said he was pained by the news of the air crash.\n\n\u201cI was shocked by the devastating news of the air crash but felt much relieved, following the successful ejection by the pilot and his eventual rescue. May the injured pilot recover at the earliest time,\u201d President Buhari was quoted as saying.\n\nShehu said President Buhari had been briefed on the successful operation by the nation\u2019s defence forces to rescue the pilot, few days after armed bandits gunned down the military aircraft.\n\nThe attack happened on the border of the northern Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, had immediately commended the pilot for his bravery.\n\nIrabor, who met the pilot in company with the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, before proceeding to a meeting with military veterans in the North-west, commended the pilot for the gallantry and bravery he demonstrated in the fight against banditry.\n\nHowever, giving a personal account of what happened, Dairo, who declared that God made his survival possible as he waded through the stronghold of armed bandits in the Zamfara bushes at night until his rescue, said the bandits, who operated more like Boko Haram, were interested in capturing him alive than shooting him with the way they combed the bushes in search of him.\n\nIn a testimony he gave to his high school group in a WhatsApp platform, he said he prayed from the moment his plane was shot and throughout the ordeal and God answered his supplications.\n\nHe told his colleagues on the social media platform that prior to the incident, he had dreams of fighting and evading enemies.\n\n\u201cBefore Sunday I had been having dreams, where I saw myself fighting and evading enemies like real-time war, day in day out, like nightmares, so when my jet got shot with the explosives and my flight controls were destroyed and I had no choice than to eject, I just said \u2018God, finally, here we go\u2019.\n\n\u201cAs I was flanked by the bandits, I kept praying and I kept telling God to answer your prayers, because I know you (his group) were all praying for me. I love you all and I thank God for bestowing his love on me and saving me from death several times within that period\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI will still share my testimonies but truly God ordered my steps, the bandits (meanwhile they are ruthless like Boko haram, I don\u2019t know why we still call them bandits) were more interested in capturing me than shooting me (even at point blank range), eventually they got neither.\n\n\u201cHe gave me the strength to run and walk covering almost 30kms even with one strained leg. Having not had any food or water all day, I prayed for strength, because I needed it, and he gave me\u201d.\n\nFurther, the gallant pilot said, \u201cI can spend hours talking of how I lost and regained hope multiple times throughout my adventure but God is faithful. It\u2019s now that I feel all the pains I suffered from the ejection (including a fracture in my neck and painful back and chest) but God didn\u2019t allow those pains to slow me down for the bandits to capture me.\n\n\u201cNAF platforms overhead also helped me to deter them a lot by making some of them to pin down while I kept running, and when they got close to me, I was still able to evade them by camouflaging (I was wearing green fg suits \u2013 in the green forest) and concealing myself\u201d, Dairo said, adding that he encountered many obstacles in the forest but survived with God\u2019s help.\n\n\u201cI ran into plenty spiders and I laid down several times out of weakness not knowing if anything poisonous would sting or bite me. All glory is to God, all glory. I have not been your most righteous brother, but I felt God\u2019s hands in everything, even in every decisions I took immediately I was shot, all the decisions worked together to save my life\u201d.\n\nHe narrated that that he was able to remove his phone from his lap to his protective suit before pulling the ejection handle.\n\n\u201cFor example, removing my phone from my lap and putting it in my G -suit before pulling the ejection handle (I had to use the compass of the phone and AirNav Pro application to navigate), and making the decision to turn hard 90 degrees immediately the bandits lost sight of me on a sandy cliff, where they couldn\u2019t trace my footpath again (the CAS told me they got information that in turn, the bandits kept going straight in the direction I was initially going and they destroyed several villages and camps, killing plenty people, thinking those people harbored me).\n\n\u201cSo much more\u2026 the village I eventually entered at night, I told God that the first person I see and call should favour me and that happened, he gave me clothes, pain-relieving drugs, food and water and even malt, and he organised for a bike to carry me to Dansadau early next morning (throughout the night I couldn\u2019t sleep, I was praying that the bandits don\u2019t attack the village because my right leg was already swollen and very painful so I couldn\u2019t jump fences or run again, plus I didn\u2019t want to bring death upon innocent people, and it may force the guy to give me out to the bandits\u201d, he narrated.\n\nThe pilot said his helpers dropped him where he was picked up by soldiers.\n\n\u201cThey dropped me with the person, who with pride and joy called the army guys to come and meet me (they all had sleepless nights). NAF helicopters came to pick me up from there. There are so much to say. All thanks to God, thank you so much\u201d, he said.\n\nSpokesman of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet confirmed the pilot\u2019s testimony.\n\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s from the pilot. He sent it to his high school WhatsApp chat group\u201d, he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "As NERC updates list of meter providers\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigeria Electricity System Operator (NESO) has revealed that at its peak, Nigeria\u2019s power sector was only able to generate about 15.6 per cent of the total projected national daily requirement of 28.880 megawatts.\n\nNESO, a semi-autonomous arm under the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) is responsible for operating the transmission system in a safe and reliable manner.\n\nThe TCN network spreads to all parts of the country and across the border to several neighbouring countries. Nigeria is a net exporter of power.\n\nA trend analysis of data released by the system operator and compiled by THISDAY, indicated that despite the various financial interventions by the federal government, mostly through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the last seven years, only a paltry average of 4,500MW was actually generated every day.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which is fully owned by the federal government, is able to wheel the entire generation to Nigerian homes, sometimes, due to dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nThe data released by NESO showed that the country needs approximately 28.880MW, but is barely able to push 5,000MW for use by homes and business concerns in the country.\n\nIn the last seven years, the CBN was estimated to have pumped over N1.5 trillion into the sector, in over 23 instances through the Power and Aviation Intervention Fund (PAIF) worth roughly N300 billion, through the Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF), valued at N213 billion and the N140 billion Solar Connection Intervention Facility (SCIF).\n\nAdded to that, the apex bank has spent over N600 billion to augment tariff shortfall, plus a recent N120 billion intervention designed for mass metering, which is currently being deployed in the country.\n\nThe World Bank recently projected that the federal government could be paying as much as N3.4 trillion by 2023 if the current shortfall persisted.\n\nAccording to the Washington-based institution, only 22 per cent of the poorest households has access to electricity, with Nigeria now having the largest number of \u2018unelectrified\u2019 people globally after overtaking the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\n\nIn the weekly data released by the system operator, on July 14th, peak generation was a meagre 4722.7mw, lowest generation was 3442.5mw, which is a far cry from the almost 30,000 minimum power needed to electrify the country at every point.\n\nThe system operator put the nation\u2019s peak demand forecast for that day at 28850mw, although grid generation installed capacity still remained at 13,014 and transmission wheeling capacity peaked at 8100MW.\n\nAccording to the TCN, all-time peak ever attained in the country was 5801.6MW. It was same on July 15, when peak generation was only 4594.3MW, lowest power generated was 3419.8MW and highest voltage recorded stood at 351kv, according to the NESO data.\n\nSimilarly, on July 16, peak generation was 4042.4MW, while lowest generation was 2907MW, being one of the worst days during the week, the lowest voltage recorded was 300kv. It was 4598.6MW for peak generation on July 13, and 3310.5MW was its lowest generation.\n\nAlso, the data showed that on July 18th, peak generation was 4915.8MW, lowest generation was 3.413.3MW, while total generation capacity stood at 7652.6mw.\n\nNot much has been heard concerning the deal signed between the government and Siemens last year, to overhaul the power sector, although the Special Adviser to the Minister of Power on Media and Communication, Mr. Aaron Artimas, assured Nigerians last week that the deal had not been called off.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has released an updated list of Meter Asset Providers (MAP), comprising 15 meter manufacturers, 23 importers, three vendors and 58 corporate installers.\n\nThe list obtained by THISDAY indicated that the updated document now contains those who have just renewed their licences, which had earlier expired.\n\nThe commission noted that the corporate meter installers were classified into several groups, with class A1 certification authorising a holder to undertake installations at grid voltages exceeding five grid metering systems; low voltage single and three phase metering systems, including high voltage maximum demand installation exceeding 750 metering systems.\n\nNigeria currently has a rough energy mix, which is dominated by thermal, mostly gas-to-power of 75 per cent and hydro (water) of about 25 per cent power generating sources, although there have been recent noticeable attempts to rev up solar power use in far-flung rural areas by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Says he used cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation to elude bandits\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor, yesterday commended the pilot of the downed Alpha Jet fighter aircraft, Flt. Lt. Abayomi Dairo, for his bravery.\n\nIrabor, who met the pilot in company with the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, before proceeding to a meeting with military veterans in the North-west, commended the pilot for the gallantry and bravery he demonstrated in the fight against banditry.\n\nEarlier, the NAF had announced the crashing of a fighter jet in Zamfara State while returning from an interdiction mission.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the aircraft came under enemy fire, forcing Dairo to eject from the aircraft.\n\nIt said the crash occurred on July 18, 2021 at 12.45pm while the aircraft was returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna states.\n\nThe statement said the pilot after ejecting from the fighter jet, sought refuge in some settlements and evaded strongholds of bandits before locating a Nigerian Army unit where he was rescued.\n\nThe crash brings to four the number of military aircraft that crashed in the last one year.\n\n\u201cOn 18 July 2021, at about 12.45 pm, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft, returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna State, came under intense enemy fire, which led to its crash in Zamfara State. Luckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft.\n\n\u201cUsing his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset.\n\n\u201cUsing the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and manoeuvred his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot\u201d, it said.\n\nThe Air Force said Intelligence, Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships were activated to locate the pilot.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance 0(ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF.\n\n\u201cIt is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement recalled that only recently, President Muhammadu Buhari had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminals in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cIt is in fulfillment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last two weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these three states.\n\n\u201cThrough these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralised and several of their hideouts destroyed,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, while praising Dairo for his gallantry, Irabor, in a statement by Defence Headquarters, urged Nigerian Air Force pilots to remain steadfast in the war against banditry.\n\n\u201cBefore proceeding for the security parley, the CDS, Gen Irabor, in company of the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, met with Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, the NAF Alpha jet pilot, who survived the air crash yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe CDS commended the fighter pilot for his gallantry and bravery, which he demonstrated in the fight against banditry.\n\nHe encouraged NAF pilots to remain steadfast in the task of national security,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIrabor, who also met with military veterans, lamented the rising state of insecurity in the North-west.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe necessity of this gathering today, which is of course to engage with you (military veterans), and by extension the larger society, is partly what is responsible for the safe return of our cherished pilot. We believe that going forward, greater gains will be made as we undertake this operational task.\u201d\n\nIrabor, who spoke at the second edition of security parley, tagged \u201cChief of Defence Staff Interaction with Retired Senior Military Officers in North-west Geopolitical Zone,\u201d held yesterday in Kaduna, said the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) was constantly reviewing its techniques, tactics and procedures as well as operational doctrines to be in tandem with the requirements for the containment of the security threats.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nmesoma Esther and her siblings were lost in their world as they roamed their three-bedroom flat. With little to worry about, they giggled at intervals and bounced around with reckless abandon. Esther was happy to enjoy the evening hours before having to face a familiar demon at night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nine-year-old girl suffers respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) \u2014 a breathing disorder among children which causes insufficient surfactant in the lungs.\n\nEvery night, Esther endures pain and discomfort due to her inability to breathe well. But her hope of overcoming the condition is continually dampened by the relentless activities of the artisanal refiners who operate behind her house every day.\n\nIn 2017, her family relocated to Ohanachiom street, Obigbo west in Oyigbo LGA of Rivers. Since their arrival at the new environment renowned for heavy pollution, her condition has worsened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy chest used to be heavy whenever I try to breathe. I don\u2019t also sleep well at night because I don\u2019t breathe well,\u201d she said, wearing a defeated look.\n\nDaily, Esther watches as soot filters through the windows and falls on the ceiling fans, curtains, TV, chairs, and furniture. Nothing in the house is spared.\n\nEsther\u2019s situation depicts a state of helplessness. But she\u2019s not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAririguzo Chidiebere(pictured), another resident of Ovim-street in Oyigbo LGA, could not hide his frustration.\n\n\u201cThe soot issue has been a hell of an experience for us. We\u2019re prone to catarrh always and we sneeze a lot. Most times, when you blow your nose, you\u2019ll notice everything is black,\u201d he said.\n\nSOOT, THE SLOW KILLER\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoot is the common term for a type of particle pollution called PM 2.5 \u2014 particulate matter with diameters that are 2.5 micrometers or less.\n\nIt is mostly formed as a result of the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, and due to its tiny size, it can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream easily.\n\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), soot is one of the deadliest forms of air pollution.\n\nPrecious Ede, a climate scientist and air pollution specialist at Rivers State University (RSU), said soot contains harmful chemical substances that can cause cancer and respiratory disorders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe harmful substances, the professor said, are heavy metals, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), polyclinic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), diesel fuels, mineral oils, benzene, toluene and xylenes.\n\nIn spite of its deadly nature, residents of Rivers have continued to grapple with it.\n\nFollowing the outrage that trailed its prevalence in 2016, Nyesom Wike, the state governor, had commissioned a technical team in 2018 to investigate the factors causing soot pollution and how to tackle it.\n\nAccording to the report published in 2019, a copy of which was obtained by TheCable, illegal bunkering and gas flaring topped the list of activities causing soot pollution in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report \u2014 citing a review of hospital records across the 23 LGAs in Rivers \u2014 also revealed that 22,077 persons who received treatment for soot-related conditions between 2014 and 2018 suffered respiratory ailments.\n\nEde, who led the technical team, told the TheCable that findings showed there was \u201c30% increase in morbidity and mortality rates in Rivers state 16 months after the soot incident started in 2016\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that the soot is a source of the very harmful condition that is already killing people. We also looked at the results of laboratory analysis and projected possible rate of cancer occurrence among residents of Port Harcourt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd we were able to come up with information showing that thousands of people will come down with cancer annually as a result of soot.\u201d\n\nHarmful chemical composition of \u2018black soot\u2019 and effects on human health\n\nPollutants Health effects on residents 1. Arsenic Headaches, drowsiness, seizures, brain damage, diarrhea, low blood pressure, muscular problems, heart problem and intestinal bleeding. 2. Lead Brain damage, mental retardation, anemia, depression, insomnia and respiratory distress 3. Mercury Respiratory problems (asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc.) and neurological problems such as loss of memory, mental confusion and lack of concentration. 4. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), e.g., benzene, xylenes, mineral oils, diesel fuels \u2026 Decreased immune system, breathing problems, severe kidney and liver damage and mental problems. 5. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), e.g., naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene, phenanthrene, etc. Breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), jaundice, cancer, catarrh, kidney and liver damage, breathing problems and body stress.\n\nSource: Laboratory analysis of chemical characterisation of soot (Rivers state government\u2019s 2019 report) and interviews with experts.\n\nAirVisual\u2019s ranking of air quality in Port Harcourt between June and July 2021 showed that it is mostly unhealthy for the residents. On July 9, for instance, an air index of 152 was recorded for the city \u2014 far above the standard(0-50) and moderate(51-100) levels.\n\nAccording to Ede, people like the nine-year-old Esther with pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer serious health challenges due to the poor air quality in Port Harcourt and other parts of the state.\n\n\u2018DEPRESSED LUNG FUNCTION ACTIVITIES\u2019\n\nTo ascertain the effect of soot on residents, TheCable facilitated lung function tests and chest x-ray for 10 people living in areas where the scourge is prevalent.\n\nBased on the direction of medical experts, and to obtain reliable results, residents selected for the tests were neither smokers nor did they have any known pre-existing health issue.\n\nThe lung function test was carried out at the department of human physiology laboratory, college of health sciences, University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) while the chest x-ray was conducted at Splendour Diagnostic Centre \u2014 both in Obio/Akpor LGA.\n\nThe participants selected for both tests were within the age range of 22 and 33, and drawn from Port Harcourt, Oyigbo, Obio/Akpor and Ikwere LGAs.\n\nFor the lung function test, the parameters used include forced vital capacity (FVC) \u2014 the amount of air that can be forcibly given out from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible; and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) \u2014 the amount of air that can be expelled forcefully in one second.\n\nOthers are peak expiratory volume (PEF), which is the highest amount of expelled air; and FEV1/FVC, the ratio of the amount of air that can be expelled forcefully in one second to the total amount of air expelled.\n\nThe chest x-ray examined the heart size and contour, the lung fields, and the aorta, which is the main artery of the body supplying oxygenated blood to the circulatory system.\n\nThe bony rib cage and pleural effusion \u2014 abnormal, excessive collection of fluid next to the lung \u2014 were also examined.\n\nResults of the lung function test showed that none of the participants used \u2014 two females and three males \u2014 had standard lung function activities.\n\nOnly two of the respondents (40%) had \u201cfairly okay\u201d lung function activities while the remaining three (60%) had \u201cbetween depressed to seriously depressed lung function activities\u201d.\n\nGwotmut Dajen, chief medical laboratory scientist at UNIPORT\u2019s physiology department, said \u201cthe results fell short of standards expected of both male and female\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fact that on the overall, we don\u2019t have an up to standard subject among the five of them is an indication that there\u2019s a general depression of lungs function activities in these subjects,\u201d he said.\n\nDajen said the implication of the result is that the oxygen intake of the individuals is limited, which portends danger to their health.\n\n\u201cEnvironment, of which soot is one, is a major factor responsible for this,\u201d he added.\n\nKodu Baribe, a student of RSU who was one of the persons tested, wasn\u2019t shocked to discover that she has \u201cseriously depressed lungs activities\u201d. Baribe says she knows that the inhalation of soot must have taken a toll on her and others in Elele, Obio/Akpo where she resides.\n\n\u201cI am really not shocked. We know that the soot is a problem but nothing has been done about it. Sometimes, I notice the difficulty in breathing and chest pain from the accumulated dirt that comes from the air,\u201d she said.\n\nTheCable\u2019s findings corroborate a 2021 study, which examined the ambient air of Port Harcourt, and revealed there is \u201ca high probability of accumulation and toxicity in human tissues and health\u201d due to the poor air quality in the city.\n\nCHEST X-RAY SHOWED NO IMMEDIATE ADVERSE EFFECTS\n\nThe chest x-ray results of the participants showed that majority of them are relatively okay, as there were no issues with the sampled parameters among the individuals.\n\nBest Ordinoha, a professor of community medicine and environmental health at UNIPORT, explained that even though the chest x-ray results showed that the participants were normal, it does not mean they are not affected by soot.\n\nHe said the effect of the soot is based on the \u201cdefensive mechanisms\u201d of each person.\n\nOrdinoha, who is also a health consultant at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), added that the effect of soot can be immediate or delayed.\n\n\u201cThe immediate effects will include hypersensitivity reactions like asthmatic attacks and sneezing,\u201d he said.\n\nOrdinoha said some of the delayed effects in adults include increased risk of lung cancer and bronchitis while children are at the risk of having pneumonia.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, it takes a longer time for some of these adverse effects to manifest. So, basically, people will still feel the adverse effect but their body and lungs may appear okay because the vast quantity has been filtered out by those defensive mechanisms,\u201d he said.\n\nOrji Sunday, a former resident of Port Harcourt, told TheCable that soot pollution informed his decision to relocate from the city in November 2020.\n\n\u201cI left Port Harcourt because of the soot issue. It was prevalent around First Artillery axis of the state where I was living at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut unlike Sunday, many who have nowhere to go have resigned to fate, huffing and puffing while hanging on to the hope of a clean environment devoid of soot.\n\nGAS FLARING, BUNKERING BOOMING \u2014 BUT WHERE ARE THE REGULATORS?\n\nWhen Lukeson Oguchi returned to Mgbede community in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni LGA after his master\u2019s degree abroad, he was saddened by widespread pollution in the area.\n\nAlthough the 2019 study by the state government revealed that \u201ceradication of the soot depends on the reduction or complete extermination of the identified factors causing soot\u201d, TheCable found that not much has been done to stop the causal factors.\n\nIn several parts of Rivers, illegal bunkering and artisanal refining are lucrative businesses while those involved are mostly unchallenged by relevant authorities.\n\nAccording to Oguchi, the ease at which people carry out the illegal activities and the attendant profit remain a motivating factor for many residents.\n\n\u201cThey (illegal oil bunkers and artisanal refiners) make a lot of money daily and in my place, it\u2019s gradually becoming a business that every young boy and young girl wants to get involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere, if you invest N13,000 you will make up to 15,000 and 20,000 daily. Those who invest N2 million get up to N500,000 daily.\u201d\n\nThe negligence of security and regulatory agencies in addressing the situation was obvious during visits to Aggah and Okwuzi in Egbema; Rumuokparali waterside in Obio/Akpo; and Obigbo west in Oyigbo LGA.\n\nTheCable also found that products \u2014 such as kerosene, petroleum and diesel \u2014 from these illegal activities are openly displayed for sale in markets and within residential areas.\n\nJust like illegal bunkering, oil companies still openly flare gas at the detriment of their host communities.\n\nEbocha community in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni LGA, for instance, hosts the Ebocha Oil Centre owned by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited (NAOC).\n\nResidents said the company\u2019s operations have become a nightmare for them due to constant flaring of gas and oil spillages.\n\nAccording to Stanley Anyaladu, chairman of Egbema community development committee, the area has continued to suffer \u201cmassive pollution\u201d since Agip discovered oil in commercial quantity.\n\n\u201cThere has been massive pollution of our area since 1965 when Agip discovered oil in commercial quantity in Ebocha. Black soot is common because the volume of oil activities and degradation of the ecosystem is very massive here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLungs diseases and other respiratory issues are prevalent here. We also notice that some of us are already growing grey hair as early 18 and 19 years of age.\u201d\n\nEze Augustus, Ebocha\u2019s council of chiefs chairman, said the activities of Agip have contaminated the water and the environment.\n\n\u201cAgip has left us poorer than they met us because of their rule and divide policy. Our water has been polluted while we inhale soot and other harmful substances on daily basis due to gas flaring,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Finima, Bonny LGA of the state, there is also constant flaring of gas by the Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) and other companies.\n\nWarialabo Amoni Hart, chairman of Finima Environmental Protection Initiative (FEPI), said the government has turned a \u201cblind eye\u201d to the situation in the area which he claims has continued to kill people.\n\n\u201cIn Finima, there\u2019s high casualties of respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and health complications because of the soot from heavy gas flare. There\u2019s also serious concentration of lead poisoning in the marine life,\u201d he told TheCable. \u201cOil and gas companies such as NLNG, ExxonMobil and Shell international flare gas here. The government is aware that the citizens are being killed with pollution and that they should do something, but they\u2019re just turning a blind eye.\u201d\n\nNigeria is a signatory to the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights which states that \u201call peoples shall have the right to a general satisfactory environment favourable to their development\u201d.\n\nThe country has also ratified the Paris climate agreement \u2014 aimed at reducing global warming \u2014 while it is also a signatory to the Global Gas Flaring Partnership (GGFR) principles for global flare-out by 2030.\n\nIn 2016, the federal government launched the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP) \u201cto eliminate gas flaring through technically and commercially sustainable gas utilization projects\u201d.\n\nAt the state level, there\u2019s the ministry of environment \u201cresponsible for the promotion of a healthy and clean environment\u201d. There is also the federal ministry of environment established to tackle issues relating to activities causing the soot.\n\nSimilarly, there are several other federal agencies such as the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESRA) saddled with this responsibility.\n\nBut in spite of the existence of all these instruments and regulatory bodies, gas flaring, illegal bunkering, artisanal refining and other activities causing soot pollution are still rife in Rivers.\n\nAccording to the World Bank gas flaring tracker report released in April, Nigeria is among the top seven gas flaring countries in the world for the last mine years.\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S A DIVIDE AND KILL BUSINESS\u2019\n\nResidents who spoke with TheCable attributed the unchecked rate of activities promoting soot in Rivers to the collusion between security and government agencies with those involved in the \u201cbusiness\u201d \u2014 a claim that was also established in the 2019 report.\n\nOguchi said in spite of the environmental hazards caused by oil companies in the area, they are heavily guarded by security operatives that often clampdown on youths who try to protest.\n\n\u201cThe government, regulatory and security agencies are all in this together with the multinational companies; they\u2019re the direct beneficiaries of whatever is going on. It\u2019s a kill and divide business that they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.\n\nSylvester, another resident in Egbema, said: \u201cThe beneficiaries are making fortune out of the situation and leaving the poor to die more. The soot is killing us slowly.\u201d\n\nEugene Abels, leader of the #StopTheSoot campaign in the state, said the scourge has demonstrated the failure of the state and federal governments.\n\n\u201cAll tiers of government and regulators have shown negligence of duty and responsibility to the oaths which they swore to upheld and protect the lives, fauna and flora of the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to TheCable\u2019s findings, Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, said the ministry \u201cis not relenting on efforts to curb oil spillage, gas flaring and dangerous work of artisanal refiners\u201d.\n\nShe, however, did not respond to enquiries on measures put in place to punish oil companies and individuals responsible for activities causing soot in Rivers.\n\nWhen contacted, Idris Musa, director-general of NOSDRA, confirmed TheCable\u2019s findings that oil companies still flare indiscriminately and that illegal oil bunkers and artisanal refiners are operating unchecked in Rivers.\n\n\u201cAll those places you mentioned, I know very them well and I can tell you in terms of oil spill, gas flare and artisanal refining, they\u2019re common there and the waterways there are polluted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEbocha Oil Centre is one of the areas where gas is still being flared because there is a flow station there. We also have the Brass terminal and others there. In Finima where you have the NLNG, there is Bonny oil and gas export terminal and others.\u201d\n\nMusa said the agency is regulating the oil companies against flaring of gas through various measures, adding that \u201cthose who cross the red line in the past have been sanctioned\u201d.\n\nThe NOSDRA DG said the agency is working with the Nigerian Navy to tackle illegal oil bunkering and artisanal refining, adding that efforts are ongoing to fish out those who aid the criminal activities.\n\nOn his part, Paul Osu, DPR\u2019s head of public affairs, said the agency has several initiatives in place to tackle gas flaring but he did not address TheCable\u2019s questions on penalties meted to oil companies found wanting.\n\nTheCable could not get the reaction of the state ministry of environment on the matter. But when contacted, Princewill Chike, the commissioner for health, declined comment.\n\nNnamdi Omoni, the state police command\u2019s spokesman, also declined comment on alleged collaboration between security operatives and illegal oil bunkers and artisanal refiners.\n\nThis is a special investigative project by Cable Newspaper Journalism Foundation (CNJF) in partnership with TheCable, supported by the MacArthur Foundation.

          "text": "Nmesoma Esther and her siblings were lost in their world as they roamed their three-bedroom flat. With little to worry about, they giggled at intervals and bounced around with reckless abandon. Esther was happy to enjoy the evening hours before having to face a familiar demon at night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe nine-year-old girl suffers respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) \u2014 a breathing disorder among children which causes insufficient surfactant in the lungs.\n\nEvery night, Esther endures pain and discomfort due to her inability to breathe well. But her hope of overcoming the condition is continually dampened by the relentless activities of the artisanal refiners who operate behind her house every day.\n\nIn 2017, her family relocated to Ohanachiom street, Obigbo west in Oyigbo LGA of Rivers. Since their arrival at the new environment renowned for heavy pollution, her condition has worsened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy chest used to be heavy whenever I try to breathe. I don\u2019t also sleep well at night because I don\u2019t breathe well,\u201d she said, wearing a defeated look.\n\nDaily, Esther watches as soot filters through the windows and falls on the ceiling fans, curtains, TV, chairs, and furniture. Nothing in the house is spared.\n\nEsther\u2019s situation depicts a state of helplessness. But she\u2019s not alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAririguzo Chidiebere(pictured), another resident of Ovim-street in Oyigbo LGA, could not hide his frustration.\n\n\u201cThe soot issue has been a hell of an experience for us. We\u2019re prone to catarrh always and we sneeze a lot. Most times, when you blow your nose, you\u2019ll notice everything is black,\u201d he said.\n\nSOOT, THE SLOW KILLER\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoot is the common term for a type of particle pollution called PM 2.5 \u2014 particulate matter with diameters that are 2.5 micrometers or less.\n\nIt is mostly formed as a result of the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, and due to its tiny size, it can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream easily.\n\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), soot is one of the deadliest forms of air pollution.\n\nPrecious Ede, a climate scientist and air pollution specialist at Rivers State University (RSU), said soot contains harmful chemical substances that can cause cancer and respiratory disorders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe harmful substances, the professor said, are heavy metals, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), polyclinic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), diesel fuels, mineral oils, benzene, toluene and xylenes.\n\nIn spite of its deadly nature, residents of Rivers have continued to grapple with it.\n\nFollowing the outrage that trailed its prevalence in 2016, Nyesom Wike, the state governor, had commissioned a technical team in 2018 to investigate the factors causing soot pollution and how to tackle it.\n\nAccording to the report published in 2019, a copy of which was obtained by TheCable, illegal bunkering and gas flaring topped the list of activities causing soot pollution in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report \u2014 citing a review of hospital records across the 23 LGAs in Rivers \u2014 also revealed that 22,077 persons who received treatment for soot-related conditions between 2014 and 2018 suffered respiratory ailments.\n\nEde, who led the technical team, told the TheCable that findings showed there was \u201c30% increase in morbidity and mortality rates in Rivers state 16 months after the soot incident started in 2016\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe concluded that the soot is a source of the very harmful condition that is already killing people. We also looked at the results of laboratory analysis and projected possible rate of cancer occurrence among residents of Port Harcourt,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd we were able to come up with information showing that thousands of people will come down with cancer annually as a result of soot.\u201d\n\nHarmful chemical composition of \u2018black soot\u2019 and effects on human health\n\nPollutants Health effects on residents 1. Arsenic Headaches, drowsiness, seizures, brain damage, diarrhea, low blood pressure, muscular problems, heart problem and intestinal bleeding. 2. Lead Brain damage, mental retardation, anemia, depression, insomnia and respiratory distress 3. Mercury Respiratory problems (asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, etc.) and neurological problems such as loss of memory, mental confusion and lack of concentration. 4. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), e.g., benzene, xylenes, mineral oils, diesel fuels \u2026 Decreased immune system, breathing problems, severe kidney and liver damage and mental problems. 5. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), e.g., naphthalene, fluorene, anthracene, phenanthrene, etc. Breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis), jaundice, cancer, catarrh, kidney and liver damage, breathing problems and body stress.\n\nSource: Laboratory analysis of chemical characterisation of soot (Rivers state government\u2019s 2019 report) and interviews with experts.\n\nAirVisual\u2019s ranking of air quality in Port Harcourt between June and July 2021 showed that it is mostly unhealthy for the residents. On July 9, for instance, an air index of 152 was recorded for the city \u2014 far above the standard(0-50) and moderate(51-100) levels.\n\nAccording to Ede, people like the nine-year-old Esther with pre-existing conditions are more likely to suffer serious health challenges due to the poor air quality in Port Harcourt and other parts of the state.\n\n\u2018DEPRESSED LUNG FUNCTION ACTIVITIES\u2019\n\nTo ascertain the effect of soot on residents, TheCable facilitated lung function tests and chest x-ray for 10 people living in areas where the scourge is prevalent.\n\nBased on the direction of medical experts, and to obtain reliable results, residents selected for the tests were neither smokers nor did they have any known pre-existing health issue.\n\nThe lung function test was carried out at the department of human physiology laboratory, college of health sciences, University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT) while the chest x-ray was conducted at Splendour Diagnostic Centre \u2014 both in Obio/Akpor LGA.\n\nThe participants selected for both tests were within the age range of 22 and 33, and drawn from Port Harcourt, Oyigbo, Obio/Akpor and Ikwere LGAs.\n\nFor the lung function test, the parameters used include forced vital capacity (FVC) \u2014 the amount of air that can be forcibly given out from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible; and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) \u2014 the amount of air that can be expelled forcefully in one second.\n\nOthers are peak expiratory volume (PEF), which is the highest amount of expelled air; and FEV1/FVC, the ratio of the amount of air that can be expelled forcefully in one second to the total amount of air expelled.\n\nThe chest x-ray examined the heart size and contour, the lung fields, and the aorta, which is the main artery of the body supplying oxygenated blood to the circulatory system.\n\nThe bony rib cage and pleural effusion \u2014 abnormal, excessive collection of fluid next to the lung \u2014 were also examined.\n\nResults of the lung function test showed that none of the participants used \u2014 two females and three males \u2014 had standard lung function activities.\n\nOnly two of the respondents (40%) had \u201cfairly okay\u201d lung function activities while the remaining three (60%) had \u201cbetween depressed to seriously depressed lung function activities\u201d.\n\nGwotmut Dajen, chief medical laboratory scientist at UNIPORT\u2019s physiology department, said \u201cthe results fell short of standards expected of both male and female\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fact that on the overall, we don\u2019t have an up to standard subject among the five of them is an indication that there\u2019s a general depression of lungs function activities in these subjects,\u201d he said.\n\nDajen said the implication of the result is that the oxygen intake of the individuals is limited, which portends danger to their health.\n\n\u201cEnvironment, of which soot is one, is a major factor responsible for this,\u201d he added.\n\nKodu Baribe, a student of RSU who was one of the persons tested, wasn\u2019t shocked to discover that she has \u201cseriously depressed lungs activities\u201d. Baribe says she knows that the inhalation of soot must have taken a toll on her and others in Elele, Obio/Akpo where she resides.\n\n\u201cI am really not shocked. We know that the soot is a problem but nothing has been done about it. Sometimes, I notice the difficulty in breathing and chest pain from the accumulated dirt that comes from the air,\u201d she said.\n\nTheCable\u2019s findings corroborate a 2021 study, which examined the ambient air of Port Harcourt, and revealed there is \u201ca high probability of accumulation and toxicity in human tissues and health\u201d due to the poor air quality in the city.\n\nCHEST X-RAY SHOWED NO IMMEDIATE ADVERSE EFFECTS\n\nThe chest x-ray results of the participants showed that majority of them are relatively okay, as there were no issues with the sampled parameters among the individuals.\n\nBest Ordinoha, a professor of community medicine and environmental health at UNIPORT, explained that even though the chest x-ray results showed that the participants were normal, it does not mean they are not affected by soot.\n\nHe said the effect of the soot is based on the \u201cdefensive mechanisms\u201d of each person.\n\nOrdinoha, who is also a health consultant at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH), added that the effect of soot can be immediate or delayed.\n\n\u201cThe immediate effects will include hypersensitivity reactions like asthmatic attacks and sneezing,\u201d he said.\n\nOrdinoha said some of the delayed effects in adults include increased risk of lung cancer and bronchitis while children are at the risk of having pneumonia.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, it takes a longer time for some of these adverse effects to manifest. So, basically, people will still feel the adverse effect but their body and lungs may appear okay because the vast quantity has been filtered out by those defensive mechanisms,\u201d he said.\n\nOrji Sunday, a former resident of Port Harcourt, told TheCable that soot pollution informed his decision to relocate from the city in November 2020.\n\n\u201cI left Port Harcourt because of the soot issue. It was prevalent around First Artillery axis of the state where I was living at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nBut unlike Sunday, many who have nowhere to go have resigned to fate, huffing and puffing while hanging on to the hope of a clean environment devoid of soot.\n\nGAS FLARING, BUNKERING BOOMING \u2014 BUT WHERE ARE THE REGULATORS?\n\nWhen Lukeson Oguchi returned to Mgbede community in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni LGA after his master\u2019s degree abroad, he was saddened by widespread pollution in the area.\n\nAlthough the 2019 study by the state government revealed that \u201ceradication of the soot depends on the reduction or complete extermination of the identified factors causing soot\u201d, TheCable found that not much has been done to stop the causal factors.\n\nIn several parts of Rivers, illegal bunkering and artisanal refining are lucrative businesses while those involved are mostly unchallenged by relevant authorities.\n\nAccording to Oguchi, the ease at which people carry out the illegal activities and the attendant profit remain a motivating factor for many residents.\n\n\u201cThey (illegal oil bunkers and artisanal refiners) make a lot of money daily and in my place, it\u2019s gradually becoming a business that every young boy and young girl wants to get involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere, if you invest N13,000 you will make up to 15,000 and 20,000 daily. Those who invest N2 million get up to N500,000 daily.\u201d\n\nThe negligence of security and regulatory agencies in addressing the situation was obvious during visits to Aggah and Okwuzi in Egbema; Rumuokparali waterside in Obio/Akpo; and Obigbo west in Oyigbo LGA.\n\nTheCable also found that products \u2014 such as kerosene, petroleum and diesel \u2014 from these illegal activities are openly displayed for sale in markets and within residential areas.\n\nJust like illegal bunkering, oil companies still openly flare gas at the detriment of their host communities.\n\nEbocha community in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni LGA, for instance, hosts the Ebocha Oil Centre owned by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited (NAOC).\n\nResidents said the company\u2019s operations have become a nightmare for them due to constant flaring of gas and oil spillages.\n\nAccording to Stanley Anyaladu, chairman of Egbema community development committee, the area has continued to suffer \u201cmassive pollution\u201d since Agip discovered oil in commercial quantity.\n\n\u201cThere has been massive pollution of our area since 1965 when Agip discovered oil in commercial quantity in Ebocha.

Our water has been polluted while we inhale soot and other harmful substances on daily basis due to gas flaring,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Finima, Bonny LGA of the state, there is also constant flaring of gas by the Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) and other companies.\n\nWarialabo Amoni Hart, chairman of Finima Environmental Protection Initiative (FEPI), said the government has turned a \u201cblind eye\u201d to the situation in the area which he claims has continued to kill people.\n\n\u201cIn Finima, there\u2019s high casualties of respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and health complications because of the soot from heavy gas flare.

          "title": "This app wants to simplify Twitter giveaways, without bank accounts",
          "text": "Let\u2019s say I wanted to send a surprise \u2018happy birthday\u2019 cash gift to a friend; my first thought would be to ask for their bank account number. I would do this for people I know very well but also for someone I only know on social media.\n\nBut what if my virtual friend, feeling we are not buddies as such or having been scarred by online money doubling scams, hesitates to share such personal information? Can I thrill them on their special day by using public information I have about them?\n\nSometime in June, I tried Vendly, a web app that is trialling a solution for this need (or desire, if you\u2019re not yet persuaded). \u2018Payments made Social\u2019 the landing page declares on a light green background. Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband.

Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Google\u2019s interest in Africa\u2019s tech talent pool deepens, the tech giant has partnered with Nigerian-founded game development studio, Maliyo Games, to open applications for a mobile game developer training program. Called GameUp Bootcamp, the program is available to interested individuals in Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria.\n\nThe applications, which opened on Monday, July 19, 2021 \u2014 and closes by August 2 \u2014 will offer developers planning to build a career in game development access to mentorship and relevant tools. Selected applicants will go through a virtual training program from August 16 to December 23, 2021, where they will learn to refine, package, and develop Android games.\n\nBeing a project-based learning program, by the end of the training period, successful participants will be evaluated based on the completion of the curriculum and ability to publish a game on the Google Play Store successfully.\n\nParticipants will pass through three levels of training, themed: Game Development Fundamentals, Succeed on the Play Store, and Publish Your First Game. The successful completion of one level validates moving to the next level.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEligibility\n\nIntending applicants must:\n\nReside in Nigeria, Ghana, or Kenya\n\nHave a basic background in programming languages like C#, C++, and PHP.\n\nOwn a PC.\n\nBe available to commence Bootcamp by August 16, 2021\n\nNote: Selected participants will be judged based on three metrics: competence, commitment, and creativity.\n\nApplication process\n\nApplicants will pass through two stages before final shortlisting.\n\nStage one: Fill the online application form on the company website.\n\nStage two: After scaling the first stage, shortlisted candidates will have to undergo a C# (a core language for game developers) assessment to demonstrate their competence in the programming language. The assessment is scheduled to hold on August 9, 2021.\n\nNote: The organisers will provide data allowance for selected developers during the training.\n\nAbout GameUp Bootcamp\n\nThe GameUp Bootcamp is an adaptation of an existing training project by Maliyo Games, which was instituted in 2020. It is a curriculum-based training program that prospective hires must go through before they are accepted into the company.\n\nBetween 2020 and now, the company has trained seven people and absorbed one into the company. Interestingly, the program was born out of the need to solve the problem of talent acquisition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe actually launched this program because, as a game development studio, we are constantly looking for talented individuals to join our team. And because of a lack of structured education system that produces competent game developers in Nigeria, we made the decision last year to launch an in-house program that will enable us to train individuals who are interested in becoming game developers.\u201d That\u2019s Hugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHugo Obi, Founder, Maliyo Games. Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2012, the company has grown to become one of Nigeria\u2019s longest-standing Android game development studios. According to the founder, this is one of the qualities that attracted Google to the project, aside from the fact that Maliyo Games has published some Africa-themed games on the Google Play Store.\n\nNotable mentions include Aboki Run (similar to Temple Run), Whot King, and Jungle escape. Others like Danfo Racing are still in development.\n\nEven though the company\u2019s initial intention for the curriculum is limited to the Nigerian market, Google\u2019s partnership increased the scope to reach multiple locations, thereby raising the number of selected applicants to 500. In addition to that, Google will also provide support for app store success, which includes successful publishing of content on Google Play Store.\n\nAnother way this program will help beginner game developers is by providing them with a pool of mentors. Going by the number of admitted candidates, mentorship will not only come from Maliyo Games team, but the company will also crowdsource mentors from the international gaming ecosystem.\n\nExperienced mentors can volunteer through this link.\n\nMaliyo Games\u2019 fit\n\nAs is typical of content from many indigenous companies, Maliyo Games studio ensures that its content reflects the African scene.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t do the generic stuff, like working for third parties and designing based on their requirements or being part of a production team where we only look after one aspect of e development. For us, it has always been about African-inspired. And this is what stands us out in the gaming community,\u201d the founder explains.\n\nFor Obi, the ultimate goal of the GameUp Bootcamp \u2014 which could become a yearly affair \u2014 is to upskill people and have more game developers in the African gaming ecosystem. In addition to that, to increase the number of African-published content on the Google Play Store, and help to identify and attract talents into the company as it plans to grow its team.\n\nIn achieving the former, Obi reveals that top candidates from the Bootcamp will be linked with other studios across the continent. Already, there are existing internal partnerships with studios in Kenya, Ghana, and Senegal.\n\nAside from that, Maliyo Games is part of the Africa Game Developer Community, where it networks with gaming studios in South Africa, Uganda, Cameroon, and Ethiopia. Eventually, Obi believes that the Bootcamp will become a talent pipeline for these studios.\n\nMeanwhile, game studios looking to hire developers through the program can show their interest here.\n\nAfrica\u2019s gaming industry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth of the African gaming industry has been gaining momentum for the past three years with growing broadband and smartphone penetration. In fact, prospects are increasing despite the pandemic.\n\nObi likens games to music and movies, not only as a form of escape, but also entertainment which is universally accepted without discrimination of the source.\n\nHe identifies three major challenges that may have stalled the growth of the country\u2019s gaming industry in the past decade: talent, distribution, and monetisation.\n\nIn his opinion, in the past 9 years of running Maliyo Games, opportunities that exist now are thinning out the effects of these challenges. For instance, global distribution channels now exist \u2014 the likes of app stores \u2014 supporting reach and marketing, and payment solutions abound.\n\nWith this, creators can focus on developing and releasing content. If anything, local content are assured of global consumption. Obi\u2019s dream is that by the end of 2022, a product of the Bootcamp would become a highly grossed game on the Google Play Store.\n\nWith projects like this, Africa\u2019s gaming community is, perhaps, on its way to becoming a major contributor to the over $121.1 billion global mobile gaming industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Well, its website is live now. Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, revealed this in a tweet yesterday.\n\nWhat\u2019s the fuss about? Since the 90s, when the first tech companies were founded, Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem has progressed. Since then, we\u2019ve seen Paystack get acquired, Interswitch and Flutterwave become unicorns, and Jumia get listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese are supposed to be exciting times, but it appears government policies are making it difficult for entrepreneurs and investors to remain excited. This year alone, the transacting of cryptocurrency through banks has been regulated, while Twitter has been temporarily banned in the country.\n\nEvents like this have made it important for founders to interact with the government, hence, the Startup Bill. At the time of the first report, it was revealed that a first draft of the bill would be ready by August 2021.\n\nWith the website launching only 11 days to the end of July, it could be that plans are on track.\n\nAccording to a Medium post on the website, the first draft of the bill would be reviewed by ecosystem leaders and representatives in July, while town halls would be held in August 2021. A final draft would be produced in September 2021 and submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari in October 2021.\n\nCause for optimism? Should plans for the bill go as planned, it could unlock a lot of value for Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem. For one, investors are assured that sudden government policies would not destroy their investments. More capital being injected into the tech ecosystem would also mean more jobs, and who can complain about that?\n\nAs usual, we\u2019ll keep you informed of any new developments.\n\nKenyans to pay VAT for using Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<em>Photo Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-mbabazi-001a331a/\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d rel=\u201dnoopener\u201d>Morgan Mbabazi</a> (National Media Group).</em>\n\nStarting August 2021, Kenyans will begin paying Value Added Tax (VAT) for using video conferencing platform, Zoom. The company joins the ranks of YouTube and Facebook as Internet platforms charging VAT in the country.\n\nWho is this for? Not everyone. Customers will be issued a VAT invoice showing the tax at the appropriate rate if they are not registered for VAT in Kenya. For registered VAT customers, they must provide Zoom with their Personal Identification Number (PIN) and a declaration that they are registered for VAT in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a customer\u2019s \u2018sold to\u2019 location indicates Kenya, but they have not provided a valid PIN and the required declaration, Zoom will charge Kenyan VAT on the invoice.\n\nThis development is not surprising. To increase revenue, the Kenyan government has revealed plans to tax companies that generate profit from the country.\n\nChanging times. Across the world, attempts by governments to tax digital businesses have increased. However, it is not straightforward as they operate models that are not catered to by most taxation laws.\n\nAs we revealed in a previous article, the existing agreement under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stipulates that companies pay taxes where their goods/services are produced instead of where they are consumed.\n\nThat has not stopped governments from trying, and the Kenyan government has led the way on the African continent. These are still early days, but it seems companies are getting on board quickly, and it might be a matter of time before other African countries follow suit.\n\nWhat do you think? Share your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nZimbabwe to include VASPs as securities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@ewankennedy19?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Ewan Kennedy</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-trading?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has revealed its intention to widen the definition of securities to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).\n\nVASPs refer to entities that facilitate the transaction, safekeeping, and administration of digital currencies. Consequently, cryptocurrency exchanges in Zimbabwe would now be regulated under the amended Securities and Exchange Act.\n\nThis move, which is the first time digital assets are mentioned under Zimbabwean law, suggests that the government is open to cryptocurrencies as stores of value and could facilitate their adoption in the South African country.\n\nBecause of attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies by governments, a common debate has been that of their status as securities. Classifying them as securities would mean that governments would regulate their usage, something that proponents say goes against the nature of cryptocurrencies.\n\nBy the way, seeing you love reading our newsletter this much, invite your friends and family to join you.

In the years following independence, Nigeria was the world\u2019s largest palm oil producer with a whopping 43% market share.\n\nThe story is different today as the country is the fifth-largest palm oil producer, but with only 2% of world production, it is far from a major player in the industry.\n\nAccording to Bernard Okata, a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, the annual demand for oil palm in Nigeria stands at 3 million metric tonnes. However, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, the country only produces 1.02 million metric tonnes.\n\nSuch a considerable gap means that Nigeria has to supplement local demand using imports. And as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, revealed, the country spends about $500 million annually to meet this demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVarious reports suggest that a lack of funding is responsible for Nigeria\u2019s loss of dominance in the oil palm industry, but that may not be entirely true. In 1965, several countries in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America received nearly $2 billion from the World Bank for the oil palm industry.\n\nNigeria was the second-highest recipient of this funding with $451.5 million. Furthermore, between 1975 and 2009, it was the second-largest recipient of funding from the World Bank. Therefore, it seems funding was not the major reason for the drop in production.\n\nIt is in this market that agritech startup, Releaf, is looking to make its mark. Founded in 2017 by Ikenna Nzewi (Co-founder and CEO), Isaiah Udotong (Co-founder and Chief Growth Officer), and Uzoma Ayogu (Co-founder and CTO), the startup briefly functioned as a marketplace connecting buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities.\n\nWhile doing this, the founders realised that food factories could not get enough high-quality raw materials to operate their factories at maximum capacity. They typically have fixed production costs, and the inability to run at optimal levels would mean they pass these costs down to the final consumer.\n\nHaving learnt their lessons from leading with solutions, the founders set about understanding the market before making a move. They spent some time interacting with farmers and understanding how the market works. Armed with this knowledge, they changed their focus from a marketplace to an agro-processor producing palm kernel oil (PKO).\n\nPKO \u2014 extracted from the palm seed or kernel \u2014 is often used in food processing industries and cosmetics manufacturing. And according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), it is responsible for about 45% of the fat intake in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, getting quality PKO is difficult, and most factories depend on smallholder farmers responsible for about 80% of the industry\u2019s output. Others rely on importation to meet their needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith little financial assistance, these farmers have to crack the kernels manually, wasting precious person-hours that could be spent producing palm oil.\n\nThis is where Releaf plays. They buy the palm nuts and process them into PKO \u2014 using Kraken, a machine they created \u2014 before selling to factories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKraken. Image Source: Supplied\n\nEmployers of labour in Nigeria often complain about the unemployability of Nigerian youth. Still, Nzewi reveals that while it was a bit difficult, they got capable hands who assisted in the development of Kraken.\n\nIt also helped that Ayogu has a mechanical engineering degree from Duke University and previously worked at General Electric.\n\nEmpowering smallholder farmers\n\nSmallholder farmers currently drive the startup\u2019s supply, and Nzewi reveals that they are trying to reorient their mindset from what he calls a margin mentality to a volume mentality.\n\n\u201cA margin mentality is, \u2018okay, I have one ton of these palm kernels, how can I make 10,000 profit off it?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to make as much profit off whatever I have. That\u2019s the mentality I have. A volume mentality is, \u2018how can I work with the partners so I can produce 10 tons of this a week instead of the one tonne I\u2019m currently doing?'\u201d\n\nThis is done through various means, including financing and educating the farmers. With more money and knowledge of agricultural best practices, they can improve their production capacity.\n\nNzewi reveals that there are farmers in their network whose incomes have increased 5x since they started working with them.\n\nIn June 2021, the startup revealed a partnership with OnePipe to enable farmers to access digital financial services. The startup says that over 60% of the beneficiaries are women, with a 100% repayment rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm kernel mill. Image source: Supplied\n\nThis is significant because women constitute 75% of the workforce in the agricultural sector but do not earn enough and can often lose their land when their husbands or male relatives die.\n\nIt is common for agritech startups that work with smallholder farmers to have an extensive network of farmers, but this is not the route Releaf has chosen. Instead, they are focused on increasing the production capacities of the 3,000 farmers in their network.\n\nAccording to Nzewi, \u201cYou might not see that we have 100,000 farmers that we\u2019re working with in the first year, but you will see that many of our farmers are tripling, quadrupling or 5xing their income, and that\u2019s where our focus is. We\u2019re focusing on rural industrialisation, and we understand that takes concerted effort rather than just giving everyone a t-shirt or giving everyone a form to fill or something.\u201d\n\nDecentralising food production\n\nMost food factories in Nigeria are located in big cities such as Lagos, Kaduna, and Ibadan, but Releaf has taken a different approach.\n\nTheir factory is located in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. As it turns out, the South-South of Nigeria is responsible for 42% of Nigeria\u2019s palm oil production.\n\nOn what the startup\u2019s vision for food processing in Africa is, Nzewi says, \u201cMany people have tried to take Western models and fit them into Nigeria because they see a country with many people. The same thing has been done to the food processing industry, so most food processing factories are set up in big cities like Ibadan, Kaduna, or Lagos.\n\n\u201cThey are big factories with large capacity, but when you go into those factories, you will see that they are using about 30% of the capacity, and that is generally driven by the fact that they cannot get access to high-quality raw material.\u201d\n\nNzewi points out that while food factories in the West often have the luxury of sourcing raw materials from large farms, the same method can\u2019t be applied in Africa. By building factories in these big cities, they have to source their raw materials from distant farmers, which increases their production costs.\n\nConsequently, they can\u2019t pay farmers well. However, by locating factories close to these farmers, Releaf can help them increase their productivity and pay them more than the bigger factories.\n\nPalm trees grow in other parts of Africa, and Nzewi revealed expansion plans in the works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just trying to colour the African map with a presence in different countries, but we\u2019re more focused on deep impact. That\u2019s why I talk about things like the volume mentality and increasing the income of one of our smallholders 5x because that\u2019s the type of impact you should expect to see with Releaf,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalm trees. Image Source: Iwaria\n\nStanding out from the crowd\n\nWhile PKO production is not foreign to Nigeria, Releaf\u2019s technology and scale set it apart. The startup reveals that it can produce 500 tonnes of PKO every week. In addition, Kraken can crack palm kernel nuts with a 95% efficiency, ensuring little wastage.\n\nWith smallholder farmers as their major competitors, its network of 3,000 farmers supplying them with the necessary raw materials gives Releaf a huge advantage.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nHaving created their proprietary technology, I was curious to know if that could change the startup\u2019s focus, but that does not seem to be the case. Releaf plans to build a network of decentralised factories powered by its technology close to farming hotspots on the continent.\n\nHowever, they revealed a willingness to adjust their approach as long as it ties in with their overarching mission to empower farmers and factories.\n\nSixty per cent of the world\u2019s uncultivated land lies in Africa, and experts believe that with the aid of technology and adequate help from research institutions, the continent can feed the world.\n\nWith the help of Kraken, Releaf is gunning for a portion of the global $61 billion palm oil market.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "US forces, including the navy\u2019s SEAL Team 6, almost committed an unauthorized incursion into Nigerian territory \u2013 also commonly referred to as an invasion \u2013 last year while undertaking a mission to free a 27-year-old American kidnapped by a local militant group, a new and explosive book from two Washington Post reporters claims.\n\nIn \u201cI Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump\u2019s Catastrophic Final Year\u201d by authors Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, a chaotic scene is described as unfolding when US special forces descended upon the country in an effort to rescue Philip Walton, the son of an American missionary, who had been kidnapped at his home by armed gunmen in neighboring Niger.\n\nAccording to Leonnig and Rucker, US operators had to halt their mission while en route after learning that a White House aide, Kash Patel, had been mistaken in his assertion that Nigeria\u2019s government had given the OK or even been warned about the impending US incursion to rescue the young man, who was being held in a remote compound in the country\u2019s north.\n\nRead Also: President Trump hails US Forces over rescue of American hostage\n\nAccording to UK\u2019s Independent newspaper, the operation resumed after permission was obtained from Nigeria\u2019s government, but the revelation underscored how close the US came to making an unauthorized strike against militants in a foreign country.\n\nPatel, according to the book, was not in a role where it was his job to get in contact with foreign governments to notify them of operations in their territory, but according to the book such processes had broken down in the final months of former President Donald Trump\u2019s term in office.\n\nTrump gave approval for the military action while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was overseas, national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien was out of town, and Defence Secretary Mark Esper had yet to discuss the matter with the president, the book claims. In the ensuing confusion, Patel reportedly \u201cassured\u201d senior officials involved in the process that Nigeria\u2019s government had been notified.\n\n\u201cThe mission had to be paused until the Nigerian government signed off. American forces had come very close to a technical invasion of a foreign country,\u201d wrote the authors.\n\nI Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump\u2019s Catastrophic Final Year was released on July 20, published by Bloomsbury.\n\nPatel declined to discuss the events of Halloween when contacted by the book\u2019s authors. The 31 Oct. mission was successful, leading to the deaths of numerous militants, according to the book, while Walton\u2019s rescue was reported by news outlets last year.\n\n\u201cBig win for our very elite U.S. Special Forces today,\u201d Trump tweeted at the time of Walton\u2019s rescue last year.\n\n\u201cLast night, our Country\u2019s brave warriors rescued an American hostage in Nigeria.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe eminent African novelist and critic, revered Chinua Achebe of blessed memories in his famous book titled: \u201d The Trouble With Nigeria\u201d summarized the country\u2019s problem to be \u201csimply a failure of leadership\u2026. the Nigerian\u2019s problem is the unwillingness or the inability of its leaders to rise to the responsibility, to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership\u201d. Achebe also challenged our (citizens) resignation and inspire us to reject stone age habit which inhibit our dear country from becoming a \u201cmodern and attractive country.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian media space has been awash with Electoral Act amendment which the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had in its report suggested that electronic transmission be employed by INEC where practicable, as contained in section 52(3) of the bill.\n\nHowever, according to reports, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC, Niger North) moved that INEC should only consider electronic transmission if the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly. Abdullahi\u2019s motion was seconded by Senator Ali Ndume (APC, Borno South). But some senators notably those of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) disagreed, throwing the Senate into a rowdy session.\n\nIn reaction, the senate minority leader, Enyinnanya Abaribe (PDP, Abia South) then called for public voting. According to Abaribe, the process would allow Nigerians to know who is voting for what. The Senators proceeded to publicly vote but they were visibly divided along party lines.\n\nOur situation as a nation can only get better if we get leadership right. How can we get leadership right if the electoral process that produce our leaders is mired with irregularities as a result of the inefficient manual system? It is a truism that analogue system does not serve any institution well in the 21st century hence INEC in it\u2019s electoral reform bill sought to digitize the electoral process to minimize the jaggedness that comes with the manual system.\n\nWhile many Nigerians saw it as a welcome development and progress long overdue, the National Assembly was plunged into disarray over whether there should be electronic transmission of election results. In the end the National Assembly was polarized along party lines with APC pugnaciously towing the path of reversing to the antiquity of manual election. Their excuse is that there\u2019s limited broadband penetration across the country. But we still have two years to invest in the electronic infrastructures that can give us a free, fair and transparent elections.\n\nRecall also that ballot snatching has been a worrisome phenomenon to electoral process in Nigeria for as long election itself. President Muhammadu Buhari perplexed about the recurrent decimal of ballot snatching during elections, ordered extra judicial killing of ballot box snatchers in the build up to 2019 election. Now that INEC has come up with electronic transmission of results that will eliminate ballot box snatching, APC law makers and the president himself are dilly-dallying about it.\n\nThough one wonders why the president himself has three times declined to assent the electoral reform bill which among others will render ballot box snatchers incapacitated to a very great extent. It\u2019s the President\u2019s procrastination that has lingered the bill at the National Assembly uptill date. The body language of APC leaders across board on the electoral reform bill has raised a lot of conspiracy theories that the party is anxious it will loose 2023 elections should the elections be free, fair and transparent in the manner the bill presents.\n\nBut, regardless of what\u2019s actually happening behind the scenes, one thing is clear. The Independence of INEC is threatened as it is now been subjected to seek approval from National Communication Commission (NCC) or the National Assembly before transmitting election results electronically. This becomes a matter of grave concern as the hope of a credible elections lies in the independence of the unbiased electoral umpire.\n\nThe sixteen years of PDP rule did not fulfil the aspirations and yearnings of the Nigerian masses hence they fell for the change mantra of APC and consequently the party won the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections. But it is rather paradoxical that the party which promised Nigerians change is in practice, curiosily averse to progressive change.\n\nThe six years of APC rule so far has left so much to be desired. Economic hardship and insecurity which the party promised to fix have worsened but the party and president Mohammadu Buhari can be judged kindly by posterity just like Goodluck Jonathan if they give INEC and Nigerians a free, fair and transparent elections by allowing INEC exercise it\u2019s duties without external control, the way it should be.\n\nIn the memorable phrase of President Abraham Lincoln, democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Let the people get the government they want in a free, fair and transparent elections as enshrined in our constitution.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving Corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\n...",

He told me that Igboho was tightly chained to the floor and he is in serious pains.\n\n\u201cWhile I was talking to the source by telephone, I can hear our client crying and asking that the chains be removed and that he is in pains. But I can hear one officer telling him that they cannot remove the chains as they are acting on instruction.\n\nAlliyu, however, said that the extradition order being sought by the Nigerian authorities may not likely sail through, given the status of Igboho as a political offender.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI know that our client, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho Oosa), would be taken to a court in Cotonou, the capital of the Republic of Benin, tomorrow [today].\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities and security operatives that arrested him would be approaching the court for an extradition order to bring Sunday Igboho back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut it is not likely that the extradition order being sought for would sail through. This is because of the status of our client as a political offender who enjoys immunity against extradition. Like I said in a press release earlier today, even his arrest by security operatives was against the political nature of his offence.\n\n\u201cThere is an existing ex- tradition treaty between four West African countries of Nigeria, Togo, Ghana and Benin Republic, which grants Igboho immunity from being extradited from the Republic of Benin.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/ or undue delay in prosecution, the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\n\u201cArticle 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries,\u201d he said.",

So, they have given us a total number of 100 cows and 50 goats.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge intervention considering the economic hardship experienced in the state due to insurgency. This has shown that Muslim groups in Malaysia are identifying with us. It has brought huge relief to both state government and displaced persons as well as widows and orphans.\n\n\u201cYou can see how the children are jubilating because their parents can\u2019t provide.

The Court of Appeal of Nigeria and the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese judgement debts are compiled at the office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice.\n\n\u201cAppropriations have been made from 2015-2021 by the National Assembly of Nigeria to settle and pay these debts including, issuing of promissory notes to beneficiaries, but the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice has repeatedly stated that monies meant for the payment of judgement debts owed by the federal government of Nigeria, was not released by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis to us, is apparently unconstitutional for the executive arm of government to continue in neglecting judgements of the judicial arm of government, especially superior courts of records vested with the powers to adjudicate between individuals, organisations and all arms of government as stated in Section 6(1) of the 1999 constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, using the mass media as empowered by Section 22 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to cry out for justice over the non-payment of the judgement debts by the federal government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe urge the president to rise to the occasion and as a matter of urgent national importance, consider the common man, the citizens of Nigeria whose businesses and assets continue to diminish by the non-payment of judgement debts owed since 2015 and the impact of COVID-19 to our economy. Mr President please save our soul. As they say justice delayed is justice denied.\u201d",

          "text": "The best definition of kindness is not one provided by any of the world\u2019s best dictionaries but one demonstrated by how we treat others on a daily basis. Kindness is a universal language that does not require any special knowledge, exposure, skills, training or background to understand and appreciate it as a beneficiary or observer of a kind act. Neither is any special knowledge or training required to show and extend it to others. Just as anyone and everyone can be shown acts of kindness, all persons without exception can and ought to show and extend acts of kindness to others. Kindness flows from deep within us, from the better angels of our nature. Hence, the common idiom \u201cthe milk of human kindness\u201d.\n\nThis is probably the backdrop to the theme \u201cKindness\u2026a Way of Life\u201d, which FirstBank has chosen for commemoration of its 2021 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Week (CR&S Week). This year\u2019s CR&S Week, scheduled to hold from 26th \u2013 30th July 2021, will feature Kind Comments Days, visits to orphanages/less privilege homes, webinars focused on the kindness theme, SPARK school engagement among other activities \u2013 lined up for each of the days. The yearly CR&S Week is a dedicated week designed to offer FirstBank staff, customers and the public opportunities to demonstrate the milk of human kindness that flows in them and give their time and resources to defined causes. It seeks to amplify FirstBank\u2019s innate culture of giving and volunteering as embodied in its Employee Giving and Volunteering programme.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Week was introduced in 2017 as part of the bank\u2019s longstanding Employee Giving and Volunteering programme created to enable and encourage staff to give back to society through donations and volunteering. Specially designed to reignite acts of random kindness in the society with events that are tailored to reorient people towards the right values, it provides a veritable platform for encouraging the citizenry to intentionally create positive impact in their immediate environment. One of the main highlights of the first CR&S Week was the SPARK Initiative. S.P.A.R.K stands for Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness. But originally the \u201cS\u201d stood for \u201cStaff\u201d. It was changed to \u201cStart\u201d to broaden the initiative beyond just staff and encourage everyone else to be part of the kindness brigade. Also, \u201cP\u201d originally stood for \u201cPromoting\u201d but was changed to \u201cPerforming\u201d to convey the sense that participants are equally involved in actually doing kind acts and not only promoting kindness.\n\nHeld between 25 \u2013 29 September 2017 with \u201cPromoting Kindness: Putting You First\u201d as theme, the maiden CR&S Week was the first of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s financial services industry. It highlighted the role FirstBank\u2019s corporate citizenship interventions was playing in driving positive impact across various communities \u2013 all within one compact week. It was aimed at encouraging people everywhere to step out of their comfort zones, shift attention from themselves and their personal needs to others in society who have not been as fortunate as they have and perform a random act of kindness towards them. The first edition of the CR&S Week provided opportunity for FirstBank staff to give their time and resources to promote acts of random kindness within their communities and contribute to the welfare and well-being of others through giving and visits to orphanages/homes of the less fortunate and internally displaced people (IDPs). Within the same Week the bank held career counselling sessions with secondary school students across the six geo-political regions in Nigeria with FirstBank staff coordinating the impactful sessions that inculcated the values of financial literacy and inclusion in young students. Also, staff had the opportunity to nominate beneficiaries they believe are deserving of random of acts of kindness. Through this activity, Baby Ijeoma was nominated as one of the beneficiary that received corrective heart surgery in India which was in partnership with Vama Wave Foundation. The impact of the first edition went beyond Nigeria as FirstBank\u2019s subsidiaries in sub-Saharan Africa and the UK also participated, benefitting people and at least 22 charities in six countries.\n\nThe second edition of the CR&S Week held from 19 \u2013 23 June 2018. Themed \u201cTouching Lives: You First\u201d, the 2018 Week was intended to demonstrate FirstBank brand promise to always put stakeholders first. It focused mainly on five key initiatives/activities. First was the launch of a partnership with VisionSpring to advance social impact by providing vision screening and affordable eyeglasses for 10,000 low-income earners. This aligned with the bank\u2019s financial inclusion and financial literacy approach of promoting accessible and affordable financial products and services to disadvantaged groups with the goal of bringing these marginalised populations into the mainstream economy, improving their chances for resilient livelihoods and financial stability. Second were giving and visits to orphanages/less privilege homes. This was the biggest platform for employee engagement during the week. It followed a needs assessment of the orphanages to be visited to enable employees donate appropriate items, and employees responded generously, donating at a scale that had never been done before. In all, eight countries witnessed this initiative while more than 26 charities participated.\n\nCelebration of the UN International Widows\u2019 Day on 23rd June 2018, which coincided with the last day of the CR&S Week, was the third activity. Driven by the International Women\u2019s Society (IWS) in Lagos with whom the bank partnered to organise an empowerment outreach for 500 widows in Lagos, it provided start-up capital and capacity building required to successfully run start-ups and small businesses, to the widows. Fourth was a Career Counselling Day for over 10,000 senior secondary school students, as part of the broader FutureFirst programme of the bank aimed at ensuring the youth are empowered to be financially independent through fulfilling careers and the right financial knowledge. Fifth and final was the SPARK (Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness) initiative, which included a SPARK Day set aside in the bank for people to act within their individual spheres of influence to promote kindness. The initiative also saw the bank receiving about 200 internal and external nominations of people deserving of kindness, out of which 24 beneficiaries were to emerge. The 2018 Week was marked across Nigeria\u2019s six geopolitical zones with two states from each zone, totalling 12 states in all. It was also commemorated in the six countries/markets outside Nigeria where FirstBank already had subsidiaries \u2013 UK, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guinea, Sierra Leone and Senegal.\n\nIn 2019, the CR&S Week held from 1 \u2013 6 July 2019 with the theme \u201cRipples of Kindness: Putting You First\u201d. The theme was informed by the bank\u2019s belief that every act of kindness (regardless of how little or in whatever form) ignites a ripple effect that goes on without end. The year\u2019s CR&S Week focused mainly on the SPARK initiative, which had gained so much traction since its humble beginnings in 2017. A Kindness Manifesto for both internal stakeholders and external stakeholders was introduced. There were other new activities or initiatives. A Nice Comments Day was introduced for the first time and scheduled to hold on the first day of the CR&S Week. The basis for it, according to the bank\u2019s committee that oversaw the planning and implementation of the 2019 CRS Week, is the important place of words in the \u201ckindness ecosystem\u201d. The committee underlined this point when it noted as follows: \u201cOne of the truest reflections of how kind we are is our choice of words. That\u2019s why we have created Nice Comments Day to help build a kinder world [through kind words].\u201d\n\nAnother new initiative introduced in 2019 was the SPARK School Engagement, which involved launching the SPARK initiative in schools to promote the 3Cs projected as the pillars of kindness \u2013 Compassion, Civility and Charity. The schools \u2013 secondary schools across Nigeria \u2013 were to be visited to educate students on acts of kindness, encouraging them to make kindness a lifestyle. A crowd-funding initiative was also added in 2019 to enable both employees and external stakeholders donate to defined humanitarian causes, such as supporting widows, sending children (from indigent homes) to school and providing health care for the physically challenged and the old. As at August 2019, nearly N7 million had been raised through the crowd-funding initiative.\n\nThe regular initiatives/activities were also retained in 2019. There were visits to orphanages/less privilege homes. Widows\u2019 empowerment was organised in collaboration with International Women\u2019s Society (IWS), Nigeria to empower a select number of widows across Nigeria. The implementation in Nigeria covered the six geopolitical zones with activities held in four states per zone, amounting to 24 states in all. Six subsidiaries of FirstBank also implemented the programme in their markets/countries \u2013 UK, Ghana, DRC, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Senegal. In all, 25 schools benefitted with 6,000 students participating in terms of the School Engagement; 50 charities and NGOs, including Leap Africa and IWS, were partnered. Over 20,000 orphans/less privilege people including widows were reached and impacted.\n\nNo CR&S Week could take place in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions on public gatherings and visits. But FirstBank did not just fold its hand and sit idly. The bank did something absolutely amazing, demonstrating uncommon solidarity with a vulnerable segment of society \u2013 children. Realising that the harsh effects of the COVID-19 crisis were borne disproportionally by children, whose education and thus future were being endangered due to the lockdown and prolonged closure of schools, FirstBank embarked on a mission to do something about it. Working with partners, such as IBM, UNESCO, Robert & John, Curious Learning and the Lagos State Government, it launched the bold and ambitious e-Learning Initiative designed to move one million children onto safe online learning platform. The Initiative was to minimise the disruption to children\u2019s education, ensuring that they remained fully engaged during the difficult period and are not left behind by their peers across the (developed) world. There are already over 150,000 students benefitting from the e-Learning initiative in the height of the COVID-19 crises. In addition, the Bank deployed communication material to create more awareness of the SPARK Initiative and to sensitize staff, customers and the public during the unprecedented times.\n\nWhat greater demonstration of kindness could there have been in 2020 given the circumstances the whole world found itself, especially vulnerable children? So there may not have been a CR&S Week in 2020 but the same kindness narrative that has characterised all activities of the various CR&S Week since 2017 clearly shone through FirstBank\u2019s COVID-19 response, especially its e-Learning Initiative. In future, people would probably easily be forgiven if they assumed the e-Learning Initiative represented FirstBank\u2019s CR&S Week in 2020. FirstBank has demonstrated uncommon consistency over the years to its Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Week and the ideals it seeks to project through the platform. This has earned the bank the right to make the bold call that is the theme of this year\u2019s CR&S Week.\n\nThe question is whether we will heed the clarion call to adopt kindness as a way of life. Will we go out there and extend kindness to others in ways that will make them realise that kindness is not just a word taken from the dictionary but an act that should always be expressed to others? Will we embrace kindness as our new way of life? Will we commit to making our everyday a Kind Comments Day, thus giving others permission and the strength to do the same? Will we Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness towards all and make them feel obligated to start acting kindly towards other people as their new lifestyle?\n\nCulled from Nigerian Tribune\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

          "text": "Federal Government has flagged off the construction of the Kaduna-Kano segment of the Lagos-Kano railway modernization project.\n\nSpeaking at the Ground Breaking Ceremony in Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to reviving the Nigerian Railway system.\n\nHe said the project when completed, will not only drive the nation\u2019s economies through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation but will also reduce the deficiency in our nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis administration recognizes rail transportation as a potent economic driver and as such, has accorded railway infrastructure development the greatest priority it deserves and it is not surprising that several landmarks have been achieved, from the Flag-off for commercial operation of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway in 2016 to the recent commissioning of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project on June 10, 2021, thereby maintaining the pace for the actualization of this vital thoroughfare\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis project is crucial to the establishment of a supply chain in railway transport within its corridor, Kano \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Abuja, as it links the major commercial cities of Kano and Kaduna to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cthis railway connection when completed will establish the ports in Lagos, as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic.\n\nThe railway line will be linked to the second Port in Lagos, the Tin Can Island Port. It is also expected that the Inland Dry Port on these routes will be activated and the ports can now receive imports directly from the international market as ports of destination such as the Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano Inland Dry Ports\u201d.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi says the project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, and further create employment and promote trade.\n\nHe said \u201d The project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, create employment and promote trade. In the long term, the railway will help decongest the Lagos Port Complex and increase its efficiency as well as further increase the viability of the Inland Dry Ports located in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cThe scope of the railway project involves a 203km double track standard gauge railway from Kano to Kaduna. The railway along this route traverses the major cities of Kaduna, Zaria, and Kano with three (3) railway stations both for passenger and freight services at Rigachukun, Zaria, and Kano with varying capacities and categories\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cThis project will link the Federal Capital, Abuja with the Commercial city of Kano and also link the ongoing Kano \u2013 Maradi project. The outstanding addendum, Ibadan \u2013 Abuja, will link the Sea Ports in Lagos to Maradi, Niger Republic. This I believe will greatly boost trade between the two countries and foster economic development. This railway line will present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano via Kaduna with relative ease\u201d.\n\n\u201d The rail line is also provided with accessories and special installations including Power and Water Supply schemes, Signalling System & Communication in GSM-R, Freight yards, Rolling stock depots, and maintenance workshops,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna \u2013 Kano railway project is to link the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Railway project via Abuja, Minna, Ilorin, Oshogbo, Ibadan to Lagos on one end, and Maradi, Niger Republic on the other.",

          "title": "My Client Is Being Tortured In Cotonou, Igboho\u2019s Lead Counsel Cries Out",
          "text": "The Counsel to Sunday Adeyemo popularly known as Sunday Igboho, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), has alleged that his client is going through harrowing torture and pains, having been put in chains in a police cell in Cotonou, the capital of the Republic of Benin.\n\nThe Senior Advocate who spoke to our judiciary correspondent, Shola Soyele last night also disclosed that Igboho would appear before a court in Benin by Wednesday morning, for an extradition order.\n\nIgboho was arrested on Monday by the security forces at an airport in Cotonou while trying to flee to Germany. He had earlier been declared a fugitive by the Department of State Services (DSS) and asked to turn himself in.\n\nThere were speculations that Igboho had been released by security operatives in the neighbouring West African nation, however, the counsel said his client was still in custody.\n\nMr Alliyu however stressed that rather than being releases, \u201cIgboho is being treated like an animal in the cell \u201cbased on an order from the above.\n\n\u201cI got a call from a reliable source from the authorities in the Republic of Benin that Sunday Igboho has been put in a very dehumanizing condition in a police cell in Cotonou.\n\n\u201cThe police source told me that they are under instruction by an order from above that Igboho should be chained like an animal waiting to be slaughtered. He told me that Igboho was tightly chained to the floor and he is in serious pain.\n\n\u201cWhile I was talking to the police officer on the telephone, I could hear our client crying and asking that the chains should be removed as he is in pain. But the officer told him that they cannot remove the chains as they are acting on instruction,\u201d the lawyer said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Sunday Igboho Arrested In Benin Republic\n\nAlliyu, also restated that the extradition order being sought for by the Nigerian authorities may not likely sail through, given the status of Igboho as a political offender.\n\n\u201cI know that our client, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (aka Sunday Igboho Oosa), would be taken to a court in Cotonou, the capital of the Republic of Benin, tomorrow, Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities and security operatives that arrested him would be approaching the court for an extradition order to bring Sunday Igboho back to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut it is not likely that the extradition order being sought for would sail through. This is because of the status of our client as a political offender who enjoys immunity against extradition.\n\n\u201cLike I said in a press release earlier today, even his arrest by security operatives was against the political nature of his offense.\n\n\u201cThere is an existing extradition treaty between four West African countries, including Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, and Republic, which grants Igboho immunity from being extradited from the Republic of Benin.\n\n\u201cThe Extradition Treaty of 1984 between Togo, Nigeria, Ghana, and Republic of Benin excluded political fugitives. It also states that where the fugitive will not get justice because of discrimination and/or undue delay in prosecution, the host country should not release the fugitive.\n\n\u201cArticle 20 of African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights to which the four countries are signatories made agitation for self-determination a fundamental right to be protected by all countries,\u201d he said.\n\nRaid on Igboho\u2019s house and arrest of Yoruba Nation Agitators\n\nOn July 1, the Department of State Services (DSS) said a team of joint security operatives raided the home of Yoruba Nation agitator Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho in Ibadan, arresting 13 of his armed men.\n\nDSS Spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya in a briefing with journalists said the raid was based on intelligence that Igboho was stockpiling arms to cause chaos within the region.\n\nAfunanya said when the security operatives approached the house, they were attacked by nine of Igboho\u2019s boys who engaged them in a gun duel but were subsequently overpowered.\n\nAccording to him, two of Igboho\u2019s men were killed while an operative sustained injuries, however, Igboho escaped during the gun battle and is currently on the run.\n\nAfunanya who said the long arm of the law will still reach Igboho, urged the agitator to turn himself in or be tracked down.\n\nThe 13 suspected armed agitators that were arrested consist of 12 males and 1 female. A large cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered by the operatives.",

          "text": "Nasiru lahil Li Fatih society NASFAT, a faith-based organization, has joined Nigerians and other Muslims around the world in celebrating Eid-ul-Kabir.\n\nPresident of NASFAT Alh. Olaniyi Yusuf, congratulated all Muslims and thanks Allah for allowing them to witness this year\u2019s Eid. He stated that this time period has been described as the best of days in Allah\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days,\u201d our Prophet Muhammad (saw) said. [Bukhari]\n\nAccording to him, the last of these 10 days is the Eid day where we observe the Eid prayer, listen to the sermon, sacrifice animals and feed the needy.\n\nHe said the situation in the world calls for sober reflections and there is need for us to take heed from the life lessons of one of the great personalities this festival is revolved around, Prophet Ibrahim, who alluded to the importance of security of lives and properties when he said: \u201cO my Lord, make this city one of peace and security (Q14:35).\n\nIn his message, NASFAT Chief Missioner, Imam Abdul Azeez Onike said the deen of Islam attaches importance to safety of lives and properties. To underscore this fact, Salat, as compulsory and structured as we know it, is allowed to be done in a special way different from the normal situation, in peculiar moments, so as not to compromise safety of lives and properties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuran 4:102 \u201c.. (O Messenger!) If you are among the believers and rise (in the state of war) to lead the Prayer for them, let a party of them stand with you to worship, keeping their arms. When they have performed their prostration, let them go behind you, and let another party who have not prayed, pray with you, remaining on guard and keeping their arm\u2026\u201dAlso is Hajj: Q2:196 \u201cPerform the pilgrimage and the pious visit for Allah. If you are forcibly prevented, make whatever sacrifice is feasible.\u201d\n\nHe called on government at all levels, traditional and religious leaders, and all concerned stakeholders to join efforts to improve the security situation in the country and intensify efforts to secure the lives and properties of all persons irrespective of their locations in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, we also need to use this occasion to pray for succor for the people in Europe and other parts of the world, who have suffered various degrees of deaths and damages arising from the recent deadly floods.\n\nOn the dreaded Covid-19 Delta variant which impact is spreading so fast, he urged all Nigerians to maintain all the health protocols which the authorities have set for us and also get vaccinated. These will stop the spread of the virus.\n\nHe prayed that The Almighty Allah preserve our lives in good health.",

While wishing them and their colleagues in other Commands across Nigeria a happy sallah celebration, he charged them to remain vigilant at all times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor us in NDLEA, a kilogram of illicit drug seized by our gallant and courageous officers across the country is a kilogram less what is available on the streets and in our communities and that is why we\u2019ll continue to encourage all our officers and men to continue to give their best in our pursuit of the mandate President Muhammadu Buhari has given us\u201d, Gen.

          "text": "Giannis Antetokounmpo had the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in one arm, the NBA Finals MVP trophy in the other and there was a cigar on the table in front of him.\n\nAll the work it took to lift the Milwaukee Bucks from a team that won 15 games when he was a rookie to one with 16 wins this postseason was finally finished.\n\n\u201cThis is time to celebrate,\u201d Antetokounmpo said.\n\nMilwaukee waited 50 years for that.\n\nAntetokounmpo ended one of the greatest NBA Finals ever with 50 points, 14 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns 105-98 on Tuesday night to win an entertaining series 4-2 and cap off a joyous return to a fan-filled postseason after last year\u2019s NBA bubble.\n\nIt was the third game this series with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds for Antetokounmpo, a dominant debut finals performance that takes its place among some of the game\u2019s greatest.\n\nAntetokounmpo finished with 35.2 points, 13.2 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game while shooting 61.8%, the first player in finals history to reach those numbers.\n\nHe shot 16 for 25 from the field and made an unbelievable 17-of-19 free throws \u2014 a spectacular showing for any shooter, let alone one who was hitting just 55.6% in the postseason and was ridiculed for it at times.\n\n\u201cPeople told me I can\u2019t make free throws and I made them tonight. And I\u2019m a freaking champion,\u201d Antetokounmpo said.\n\nHe hopped around the court waving his arms with 20 seconds remaining to encourage fans to cheer, but there was no need.\n\nTheir voices had been booming inside and outside for hours by then, having waited 50 years to celebrate a winner after Lew Alcindor \u2014 before becoming Kareem Abdul-Jabbar \u2014 and Oscar Robertson led the Bucks to their first championship in 1971.\n\n\u201cFor the city, I\u2019m sure it means everything,\u201d said Khris Middleton, the other player left from that 15-67 team in 2013-14. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen the work that we put in over the years for them to get to this point.\u201d\n\nIn a season played played largely without fans, the Bucks had 65,000 of them packed into the Deer District outside, a wild party that figured to last deep into the Midwestern night.\n\nThe party wasn\u2019t bad inside, either: Confetti rained down inside as fans chanted \u201cBucks in 6! Bucks in 6!\u201d \u2014 a hopeful boast by former player that turned out to be a prophetic rallying cry.\n\n\u201cI hope they enjoyed it just like we are now,\u201d Middleton added.\n\nThe Bucks became the fifth team to win the NBA Finals after trailing 2-0 and the first to do it by winning the next four games since Miami against Dallas in 2006.\n\nChris Paul scored 26 points to end his first NBA Finals appearance in his 16th season.\n\nDevin Booker added 19 points but shot just 8 for 22 and missed all seven 3-pointers after scoring 40 points in each of the last two games.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a pain that goes with your season being over,\u201d Suns coach Monty Williams said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never dealt with this and so I\u2019m grateful, like I said, but I know this is going to hurt for a while.\u201d\n\nThe teams that came into the NBA together as expansion clubs in 1968 delivered a fine finals, with the last three games all in the balance deep into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bucks won them largely because of Antetokounmpo, a two-time MVP in the regular season who raised his game even higher in the finals and was voted the unanimous NBA Finals MVP.\n\nHe was the star of these finals in every way, from his powerful play on the court to his humble thoughts in interviews to taking time after Tuesday night\u2019s win to find children to high-five amid the celebrations.\n\nHe teared up afterward talking about the sacrifices his family endured while he grew up in Greece.\n\nHe did all this after missing the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee, an injury he feared could be serious enough to end his season.\n\nJust think what people would have missed.\n\nWhat started as a gradual rise for Antetokounmpo and the Bucks sped up in the last few years and they thought they might be here the last two seasons.\n\nThey had the NBA\u2019s best record in 2018-19 but blew a 2-0 lead against Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThey came back with the best record again last season but never regained their momentum after the season was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic in March. They were eliminated in the second round by Miami in the bubble.\n\nThe Bucks traded for Jrue Holiday before this season and even though they weren\u2019t quite as strong in the regular season, they were finally NBA Finals ready.\n\nAnd Milwaukee was ready for the moment.\n\nMiddleton scored 17 points and Bobby Portis came off the bench with 16.\n\nHoliday had 12 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds to go along with his usual sturdy defense that helped finally cool off Booker.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just a credit to the players,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing. We\u2019ve been trying to get better.\n\nThe players embrace everything. They\u2019re amazingly coachable. They take it, soak it in and make the best of it.\u201d\n\nFans began filling the streets and restaurants in the afternoon on what felt like a holiday in Milwaukee.\n\nThe Brewers moved up the start time of their home game against Kansas City to be played in the afternoon to accommodate Milwaukee fans \u2014 and Brewers star Christian Yelich, who was part of the crowd inside Fiserv Forum.\n\nThe game was tied at 77 after three quarters but Antetokoumpo had 13 points in the fourth to make sure Milwaukee wouldn\u2019t have to go back to Phoenix for Game 7 on Thursday.\n\nThe Suns returned to the postseason for the first time since 2010 but remain without a title and have never won more than two games in their three appearances in the NBA Finals.\n\n\u201cNobody probably expected us to be where we are except for us,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut it is what it is. Like I said all season long with our team, ain\u2019t no moral victories.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSuns: The Suns scored their fewest points in a first quarter in this postseason when they had 16. \u2026 Deandre Ayton, who was shooting 67.6% in the postseason, was 4 of 12 for 12 points.\n\nBucks: Brook Lopez had 10 points and eight rebounds. \u2026 Milwaukee\u2019s only other NBA Finals appearance was a loss in 1974.",

          "title": "WHO Chief Backs Tokyo Olympics Days Before Opening Ceremony",
          "text": "Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), has thrown his weight behind the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics, even as a surge in the Delta variant drives a resurgence of COVID-19 around the world and the event faces continued opposition just days before the opening ceremony.\n\nSpeaking to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Tokyo, Ghebreyesus, acknowledged the scale of the problem posed by the pandemic but drew parallels between the Olympic spirit and the need for governments and people around the world to work together to beat the virus.\n\n\u201cMay these Games be the moment that unites the world, and ignites the solidarity and determination we need to end the pandemic together, by vaccinating 70 percent of the population of every country by the middle of next year,\u201d the WHO chief said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMay the Olympic torch be a symbol of hope that traverses the planet. And may the rays of hope from this land of the rising sun illuminate a new dawn for a world that is healthier, safer and fairer.\u201d\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were forced into an unprecedented delay after the WHO declared a pandemic in March last year. Organisers have introduced a slew of measures, designed in conjunction with the WHO, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and ensure the Games remain safe and secure.\n\nBut rising cases around the world and in Japan, have undermined public confidence, increasing opposition to the event going ahead.\n\nTokyo recorded 1,387 new cases on Tuesday, bringing its total since the pandemic started to more than 840,000 cases. Some 15,055 people in Japan have died from the disease and more than 4.1 million worldwide.\n\nDozens of cases have already been linked to the Olympics, including a number of athletes, which has further undermined public trust in coronavirus mitigation efforts.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is a test. And the world is failing,\u201d Ghebreyesus told the IOC meeting.\n\n\u201cMore than four million people have died and more continue to die. Already this year, the number of deaths is more than double last year\u2019s total. In the time it takes me to make these remarks, more than 100 people will lose their lives to COVID-19. And by the time the Olympic flame is extinguished on the 8th of August, more than 100,000 more people will perish.\u201d\n\nHe noted that people around the world were \u201csick and tired\u201d of the virus and wanted the pandemic to be over but he said this could not happen until more people in more countries were vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe threat is not over anywhere until it\u2019s over everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone who thinks the pandemic is over because it\u2019s over where they live is living in a fool\u2019s paradise.\u201d\n\nRounding on wealthier nations, the WHO chief said that the world had not made the best use of the vaccines that had been developed, with 75 percent of shots administered in just 10 countries. In low-income countries, only 1 percent of people have received at least one dose, compared with more than half the population in high-income countries, he said.\n\nVaccines had been \u201cconcentrated in the hands and arms of the lucky few\u201d he said, adding that the failure to share vaccines, tests and treatments was increasing a two-track pandemic that was not only a \u201cmoral outrage\u201d but risked heightening the emergence of new, perhaps more deadly, variants of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy of this pandemic is that it could have been under control by now, if vaccines had been allocated more equitably,\u201d he said, adding that pharmaceutical companies should put profits and patents second in order to ensure wider access to vaccines.\n\nThe WHO, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and the World Trade Organization are supporting a global push to vaccinate at least 10 percent of the population of every country by September, at least 40 percent by the end of this year, and 70 percent by the middle of 2022.\n\nGhebreyesus also reiterated the importance of public health measures beyond vaccines \u2013 including testing, contact tracing, and quarantine \u2013 to control the spread of the virus.\n\nMany of the measures form part of the rules included in the Olympics\u2019 Playbook, which are supposed to help keep athletes, officials and media safe while they are in Japan and minimise the risk from coronavirus. Most events will be held in empty venues.\n\nThe WHO chief said the \u201d mark of success\u201d was not zero cases but that cases were identified, isolated, traced and cared for.\n\nSome 79 cases have been reported in connection with the event so far, according to official figures, with the opening ceremony due to take place on Friday.\n\n\u201cIn the 125-year history of the modern games, they have been held in the shadow of war, economic crisis and geopolitical turmoil. But never before have they been organised in the shadow of a pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although COVID-19 might have postponed the games, it has not defeated them.\u201d",

          "text": "More than 13 million Australians \u2013 about half the population \u2013 are in lockdown after a third state imposed restrictions to curb a Delta outbreak.\n\nSouth Australia, home to 1.7 million people, joined Victoria and parts of New South Wales in lockdown on Tuesday.\n\nIts residents will endure seven days at home after five infections were found.\n\nAnger in Australia is growing over the lockdown strategy, with the two biggest cities Sydney and Melbourne facing uncertainty over when they will open.\n\nLockdowns have been highly policed to ensure compliance with rules.\n\nUntil recently, Australia had been largely praised for its strategy of border closures, quarantine programmes and snap lockdowns. It has had fewer than 1,000 Covid deaths.\n\nBut the rapid spread of the highly contagious Delta variant has created new challenges and exposed Australia\u2019s poor vaccination rate.\n\nDespite entering lockdown late last month, Sydney reported 110 new cases on Wednesday, taking its current outbreak to more than 1,300 cases.\n\nResidents must not leave their homes except for grocery shopping, exercise and other essential reasons.\n\nConstruction sites and specialty retail stores have also been closed.\n\nThere are fears Sydney\u2019s shutdown could be extended into September, after modelling showed the city may need months to reach zero new cases.\n\nMany Australians have compared their situation to re-openings happening in the UK and the US, placing pressure on the federal government.\n\nLast month, a total of seven cities were in lockdown for a brief period.\n\nAustralian authorities have committed to eliminating local cases altogether until more people are vaccinated.\n\nLess than 14% of Australians have been vaccinated \u2013 the slowest rate among OECD nations.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s government has been strongly criticised, after he said early this year that the vaccine rollout \u201cwas not a race\u201d.\n\nThe slow vaccine uptake has been blamed on the government\u2019s failure to secure Pfizer supplies and public fears about very rare clotting from the AstraZeneca jab.",

          "text": "A new Covid health pass has come into effect in France amid a surge of new infections.\n\nFrom Wednesday, people need proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from Covid to enter most museums and cinemas.\n\nLater lawmakers will debate whether to extend its use in August for entry to cafes, restaurants and shopping malls.\n\nIt comes the day after Health Minister Olivier V\u00e9ran announced 18,000 new infections in just 24 hours.\n\nThis was compared to fewer than 7,000 cases a day last week, a surge of 150%, as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads throughout the country.\n\n\u201cWe have never seen this before,\u201d he told the National Assembly, saying Delta had led to far larger rises in cases than previous variants, like those first spotted in the UK or South Africa.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron announced the plans for a health pass earlier this month, as well as compulsory vaccination for all health workers by September. Surveys suggest there is widespread vaccine hesitancy in France.\n\nMr Macron\u2019s plans have proved controversial. Protests against new coronavirus rules in France saw demonstrators vandalising two vaccination centres this week.\n\n\u201cHealth Dictatorship\u201d is what protesters here are calling it.\n\nIf the government has its way, in a few short weeks, you won\u2019t be able to sit down for a coffee at a Paris caf\u00e9 \u2013 or board a train \u2013 without proof that you\u2019re Covid-free, vaccinated or immune.\n\nThis so-called Health Pass is the government\u2019s answer to infection rates that are rising faster than France has ever seen in this pandemic.\n\nAlready, from today, there\u2019ll be no routine access to cinemas, theatres, museums \u2013 no trips to Disneyland Paris \u2013 without it.\n\nBut it\u2019s the plan to extend that restriction to everyday public places \u2013 cafes, shopping centres and public transport \u2013 that\u2019s causing the biggest backlash.\n\nSome MPs have reported receiving death threats ahead of the debate today.\n\nAnd some protesters sparked fury last week by comparing these government restrictions to the singling out of Jews during France\u2019s war-time Nazi occupation.\n\nA majority of French people appear to support the plan, with many believing it\u2019s the only way to avoid yet another lockdown.",

          "text": "Massive floods in central China caused by record-breaking rainfall have left 12 dead and more than 100,000 people evacuated from their homes.\n\nMore than a dozen cities in Henan province, including its provincial capital Zhengzhou, are affected.\n\nFootage circulating online show people wading in chest-high levels of water on roads and train stations.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping said on Wednesday the \u201cflood prevention situation was very severe\u201d and ata \u201ccritical stage\u201d.\n\nHe added that the floods had already resulted in \u201csignificant loss of life and damage to property\u201d, and instructed all departments to prioritise \u201cthe safety of people and their property\u201d, according to state news agency Xinhua.\n\nHenan province, home to about 94 million people, has issued its highest level of weather warning. Local authorities called the floods a \u201conce in 100 years\u201d event.\n\nThe rain began over the weekend, with storms intensifying on Tuesday.\n\nBy Tuesday night, Zhengzhou and other places in Henan province saw widespread flooding. There were reports online of people swept away by fast-moving floodwaters, and cars and debris drifting down submerged streets.\n\nSeveral dams and reservoirs have breached warning levels, and soldiers have been mobilised to divert rivers which have burst their banks. Flights and train operations in many parts of Henan have also been suspended.\n\nAlso in Zhengzhou, some 700 passengers have been trapped on a train for at least 40 hours, according to local media reports. Passengers were reportedly provided food at first but this is now said to be in low supply.\n\nThe First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou Hospital also momentarily lost power on Tuesday night though this has now been restored, said a statement on Weibo by the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee.\n\nIt added that 600 critically ill patients had been transferred to another location.\n\nA 20-metre (65ft) breach has emerged in the dam in Luoyang city after it was damaged by storms, officials said. Soldiers have been deployed to the area and a statement from the army warned it could \u201ccollapse at any time\u201d.\n\nIn Zhengzhou, unverified video footage showed passengers in flooded subway carriages with water reaching their shoulders.\n\nRescuers were seen pulling people to safety using rope, while others stood on train seats to try to keep above the water.\n\nIt is not yet known how many people \u2013 if any \u2013 remain trapped, but hundreds are reported to have been rescued so far.\n\nMany of those affected turned to social media to call for help. One person who went by the name Xiaopei said in a post on microblogging platform Weibo that they were trapped in a train.\n\n\u201cThe water in the carriage has reached my chest. I can\u2019t speak anymore,\u201d they said. The fire department later confirmed that they had been rescued.\n\nAnother user said that residents in Sishui town were stuck on rooftops. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to swim\u2026 the whole village is about to be washed away,\u201d the person wrote.\n\nState media also aired footage of a flooded kindergarten where children were floated out in plastic tubs by rescuers.\n\nThe floods dominated Chinese social media on Wednesday morning, with many on microblogging platform Weibo praying for the safety of those affected.\n\nThe hashtags #HenanCanMakeIt and #HenanStormRescue were trending, with close to 1 billion views for each.\n\nLast night in Zhengzhou I had no water, no electricity, and no Internet. I only regained contact with the outside world this morning.\n\nNever in my life had I seen so much rain.\n\nThere was one hour where the rain was just pouring down on us from the heavens, and everything went completely white. We couldn\u2019t see clearly \u2013 and then the waters started rising.\n\nNow there\u2019s not much rain. There is a lot of water still on the roads, but it\u2019s slowly subsiding.\n\nHenan has experienced \u201crare and severe rainfall\u201d since Saturday, China\u2019s meteorological authority said on Wednesday.\n\nZhengzhou saw 624mm of rainfall on Tuesday, with a third of that amount falling between 16:00 and 17:00 alone, which \u201csmashed historical records\u201d.\n\nIt forecasted that parts of the region would continue to see \u201csevere or extremely severe storms\u201d and that the heavy rain would likely only end on Thursday.\n\nThe amount of rain over the last three days in Zhengzhou has been reported to be the same as what it would usually receive in an entire year.\n\nMany factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.\n\nPart of the Yellow River basin in China, Henan has several major river systems running through the province which are prone to flooding.\n\nZhengzhou, which has a population of 12 million, sits on the banks of the Yellow River itself.\n\nScientists have warned that widespread dam construction has exacerbated climate change problems in China\u2019s flood zone, says the BBC\u2019s China correspondent Stephen McDonell.\n\nConnections between rivers and lakes have been cut and disrupted flood plains which once absorbed much of the region\u2019s annual summer downpours.",
