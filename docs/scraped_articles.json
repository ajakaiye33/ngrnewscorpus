          "text": "The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, has assured Nigerians that the corporation is working with relevant agencies to ensure that the price of gas is affordable by increasing the volume supplied to the domestic market.\n\nKyari gave the assurance while answering questions from journalists during his courtesy visit to the Department of Petroleum Resources headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cToday, this country is undersupplied with gas; we can tell you that we are having difficulty filling our network across the country with gas. So that means that once supply is weak, it will affect pricing.\n\n\u201cToday, the supply mechanism of LPG is very weak. So, we are collaborating extensively to ensure that we are able to extract LPG from our gas resources so that it can be made available to the market.\n\n\u201cTo make price more affordable, we are working towards providing more volume of gas into the domestic market. By doing this, we make it very close to home and extend the networks, once supply is high, it will definitely bring down the prices.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of DPR, Sarki Auwalu, disclosed plans to increase gas production to 230 trillion cubic feet by 2030.\n\n\u201cLet me take this opportunity to inform the GMD of the NNPC that as at last year, we were able to increase the gas reserve with 3.6tcf.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Abia State Field Office of the Department of Petroleum Resources has said that the current scarcity of petroleum products in the south-eastern states was not as a result of increase in the official pump price by the Federal Government.\n\nOur reporter who monitored the scarcity of petroleum products in Umuahia, the Abia State capital on Tuesday, reports that the situation which started last weekend had seen many filling stations without the products while those who had sold at N220 for petrol.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Minister of Communications, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, has disclosed that the communication sector had priotised security over economic benefits.\n\nPantami made the disclosure during the official launch of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2019s (NCC) Strategic Vision Plan (SVP), 2021-2025, Podcast and the Book Compendium of Prof. Umar Danbatta\u2019s Speeches, on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nREAD ALSO:No plans to shutdown telecom services in Katsina \u2013 Govt\n\nAccording to him, the Ministry does not joke with security, adding that it aids the security institutions and as such compromises economic benefits that will have been for the sector.\n\n\u201cWe have even been compromising the economic progress of our sector because of our aim in supporting security institutions.\n\n\u201cAt any point in time in the telecommunication sector our position is `security takes precedence over economic benefits\u2019.\n\n\u201cSecurity is our priority followed by economic benefits. But if two things can be pursued, this one is our priority.\n\nOn the issue of subscribers\u2019 bio data, the Minister, however, explained that only the security institutions were constitutionally empowered to access that.\n\n\u201cWhen something happens and phone number is involved our function is to transmit that number to security institution like the Police and Department of State Security (DSS).\n\n\u201cGo to them and explain that your brother has been kidnapped and this is the number they used in contacting us.\n\n\u201cThe police or DSS know the procedure and they will communicate to the NCC or telecom providers for bio data so that it will not be abused.\n\n\u201cIt is because of this that only security institutions have the power to ask for that information.\n\nHe said although one\u2019s phone conversation was constitutionally confidential, the 2015 Cybercrime Act and a subsidiary legislation of the commission gave the Federal Government the power of interception.\n\n\u201cConstitutionally, your phone conversation should be confidential.\n\n\u201cLook at the Constitution of Nigeria Section 37 and 39 and see clearly that it is only the cybercrime Act 2015 and a subsidiary legislation of the Commission that allows government, that\u2019s when a crime is committed.\n\n\u201cThat is what is called `lawful intercept\u2019,\u201d Pantami said.\n\nThe Executive Vice-Chairman (EVC), of NCC, Danbatta, in his speech explained that the Strategic Vision Plan (SVP) took cognisance of all the existing developmental documents.\n\n\u201cWe have taken cognisance of the several notable advancements in the Nigerian telecommunications industry within the last five (5) years, as well as:\n\n\u201cThe current global realities such as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Strategic Plan (2020-2023).\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s Strategic Management Plan (SMP) 2020-2024, the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030 for a digital Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025 and the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThus, the new plan has been guided by and aligned to the NNBP (2020-2025), the NDEPS (2020-2030), the SMP (2020-2024), the ITU Strategic Plan and the ERGP of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, the new SVP 2021-2025 had five items, which included:\n\nOrganisational Renewal for Operational Efficiency and Regulatory Excellence, Facilitating the Provision of Infrastructure for a Digital Economy which fosters National Development;\n\nPromoting Fair Competition, Inclusive Growth, Increased investment and Innovative Services;\n\nImprove Quality of Service (QoS) for Enhanced Consumer Quality of Experience (QoE); and Facilitating Strategic Collaboration and Partnership.\n\nThe EVC also noted that the new SVP had inbuilt initiatives, key performance Indicators developed from inception and activities tied to an implementation responsibility matrix, which would ensure strong commitment to its implementation.\n\n\u201cIt also incorporates timelines and a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism.\n\n\u201cIt is equally outcome-based and ecommendation-driven with follow-up actions to guide the Commission in operationalising the plan and assessing its performance over time.\n\n\u201cThe new SVP, no doubt, embodies several innovative elements deliberately designed to re-invent and transform the telecom ecosystem within the context of regulation.\n\n\u201cThis leads to the next innovative project, the Compendium of EVC\u2019s Speeches and Presentations,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\nHouse Committee Chairman on Communications, Mr Hakeen Adeyemi, while congratulating the EVC, noted that the communications sector had become the major contributor to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product.\n\nAdeyemi encouraged NCC to continue carrying out SIM audit so as to establish more emergency communication centres across the country to boost security, quality of service, and reduce cost of data.\n\nHe also pledged the support of the National Assembly in enabling the Commission to perform its regulatory functions.\n\nThe book reviewer, Prof. Chidi Akujor, noted that the book titled: \u201cCatalysing Nigeria\u2019s Socio-Economic Transformation through Broadband Infrastructure\u201d had 531 pages, including 27 preliminary pages.\n\nHe said it had eight sections with each section corresponding with the eight-point agenda of the Commission, adding that the book would serve as a reference point for telecom sector and the academia",

Already the Federal Government has budgeted the sum of N37.5 B for this.\n\n\u201cThe issue was resolved to the satisfaction of all of us. Government is not delaying the hazard allowance as some people want the public to believe.\n\n\u201cSince the past six months, Government has been making concerted efforts to push the new hazard allowance into effect, which we are doing now but for disagreement between NMA and JOHESU.\u201d\n\nOn the upward review of retirement age from 60 to 65 years, Ngige said the meeting received reports from the office of the Head of Service of the Federation and the Federal Ministry of Health, which both agreed on the realism of the proposal.\n\nHe stated that \u201cThe matter has already been handled by the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation which has, in turn, transmitted same to the National Council on Establishment for further processing at its meeting in December 2021\u201d\n\nNgige said the meeting agreed that the issues of non-implementation of allowances contained in the 2017 agreement, such as consequential minimum wage adjustment and skipping would be taken holistically.\n\nRegarding the non-adjustment of CONHESS as done in CONMESS, he recalled that the matter went to the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN) for adjudication, following litigation engendered by a civil society organisation and the court remitted the issue back to JOHESU and its employer, the Federal Ministry of Health for discussion.\n\nHe said that they agreed at the meeting that if the discussions fail, the matter should be brought back for conciliation, adding that the meeting further resolved that other issues brought up by JOHESU, such as the 30 per cent of shift duty allowance to nurses and others, payment of outstanding allowance to intern health professionals, payment of teaching allowance to JOHESU members on CONHESS 7 and 8, as well as skipping arrears should be handled expeditiously by FMH.\n\nHe noted that the resolution of issues affecting their members in the state health institutions was for the Council on Health, adding that the Federal Ministry of Health has been directed to receive them and forward them to the council.\n\nHe added that JOHESU will meet with the Federal Ministry of Health on Thursday to draw up a framework for all the discussions to start.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will be ready to address all the issues. But we agreed that as a result of the perilous state of economy, the principle of capacity to pay will guide all our discussion.\u201d\n\nResponding, the President of JOHESU, noted that \u201cstrike is not the way to go,\u201d and expressed optimism that all issues raised by the unions would be positively attended to.\n\nOthers at the meeting from the Government side include the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, Ministers of State, Olurunimbe Mamora (Health) and Festus Keyamo (Labour and Employment), Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Peter Tarfa, and his Health counterpart, Director General, Budget Office, Ben Akabueze and Chairman, National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta.\n\nAlso in attendance were representatives of the Account General of the Federation, the Head of Service of the Federation and IPPIS.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We should reinvigorate our efforts, which are yielding results in the North East, South East. But there is more to be done in the North Central, North West, where people are worried and he has intelligence and information that schoolchildren and students are abducted, selective abductions and killings are done.

          "text": "From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja\n\nThe Senate will on Monday commence a three-day public hearing on illegal mining and gold smuggling and the attendant losses of about $9 billion yearly to Nigeria.\n\nThe hearing is sequel to a motion moved by Abia North Senator and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nFormer Nasarawa Governor and Chairman, Senate Committee on Solid Minerals, Mines, Steel Development and Metallurgy, Tanko Al-Makura, is expected to preside over the legislative activity.\n\nThe Senate would during the hearing grill major government and non-governmental stakeholders in the mining sector over the prevalence of clandestine activities of illegal miners.\n\nAccording to a notice signed by Al-Makura, the committee extended invitations to state governors; Central Bank of Nigeria; ministers of Mines and Steel Development; Finance and Budget; Mines and Steel Development; DGs/CEOs of parastatals and agencies under the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development; Executive Secretary NEITI; Nigeria Labour Congress, Nigeria Immigration, among others.\n\nThe senate at its plenary last year had passed a resolution to investigate the losses from illegal mining activities.\n\nKalu in his motion, disclosed that Nigeria lost an estimated $54 billion from 2012 to 2018 due to illegal smuggling of gold. He also said the country was losing about $9 billion yearly to illegal mining and gold exportation. He lamented the activities of unlicensed miners and incessant smuggling of the solid minerals out of the country by middlemen given the huge revenue losses.\n\nThe former Abia governor said gold mining operations in Nigeria was capable of providing no fewer than 250,000 jobs and over $500 million dollars annually in royalties and taxes to the Federal Government.\n\nHe said jobs and revenues accruing to the mining sector would further diversify the nation\u2019s economy and improve its foreign exchange reserve. He said due to Nigeria\u2019s current estimated gold reserves of over 200million ounces, most of which have not been exploited, developing sustainable programmes that would catalyse increased investment in the extraction and refining of gold sourced from mines in Nigeria, was vital.\n\nMaking reference to data obtained from the Ministry of Solid Minerals and Development, Kalu revealed that there were gold deposits in Federal Capital Territory Abuja, Abia, Bauchi, Cross River, Edo, Niger, Sokoto, Kebbi, Oyo, Kogi, Zamfara, Osun and Kaduna states.\n\nKalu argued that if the country conserves her gold reserves, and ensures effective exploitation, the accruing revenue would surpass that of oil and gas.\n\nHe drew the attention of the senate to section 44 (3) of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Law of 1999 which provides that ownership and control of all minerals in Nigeria is vested in the Federal Government, which is mandated to manage such natural resources in a manner as may be prescribed by the National Assembly.\n\nActing on Kalu\u2019s motion , the Senate in its resolutions mandated it\u2019s Committee on Solid Minerals, Mines , Steel Development and Metallurgy to investigate and launch an investigation on the matter and report back to the Senate.\n\nOther matters scheduled for the three day public hearing include bills on Nigerian Minerals Development Corporation (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB.505; Solid Minerals Producing Areas Development Commission (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB.713); and Institute of Bitumen Management (Establishment) Bill 2021 (SB.663).\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

He announced the commission would be carrying out a pilot test of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), a new technology that combines the functions of Smart Card Reader (SCR) and Z-Pad, during the Anambra governorship poll.\n\n\u201cIn the next two days, the commission will compile the register of new voters and publish same throughout the state for claims and objections.

On election day, the same device will become the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to be used, first, for fingerprint authentication during accreditation, and where it fails for facial authentication.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will eliminate the possibility of voting by identity theft using another person\u2019s PVC. Where the voter fails both the fingerprint and facial authentication, he/she will not be allowed to vote. In other words, no electronic authentication, no voting.

          "title": "Igboho vs FG, DSS: Court adjourns case to Sept 17 for ruling, judgment",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nJustice Ladiran Akintola of an Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, has adjourned for ruling or judgment on the N500 billion fundamental human rights case instituted by the Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, against the Federal Government and Department of State Services (DSS).\n\nThe court said either the ruling or the judgment would be delivered on the case on September 17, 2021. The case will be for ruling if the preliminary objections raised by the three respondents in the case succeed, but would be for judgment if the objections fail.\n\nThe three respondents are Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, as the first respondent, as well as DSS as second respondent and Director of DSS in Oyo state as third respondent. But the court sitting was held yesterday, amid tight security. Journalists were only allowed into the court premises with their identity cards and they were not allowed to take their cars into the court premises.\n\nAt the resumed hearing yesterday, the court delivered a ruling on the preliminary objection, raised by the respondents. Justice Ladiran held that both the preliminary objection and the substantive case would be heard together, which made counsel to the parties to open their arguments and addresses and concluded them during the proceedings.\n\nThe court also extended the restraining order against the respondents and their privies not to arrest, intimidate, and harass Igboho, and that they should not freeze his bank accounts till September 17, this year.\n\nOne of the main highlights of the proceedings was the presentation of video exhibits before the court by Igboho\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN), and counsel to the second and third respondents, Mr. T.A. Nurudeen. The presentation, however, attracted fireworks among counsel. The counsel to the first respondent, Abdullahi Abubakar, who argued that the video exhibits on how Igboho\u2019s house was invaded should not be played in the open court, but the judge could watch it in his chambers. This position was opposed by Igboho\u2019s counsel. But the judge cited a legal point on why the video should be played in the open court in the interest of fair hearing.\n\nThe two video clips presented by Igboho\u2019s counsel were tagged: Exhibit Oro 9A and Exhibit Oro 9B. The DSS also presented two video clips before the court, marked as DS1 and DS2. They were played via a television set in the court, as well as computers brought by the DSS.\n\nThe Exhibit Oro 9A showed video evidence of how Igboho\u2019s house was raided in the early hours of Thursday, July 1, 2021, by the DSS, as well as blood of the people said to have been killed in his house by the security operatives, and vandalism of his house and vehicles. A lady\u2019s voice was heard in the video, saying: \u201cThis is Igboho\u2019s house. See what they have done. They have destroyed everything,\u201d as cameras moved on vandalised vehicles and some parts of Igboho\u2019s residence.\n\nThe lady also said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who did this,\u201d which means the video had been recorded before the DSS addressed a press conference in Abuja, in the evening of July 1, 2021, that the secret police, in collaboration with other security agencies, raided Igboho\u2019s house in Ibadan, recovered firearms, arrested 12 persons and also killed two persons.\n\nThe Exhibit Oro 9B also showed a comment made in February, 2021, by Minister of Defence, Gen Bashir Magashi (retd), who took a cursory look at the security situation in Nigeria and told the people to embark on self-defence against bandits, kidnappers and other criminal elements. It also showed Igboho on stage addressing people during different rallies held for actualisation of self-determination for Yoruba nation, without being armed, as well as comment by an elder statesman, Gen Theophilus Danjuma (retd), that people should defend themselves.\n\nIn the video evidence presented before the court by counsel to the second and third respondents, Igboho was seen in the DS1, speaking Yoruba language on self-determination for the Yoruba nation, shooting of Yoruba leaders that refused to key into the agitation, and need for Yoruba youth to acquire metaphysical powers to fight for freedom against purported Fulani invasion of Yorubaland.\n\nThe second part of Exhibit DS1 showed Igboho, where he said he could not be threatened and that saying if security agents would come to his house, they should not come in the night, but during the day. He added that if 1,000 of them came, only about 100 among them would escape, probably using charms to disappear.\n\nThe Exhibit DS2 also showed Igboho\u2019s media aide, Olayori Koiki, where he said Yoruba should prepare for liberation war against the Fulani. It also showed Igboho, where he complained that the Fulani have allegedly been killing, maiming, raping, and destroying farmlands in Yorubaland.\n\nBut counsel to Malami argued that there was no material fact before the court that Igboho owns the house in question and the vehicles, adding that there was nothing to show that the blood that was seen in the house was that of human beings or of goats or other animals. He contended further that there was nothing in the video evidence that linked Malami to the raid on Igboho\u2019s house and urged the court to disregard the video exhibits and dismiss the entire suit.\n\nOn the preliminary objection, he argued that the court doesn\u2019t have power to hear the case because the case could not be brought under fundamental human rights.\n\nCounsel of the second and third respondents, Nurudeen also argued that he would not take the blood seen in Igboho\u2019s house as that of human beings, until there is a proof from hermatologist, saying the substance did not look like blood of human beings to him.\n\nHe argued that the Minister of Defence and Gen. T.Y. Danjuma did not have powers to unilaterally say people should carry guns, adding that the 1999 Constitution is very clear on who and who can bear arms in Nigeria. He also urged the court to dismiss the entire suit.\n\nOn the preliminary objection, he urged the court to decide it on merit because the proper parties were not before the court and that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nBut Igboho\u2019s counsel, Alliyu, argued that there was nowhere in the affidavit, where respondents queried ownership of Igboho\u2019s house, adding that the Attorney-General of the Federation is the chief legal officer of the country, and he can be sued. He contended further that the two video exhibits presented by second and third respondents could only be enjoyed in cinema, adding that the language spoken in the exhibits was not the language of the court, and that English language is the language of the court. He prayed the court to grant the prayers of the applicant.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars. Click here to apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022Warns against granting ex parte orders on political matters\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThree State Chief Judges (CJs) will any time from now appear before the National Judicial Council (NJC) to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for alleged issuance of conflicting court orders. The decision to investigate the judges was taken by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, after a meeting with seven Heads of Courts on Monday in Abuja.\n\nMuhammad had last week Monday invited some CJs to explain the rationale behind the issuance of contradictory court orders and indiscriminate injunctions by judges in their jurisdictions. The invitation was sequel to a report by THISDAY on certain worrisome restraining orders against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and some contestants in the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra State, as well as the leaderships of the major political parties in the country.\n\nA statement by the NJC\u2019s Director of Information, Mr Soji Oye, disclosed that the CJN, after a marathon meeting with the Heads of Courts, which lasted for over six hours, decided to use the three judges as warning to others. Although, disciplinary actions are usually taken against an erring judicial officer after investigation based on petition from members of the public, in this instance, the NJC is on its own investigating the three judges.\n\nThe statement was silent on the three judges pencilled down for investigation and possible sanction.\n\nThe CJs, who appeared before the CJN, are those of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, and Rivers, Kebbi, Cross River, Jigawa, Anambra, and Imo states.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe meeting, which commenced at 11am, and lasted till 5:30pm, began with a one-on-one interaction with the CJs. Each of the CJs was separately quizzed personally by the CJN for over an hour, before later reading a riot act in a joint session with all of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, the visibly angry CJN had stated that \u201ca damage to one jurisdiction is a damage to all\u201d and as such, they must put an end to indiscriminate granting of ex parte orders, conflicting judgements or rulings occasioned by forum-shopping.\u201d\n\nMuhammad was also quoted as saying, \u201cYour job as Heads of Court is a sacred one, and it, therefore, includes you vicariously taking the sins of others. There must be an end to this nonsense. You shall henceforth take absolute charge in assigning cases or matters, especially political personally.\n\n\u201cWe shall make example with these three Judges and never shall we condone such act.\u201d\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThree of the Judges who granted conflicting ex parte orders have been invited to appear before the National Judicial Council to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for granting the conflicting ex parte orders.\u201d\n\nMuhammad warned the CJs to henceforth avoid unnecessary assumption of jurisdiction in matters with similar subjects and parties already before another court, protect the court from lawyers who were out for forum shopping, and work in tandem with all the judges to salvage the image of the judiciary.\n\nThe CJN warned the CJs against making newly appointed judicial officers vacation judges and assigning complex cases to inexperienced judges.\n\nThe statement also disclosed that all Heads of Courts will be invited to a meeting to reemphasise the need for the judiciary to be circumspect on the issue ex parte orders. It said the Heads of Courts would also meet with the NBA leadership on the issue.\n\nThe CJN advised all Heads of Court to be current on developments in the polity and the judgments delivered by courts of various jurisdictions. He also told them to urgently issue practice direction to guide judges in their various courts to avoid giving conflicting decisions.\n\nMuhammad concluded that the judiciary will no longer condone indiscipline or allow any judge to tarnish the image of the judiciary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says it will negate principle of equity\n\n\u2022 Wike to FIRS: Stop bullying corporate bodies from paying\n\n\u2022Alleges Masari, others attempting to truncate court ruling\n\n\u2022 Urges govs to collectively fight for devolution of resources\n\n\u2022 Threatens lockdown in Rivers again\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nJustice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt yesterday dismissed an application by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) seeking to stop the Rivers State Government from collecting Value Added Tax (VAT) in line with an earlier judgement in favour of the state.\n\nPam held that granting the application would negate the principle of equity.\n\nAccordingly, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike warned the FIRS against sabotaging the authority of the state to freely administer the VAT in line with the court ruling.\n\nThe FIRS in suit no FHC/PHC/149/2021 had approached the court seeking a stay-of-execution on an earlier judgement of the court that stopped the agency from collecting VAT, and held that it was constitutionally the role of state governments.\n\nThe FIRS had following the judgement against it requested the high court to stop the Rivers State government from executing the ruling.\n\nPam stated that in as much as the state government and the state legislature had enacted a law with respect to VAT, the courts were bound to obey such law. He said the state government and the House of Assembly had duly enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax No. 4, 2021, which makes it a legitimate right of the state to collect VAT.\n\nThe judge maintained that the law remained valid until it had been set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nPam further said granting the prayers of the FIRS would amount to committing murder. He noted that the prayers could not stand and, hence, dismissed them.\n\nBut reacting to the Federal High Court ruling, in a state broadcast in Port Harcourt, Wike alleged that the FIRS was bullying corporate bodies and business entities in the state for refusing to pay VAT to the federal agency. He said Rivers State would not allow further collection of VAT from corporate bodies and businesses operating in the state by the federal government agency.\n\nThe governor argued that the FIRS failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgement.\n\nWike explained, \u201cFollowing the recent judgement of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt, which upheld the constitutional right and authority of state governments to impose, collect and utilise VAT within their respective territorial jurisdictions, the Rivers State government enacted the Rivers State Value Added Tax Law 2021 to regulate the effective administration of VAT in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cAs expected, the federal government, through the FIRS, disagreed and filed an appeal coupled with a request for stay-of-execution of the judgement before the Federal High Court.\n\n\u201cWhile the appeal was pending and without any stay-of-execution of the subsisting judgement, the FIRS went about to bully corporate bodies and business entities for paying the VAT to the Rivers State Government, even when they knew that an appeal does not serve as a stay neither was there anything to stay in a declaratory judgement.\u201d\n\nThe governor added, \u201cAs a mere agency of the federal government without any political authority, the effrontery and impunity exhibited by the FIRS against the Rivers State Government was ill-advised and highly provocative.\n\n\u201cHowever, being a government that believes in the rule of law, we decided on our own to suspend the enforcement of the Rivers State VAT Law 2021 pending the outcome of the FIRS\u2019 application for stay-of-execution.\n\n\u201cToday, the FIRS has failed in its attempt to frustrate the enforcement of the state\u2019s law on VAT with the Federal High Court\u2019s dismissal of its application for stay-of-execution of the judgement.\n\n\u201cIt is important to reiterate the fact that we did no wrong in exercising our legal right under our constitutional democracy to stop the continuing breach, denial and curtailment of the constitutional right of states to lawfully impose and collect value added and other related taxes within jurisdiction to the exclusion of the federal government.\n\n\u201cAnd in doing so, our singular and progressive objective was to contribute to the advancement of fiscal federalism by enabling the federating states to explore and exploit their potential and capacity for generating greater internal revenues with which to fund their development goals and reduce the out-dated over-reliance on pitiable federal allocation and other hand-outs.\u201d\n\nWike stressed that Rivers State would not tolerate any further attempt by the FIRS to sabotage or undermine its authority to freely administer VAT and other related laws in the state, saying, \u201cthose who play with fire risks having their fingers burnt. Enough of the shenanigans.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that some states currently with low economic activities and ethically restrictive social policies, with economic implications, might be adversely affected for now, but pointed out that it was not Rivers State\u2019s making.\n\nWike state, \u201cLike the right to derivation, this is also a constitutional prescription, which we all swore as political leaders to respect and defend as the supreme law of the land.\n\n\u201cAbove all, fiscal federalism remains the right path to economic self-reliance and sustainability for all our states and the benefits derivable from this case by all the states in the long run far outweighs the immediate revenue loss that some states may presently suffer.\n\n\u201cAll that is required is for all of us to wear our thinking caps as elected governors to collectively fight for the greater devolution of resources, responsibilities and powers to the federating states.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, very unfortunate that some state governors, led by that of Katsina State, are vainly conspiring to truncate this progressive reality in favour of the inequitable status quo so that the federal government can continue to rob Peter to pay Paul as the nation\u2019s self-imposed tax master-general.\u201d\n\nWike said the state government would continue to ensure and project constitutional rights to access all possible resources that could take hold both within and outside the geographical boundaries to advance the progress of the state.\n\nHe, therefore, directed the Rivers State Revenue Service (RSRS) to ensure the full and total implementation and enforcement of the law against all corporate bodies, business entities and individuals with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cAll corporate bodies, business entities and individuals are advised to willingly, truthfully and promptly comply with their tax obligations under this law to avoid the full weight of the stipulated sanctions, including having their business premises sealed-up.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the governor warned that it might re-impose a lockdown across the 23 local government areas of the state if residents continued to neglect the COVID-19 protocols. Wike disclosed that the rate of COVID-19 cases was increasing rapidly in the state, as reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He urged Rivers residents to comply with the protocols and take their vaccines.\n\nThe governor appealed to religious leaders and churches to convince and encourage their followers and members to go out and take the vaccines and comply with the COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe daily figures released from the NCDC show that both the transmission and death rates in the last two weeks have consistently been on a rising spiral because residents and visitors to the state have largely abandoned their responsibility to comply with the existing COVID-19 protocols.\n\n\u201cClearly, we are headed for a serious health disaster of profound consequences if residents and visitors continue to behave as if the pandemic no longer exists or impotent in Rivers State.\n\n\u201cThis is a big lie and we cannot afford to continue to close our eyes to the dangers such irresponsible behaviour pose to the health, lives and livelihood of everyone.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I wish to remind residents of the subsisting protocols on regular washing of hands and use of alcohol-based sanitisers; maintaining social distancing; wearing of face masks at all public places, including transport vehicles and going for immediate testing and treatment whenever you notice any of the symptoms.\n\n\u201cAlthough it remains our desire to keep the state open and allow citizens to go about their social, religious and economic activities unimpeded.\n\n\u201cBut we may be constrained to re-impose the suspended COVID-19 lockdown measures across the state if the transmission of the disease continues to increase beyond tolerable limits.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it has been proven that vaccinations are saving lives here and across the world and those refusing to take the vaccines for no certified medical reasons should know that they are endangering the rest of the citizens.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022With declining investments, Sylva calls for African Energy Bank\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nNigerians and foreign investors interested in owning shares in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is set for full commercialisation in the next six months, may need to wait till 2024, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, has disclosed.\n\nKyari, who revealed this when he appeared on Global Financial News on Bloomberg Television, noted that the national oil company, which would operate under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), would only be able to issue its Initial Public Offering (IPO) to investors in the next three years.\n\nHowever, against the backdrop of declining global investment in the oil and gas sector, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday called for the establishment of an African Energy Bank to help boost business activities in Africa\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nBy the provisions of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), NNPC, as currently constituted, is expected to transition into a fully commercialised business concern in which the public could own shares and take part in its major decisions.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman explained that the books of the NNPC would need to be to be properly cleaned up, with the proposed NNPC Limited recapitalised, before embarking on such a huge business decision.\n\nKyari stated, \u201cWe will be in a position to consider any IPO in three years\u2019 time. That is the provision of the law. But when you want to get ready for IPO, you need to do things differently, you need to get your books correct, you need to recapitalise; you need to shape your portfolio and many more things that you have to do until you get the IPO ready.\n\n\u201cSurely, it is not what we will do in 2022 or 2023. Probably the earliest consideration will be in three years\u2019 time.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC GMD maintained that the corporation was currently in a good stead with the declaration of its first profit in 44 years. He added that the IPO would put NNPC in an even better position in the oil and gas space.\n\nKyari said the corporation was concerned about the global transition towards renewable sources of energy, pointing out that the NNPC is in the process of adjusting its portfolio to meet future challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cObviously, this company is changing very fast and on the fast lane. We just declared profit for the fiscal year 2020. We are not getting ready for the IPO tomorrow, that is not exactly the situation.\n\n\u201cIPO really means this company is going to be profitable, it has a long trajectory; it has a short-term view of how things can be done better to align with the best practices in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to see how we can rework the existing framework for energy transition that is on-going all over the world. Every country is adjusting its portfolio by doing things differently in a better way and, obviously, in the long run, this is going to be a very great company and great companies always go for IPO.\n\n\u201cSo, this is not something that we are going to do tomorrow, obviously not. Our new law has made the provision that we can sell shares of this company, but in today\u2019s context, I can really say this company is doing great and getting an IPO means that it is going to be better than what it is today.\u201d\n\nKyari reiterated that the corporation\u2019s involvement in the Dangote refinery, for which it is paying about $2.7 billion, was to ensure energy security as well as tie down markets for Nigeria\u2019s crude oil.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the numbers and we think that if we invest in the company, we are going to get back our money in the maximum of five years and, of course, with the potential of having a dividend within five years.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing better than this. When it comes to buying a good refinery today on your own, you\u2019re going to have five years before you can get to this level.\n\n\u201cWe just saw an opportunity. Every company is reshaping their portfolio, trying to see how to do things differently so that you can spread your risks and cash in on any business that is on the way to progress. We know that this refinery will do well.\u201d\n\nThe GMD listed the three goals for the government\u2019s involvement in Dangote refinery to include access to petroleum products, some level of control over the company, and, most importantly, net market for Nigeria\u2019s crude oil.\n\n\u201cPart of our deal is for the refinery to necessarily buy at least 300,000 barrels of oil from the national oil company. We think this is a good deal for us,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its production allocation by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Kyari said the country would fill the shortfall by October.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI think by October maximum, we will meet our quota. The reason why we have not been able to do this is very simple, managing reservoir is a very complex thing, once you shut down getting back up is not that easy, and they are not going to come back from the same sources that you expected.\n\n\u201cWe are working with our partners to make sure that we take out some of the impediments to that, and we have seen very gradual recovery in August, the numbers are very different. So, we are hopeful that by October we can get back to our quota level and do much better.\u201d\n\nHe explained that Nigeria was not considering cutting prices for its oil, as being planned by Saudi Aramco, saying the demand for Nigeria\u2019s petroleum is still very competitive.\n\nKyari noted, \u201cEssentially, many of our customers need our crude for many reasons, quality issues and many other considerations. Even if we do react, it might not be on the same scale as the Saudis are doing. We have never done that.\u201d\n\nSylva Calls for African Energy Bank\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources yesterday called for the establishment of an African energy bank to help boost business activities in the continent\u2019s oil and gas sector.\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had recently projected that the global oil industry would require about $12.6 trillion investments in the downstream, midstream as well as upstream to sustain its innovative and production efficiency in the next 25 years. OPEC warned that Nigeria\u2019s economy and those of other resource-dependent countries might be badly affected, especially if the current push against fossil fuels continued to gain ground.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja during a visit by the Equatorial Guinea Minister of Hydrocarbons, Mr. Gabriel Lima, Sylva said since the Western nations were scaling down funding for hydrocarbon exploration across the world and focusing on renewable energies, setting up an African energy bank was a viable way to neutralise the threat.\n\nAccording to the minister, the call for the establishment of the bank is heightened by the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). He said the Act would open up the oil and gas sector for huge investments, going forward.\n\nSylva stated, \u201cThe PIA is a watershed moment for us in Nigeria. This is the time for us to get out of Nigeria to market this investment environment. We must not go out of Africa to attract investments. We must setup structures to fund our system.\n\n\u201cIf we insist on the exploration of our oil and gas reserves when the world is cutting down on investments in the sector, we must set a financial institution, an African energy bank to develop the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cIf we go into more exploration in Africa, we will find more oil and gas and must we leave it under the ground because the other countries are racing for renewable energy? We must find a way to explore it and that\u2019s why we need an energy bank along the line of the African Development Bank (AfDB).\u201d\n\nWhile calling for synergy among African nations, the minister noted that no country in the world would help Africa develop aside Africans themselves.\n\n\u201cNone of us can grow without each other,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt is not all the time that we run to Europe or America or elsewhere for support. We need to keep talking and we need mutual cooperation to solve our own problem. We can achieve this under the African Petroleum Producers\u2019 Organisation (APPO).\u201d\n\nWhile emphasising the urgent need for African countries under APPO to come together to work out a more realistic timetable for energy transition for the continent, Sylva said Africa needed to look inwards. He urged African leaders to close ranks through a solid platform to resist the clamour for sudden transition from hydrocarbon to renewable energies. He called for research into African problems in order to fully explore the huge potential of the continent.\n\nEarlier, Lima congratulated Nigeria for the historic passage of the PIA and noted that with the passage of the law the country was ready for serious business in the oil and gas sector. He emphasised the need for Africa to strengthen the South-South cooperation, stressing that Africa should not always expect to find solutions to its problems in Europe and America.\n\nLima said he was in the country to follow up on an earlier engagement between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea as well as explore other areas where both countries could partner.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Within four years, Wave has gone from a spinoff from Asia and Africa-focused cheap remittance company, Sendwave, to a mobile money service provider worth $1.7 billion; the latest unicorn startup in Africa and the first in the French-speaking region.\n\nThe billion-dollar valuation comes after it raised $200 million in a Series A round led by payments giant Stripe; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and unit of Sequoia; Founders Fund; and Ribbit Capital, with participation from other existing investors.\n\nNo other startup operating in Africa has raised as much Series A. OPay\u2019s recent $400 million raise is the region\u2019s largest venture round, followed by Interswitch\u2019s $200 million investment from Visa and Flutterwave\u2019s $170 million fundraise. All were Series C rounds.\n\nTaking on incumbents\n\nSenegal is one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing mobile money markets, according to a 2020 GSMA report.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of eight French-speaking countries in the region (including Senegal), allowed nonbanks to operate mobile money in its member states. Mobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by early telecom entrants that had the requisite infrastructure and user base (mobile networks and subscribers) to establish the service.\n\nOrange is Senegal\u2019s largest mobile operator and controls around 50% of the telecom market share with nearly 8 million mobile users, twice as many as runner-up Free, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Expresso Telecom, a unit of the UAE\u2019s Expresso Telecom Group Limited, holds 22% of the market share, with over 3 million subscribers.\n\nAll three telecom firms provide mobile money services under the Orange Money, Free Money, and E-Money brands respectively, and along with banks, dominate the digital financial services space. Other third-party providers like fintech have had to make do with small market shares while competing with incumbents.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut Wave, a product created by two Americans (Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk) to lower the cost of mobile money transactions, piloted in 2016 and officially launched in Senegal a year later, entered the market with a 70% cheaper service.\n\nWave offers free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application and applies a fixed transaction fee of just 1% for money transfers between individuals. Unlike its competitors, Wave passes additional fees on bill payments from users on to businesses. For users without a smartphone, it provides a free QR-card to transact with agents, who are able to open accounts, receive deposits, and execute withdrawals.\n\nAccording to co-founder Drew Durbin, Wave is building a mobile money service that is \u201cradically affordable\u201d. The startup has had to build its own infrastructure, including agent and consumer applications, an agent network, and QR cards in order to provide its super cheap service.\n\nWave\u2019s co-founders, Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk.\n\nThe startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nWave\u2019s strategy has managed to shake Orange in particular. To match the ultra-competitive offer that the startup has operated with since May 2020, the telecoms company was forced to lower its prices as well, bringing down bill payment fees to 1% from June 1.\n\nPressure on the network operator also saw it stop users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave\u2019s mobile application, a move that\u2019s been described as anti-competitive by the fintech company and resulted in a dispute currently in the hands of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator.\n\nWave\u2019s branch in Dakar \u2013 which is led by IT veteran Coura S\u00e8ne \u2013 claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal with over half of the country\u2019s adults, between four and five million people, making up its several million monthly active users. The Wave app has more than 5 million downloads on Google PlayStore. As reported by TechCrunch, the startup processes billions of dollars in annual volume and has partnerships with UBA and Ecobank for its Senegal operations.\n\nHaving previously raised just $13.8 million since its creation, Wave was able to attract the landmark Series A funding from investors to expand its disruptive business model, which has seen it become one of the most-used mobile money services in Senegal and achieved unicorn status \u2013 startups valued at or above $1 billion \u2013 as a fintech in Africa.\n\nOther African unicorns include fintech startups OPay, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Fawry as well as e-commerce giant Jumia.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Wave plans to deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into recently and is currently running communication campaigns to raise awareness. The startup also intends to grow its 800-man team across product, engineering, and business, as well as expand into other markets it considers regulatory-friendly, like Uganda and Mali.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "South Africa\u2019s 5G network might be on shaky ground; here\u2019s why",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, South Africa has made the most progress among African countries regarding the 5G technology.\n\nBut it appears South Africa\u2019s 5G network might be in trouble. But before that, here\u2019s the backstory.\n\nIn March 2020, the deadly coronavirus brought the world to a standstill as it swept through cities. Countries were on lockdown, schools were closed, and more people worked from home.\n\nThe ripple effects of the lockdown \u2014 Zoom meetings, online classes, virtual parties \u2014 meant that more people were using the Internet than usual. In South Africa, for instance, telcos saw a massive jump in Internet traffic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree weeks into the five-week lockdown imposed by the government, Vodacom, South Africa\u2019s biggest telco, reported that Internet traffic on its network had seen a 40% jump; MTN South Africa saw a 30% jump.\n\nIn June 2021, Teraco, which operates NAPAfrica, Africa\u2019s largest Internet Exchange Point (IXP), revealed that it had seen a 47% increase in data traffic since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s telcos, like most around the world, were under severe strain. A challenge made even worse by the fact that the country has not held a spectrum auction in over a decade.\n\nFor context, spectrum refers to the invisible audio frequencies that wireless signals travel over. It enables you to call an Uber, send a message on WhatsApp, and connect to the radio. Basically, anything that enables you to take full advantage of your smartphone.\n\nWhat helped?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2020, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) gave access to the high demand spectrums, with one being 5G friendly \u2014 on the 0.7 GHz, 0.8 GHz, 2.3 GHz, 2.6 GHz, and 3.5 GHz bands \u2014 due to the increased demand for ICT services during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President, Cyril Ramaphosa, had declared a national state of disaster and this temporary allocation was to last till November 30, 2020.\n\nTelcos so welcomed this development that South Africa\u2019s biggest telecommunication companies \u2014 Vodacom and MTN \u2014 launched the 5G network within months of each other.\n\nIt also helped telcos take on the strain caused by increased Internet traffic and provide cheaper data rates while allowing free access to health and education websites and free mobile money transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s 5G network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/26344495@N05/49713123696/\u201d>Ivan Radic</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nThree companies currently provide 5G services in South Africa: Rain, Vodacom, and MTN.\n\nIn September 2019, Rain, South Africa\u2019s data-only mobile operator, launched the country\u2019s first commercial 5G network in parts of Johannesburg and Tshwane.\n\nVodacom launched its commercial 5G network in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Pretoria in May 2020.\n\nAnd in June 2020, MTN launched the 5G technology in 100 sites across Johannesburg, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, and Port Elizabeth.\n\nA common underlying thread is that they all use the 3.5 GHz frequency.\n\nAccording to the GSM Association (GSMA), most commercial 5G networks rely on spectrum in the 3.5 GHz range (3.5 GHz-4.2 GHz). This is because it has been touted as the most suitable and appropriate frequency for deploying the 5G technology.\n\nBefore the temporary allocation, Vodacom and MTN did not have access to that frequency. Rain could only do so because it acquired Wireless Business Solution (WBS), which had access to the 3.6 GHz spectrum.\n\nBoth Vodacom and MTN agree that ICASA\u2019s decision to temporarily allocate telcos spectrum helped to fast track the launch of 5G in South Africa.\n\nFifty-eight of MTN\u2019s sites were deployed using the 3.5 GHz band. Some others use the temporary 0.7 GHz frequency.\n\nInterestingly, both telcos already had roaming agreements to allow them to access the 3.5 GHz band to deploy the 5G network.\n\nVodacom had partnered with Zimbabwe-based telco, Liquid Telecom, which has access to the 3.5 GHz spectrum. MTN has the same agreement with Rain.\n\nA fork in the 5G road\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, August 30, 2021, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) informed telcos that its emergency spectrum would no longer be available for use.\n\nConsequently, licensees have been given a three month grace period \u2014 August 31 to November 31, 2021 \u2014 to wind down their use of the temporary radio frequency spectrum.\n\nIn its statement, ICASA says that in reaching this decision, it has \u201cinter alia (among others) taken account of the current environment in relation to the number of infections, the gradual reopening of the economy and the steady progress in the vaccination program.\u201d\n\nAs ICASA told Techpoint Africa, \u201cThe temporarily assigned spectrum has been in the hands of operators for a period of seventeen (17) months since April 2020, it is reasonable that they be allowed a further three months until 30 November 2021 as a sufficient winding down period.\n\n\u201cIt has always been a known fact that the assigned temporary radio frequency spectrum would expire at some point.\u201d\n\nICASA believes it is time to focus its energy on the permanent licensing of spectrum \u2014 a decade-long problem that has plagued South Africa\u2019s telecommunications landscape.\n\nWhen MTN launched its 5G services, Godfrey Motsa, MTN South Africa\u2019s CEO, believed strongly that a permanent spectrum auction would have been done by November 2020. Fifteen months, several lawsuits, and ongoing settlement discussions later, it is still not certain when an auction will occur.\n\nTo put all of this in context, as of 2019, Vodacom was believed to be South Africa\u2019s biggest telco with the most customers, closely followed by MTN, Cell C, Rain, and partially state-owned Telkom.\n\nBut what\u2019s the story behind the spectrum battle?\n\nA decade-long spectrum wait\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa last issued spectrum \u2014 2.1 GHz \u2014 in 2011 to Cell C. Before then, the last significant spectrum allocation \u2014 1.8 GHz and 2.1 GHz \u2014 was made to Vodacom and MTN in 2004 and 2005, respectively, to roll out the 3G network.\n\nBut these frequencies are uneconomical for 3G, 4G, LTE, and 5G coverage in sparsely populated areas. Using these spectra would mean more mobile infrastructure leading to an increase in data costs.\n\nHowever, the problem with spectrum allocation dates back to South Africa missing its 2011 deadline to migrate analogue TV signals to frequencies below 0.8 GHz, freeing up room for much-needed spectrum.\n\nSouth Africa has not completed the switch, and ICASA tried to conduct a spectrum auction in 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2021.\n\nIn January 2021, MTN sued ICASA, challenging the Authority\u2019s decision to leave the telco out of the proposed March 2021 spectrum auctions.\n\nAs part of the auction guidelines, Tier 1 companies \u2014 telcos with more than 45% market share capital \u2014 could not participate in the bid. By doing this, ICASA had effectively pushed MTN and Vodacom out of the race to get the spectrum.\n\nIn March 2021, auction plans received a further blow after South Africa\u2019s High Court ordered ICASA to halt all auction processes, pending the hearing of objections raised by Telkom and national broadcaster, e.tv.\n\nTheir demands included ordering ICASA to first complete the migration of broadcasting services to digital from analogue by June 30, 2021, to ensure certain radio frequency bands used by broadcasters were fully available for use by mobile operators wishing to acquire them.\n\nA demand which experts believe might not be met until 2023.\n\nHowever, in June 2021, ICASA revealed that it was nearing a settlement breakthrough on the issue and told Techpoint Africa that the auction would hold \u201cas soon as settlement discussions have been completed between ICASA and litigants.\u201d\n\nSo what happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the three months until November 31, 2021, we are left with several questions. What kind of settlement would ICASA reach with litigants? Would the spectrum auction be held this year? Is there a possibility we could see an extension? What options do telcos have? What happens to data costs?\n\nAs to the first question, considering the grievances of the litigants, we might see a move to migrate analogue TV signals fully.\n\nWould MTN and Vodacom be allowed to bid in the spectrum auction? That depends on the outcome of settlement discussions.\n\nWhat can telcos do? Vodacom and MTN can fall back on their roaming agreements with Liquid Telecom and Rain, respectively. However, this does not solve the problem of network congestion, and we might see what Jacqui O\u2019Sullivan, Executive: Corporate Affairs, MTN South Africa terms \u201cdigital load shedding.\u201d\n\nBy this, she means some South Africans would very likely experience network downtime or reduction in download speeds as the system works to balance the load it would have to carry without the aid of the emergency spectrum.\n\nWe might also see increased data costs, except by some sleight of hand the spectrum auction holds before November 2021.\n\nHowever, ICASA told Techpoint that \u201cSouth Africans have always had access to communications services. The temporarily assigned spectrum was meant to assist operators with additional capacity to meet consumer demand during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the past 17 months.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the return of the temporarily assigned spectrum does not mean operators must neglect their licence obligations in relation to maintenance of the network and related licence conditions.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, ICASA had not responded to our questions regarding support to be given to telcos in the event of a digital load shedding.\n\nTill then, Techpoint will keep a close eye on this developing story.",

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s Founder\u2019s Table monthly series, where we catch up with founders in the startup ecosystem, learn about their failures, successes and a few tricks of the trade. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, after Ruth Iselema got scammed of \u20a6250,000 (~ $1200 at the time) trying to sell bitcoin, she saw an opportunity to solve a problem. At the time, there were hardly any structured crypto-trading platforms in Africa, just WhatsApp and Telegram communities, many of which she was a member of.\n\n\u201cEven though I did my due diligence, I still got scammed, she recalls, \u201cso I decided this has to stop\u201d.\n\nEnlisting a couple of trader friends, she set out to build a crypto exchange platform but things didn\u2019t work out.\n\n\u201cEveryone just had different views on how things should work, so we eventually went our separate ways.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUndeterred, Ruth set out on her own. The first major step? Leaving her hometown and comfort zone \u2014 Port Harcourt \u2014 for Lagos with barely any validation for what she was doing.\n\n\u201cI believed Lagos would provide me the energy I needed to pursue my dreams,\u201d she told me during a recent interview.\n\nThat bold stepped paid off, laying the foundation for what became Bitmama, easily one of the most prominent crypto exchanges in Nigeria and Ghana today. The Delaware and Neuss, Germany based startup, which employs a lean startup model, has over 15 employees working remotely and, like its peers, has successfully leveraged the peer-to-peer explosion to stay afloat of Nigeria\u2019s crypto ban.\n\nRuth Iselema shares her entrepreneurial journey, inspirations and ambitions for the future.\n\nWatch video version or continue reading below\n\nM\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 of Techpoint Africa (MM) : What was the inspiration for the name, Bitmama?\n\nRuth Iselema of Bitmama (RI): I started learning about blockchain and cryptocurrencies earlier in 2015, through a friend and a couple of Telegram and WhatsApp groups I joined. Just as it is now, I turned out to be only one out of maybe two women in the space. Because most of the conversations happened online and nobody saw each other\u2019s faces, people assumed I was an elderly woman. So they started calling me \u2018Bitmama\u2019 \u2014 a combination of bitcoin and mama \u2014 and the name stuck.\n\nMM: But how did a trained pharmacist end up in the blockchain space?\n\nRI: As far back as I can remember, I\u2019ve always wanted to be an entrepreneur. I remember I used to tell my dad how I saw myself sitting at the head of a company board and he would always respond, \u201cyes, you can do it.\u201d He even started calling me \u201cYour Excellency\u201d because of this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuth Iselema\n\nI\u2019m thankful for my upbringing; my parents ensured that we had computers and an internet connection, so I was very privy to the impact of technology at a very young age.\n\nMeanwhile, I had also started to develop an interest in finance. Even as a child, when most people my age only cared about cartoons, I would often ask my dad to change the channel to CNN, just so I could catch their stock price analysis. Noticing my interest, my parents started to buy me business and finance books, instead of novels, which I really hated reading anyway. I know he has some issues now, but I read a lot of Donald Trump; his books were quite impactful for me. I also read a lot of Oprah and basically any business book I could find.\n\nEven while I was studying Pharmacy, I continued to learn about computers and finance. So it was only natural that I discovered blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, which sits at the intersection of technology and finance.\n\nMM: How did your parents take the career switch?\n\nRI: They were very supportive. Interestingly, my dad wanted me study Computer Science because it aligned with my interests. But for some reason, I chose Pharmacy. So when I eventually went full circle, he wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\nMM: You practiced pharmacy in Ghana for a while. I\u2019m interested in what gave you the conviction to quit it and focus on an untested idea?\n\nRI: Honestly, pharmacy just wasn\u2019t for me; I am not built for the constant politics between pharmacists and doctors. So I returned to Port Harcourt, Nigeria in 2016 with the intention of pursuing the Bitmama dream.\n\nAt the time, Bitmama was basically at the MVP stage. Interestingly, our first website was actually built on WordPress, which is hilarious because the first time I saw it (I had one developer working with me then), I said \u201chell no, this can\u2019t work\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, I eventually decided to move to Lagos because most of the blockchain communities I was interacting with were based there. I believed Lagos would provide me the energy I needed to pursue my dreams. So later that year, I visited with the hope of connecting with the blockchain communities.\n\nIt was during that first Lagos trip that I met Damilola Thompson, then of EchoVC. She told me about Tech in Heels, a women-focused pitch competition which she encouraged me to apply for. Sadly, we didn\u2019t win the competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst from bottom right: Ruth Iselema with Tech in Heels 2018 cohort and instructors (Supplied).\n\nUndeterred, we applied to be among the inaugural cohort of Greenhouse Labs, a 3-month accelerator focused on early-stage female-led startups. After the interview, I wasn\u2019t sure if we did well so I travelled back to Port Harcourt, resigned to my fate. I figured that if we didn\u2019t get in, it\u2019d be my cue to recalculate my steps. But then, one Sunday afternoon, I got an email saying we had been accepted. Being accepted into Greenhouse Lab is what solidified my decision to relocate Lagos to focus solely on Bitmama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCirca 2018, Ruth Iselema pitches Bitmama at Greenhouse Lab launch day. Photo by BellaNaija.\n\nMM: So far, what has the journey been like? Is Bitmama still running with the initial plan you had for it or has it evolved?\n\nRI: Every entrepreneur\u2019s journey is difficult. Sometimes, people see a success story and assume everything happened overnight. There were times that I would cry, there were times I would have sleepless nights. On some days, I would wake up staring at the ceiling, wondering how I was supposed to pay salaries that week.\n\nOne particular period, I called my dad to complain and he actually provided financial support. At the end of the day, everyone needs a good support system to be able to take certain risks. If I didn\u2019t have that backup, maybe I wouldn\u2019t take the risk. Maybe I would have gone to get another stable job.\n\nFollowing our graduation from Greenhouse Lab, in 2019, the product evolved beyond the original MVP into what it is today. In simple terms, we provide a secure platform to connect buyers and sellers, who want to purchase cryptocurrencies, with each other. We also have a cross-border payments product. called Changera, which is currently in the beta-testing phase.\n\nAt some point, we also joined Seedstars, in a bid to get ourselves investment ready. By late 2019, just when all of these efforts were starting to pay off, the COVID-19 pandemic happened. Surprisingly, it didn\u2019t really affect anything. People were looking for what to do as they were at home and, thanks to hype from US celebrities, they turned to crypto. It was during this period that things started to stabilise for Bitmama. This year alone, we\u2019ve grown more than 50% from last year\u2019s numbers, and the year isn\u2019t nearly over yet.\n\nMM: So you branched off on your own to build Bitmama into what it is today. But definitely, at some point, you had to hire people. How did you go about it?\n\nRI: Mostly referrals. Sometimes I would scout online, for people whose coding skills impressed me, and reach out to them with an offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the earliest problems I had to deal with was the churn rate of certain key employees. Mostly developers, because other roles had a bit more stability. I struggled with this because, I guess, I was hoping most of them would weather the storm with us. Perhaps we weren\u2019t where they wanted to be. But at least, they helped us grow to this point we are now.\n\nThey didn\u2019t all leave though. One of our longest serving team members is our CTO, who has been with Bitmama for almost 3 years. He\u2019s practically employee number 2; he came in after the first developer who built our MVP on WordPress.\n\nI met him through one of our Telegram communities. I remember one of our earliest interactions; he impressed me by coding a quick smart contract and placing Bitmama tokens on the blockchain. I threw a few more things at him and he could handle them so the logical next step was to sell him my vision. I like that he was honest about his limitations at the time. He\u2019s now a bona fide blockchain expert.\n\nInterestingly, we never met physically until a year after, when we needed to onboard a new developer and he flew down from Abuja.\n\nMM: What lessons have you had to learn about managing people?\n\nRI: I used to be all about productivity and meeting targets but I\u2019ve learnt to be more empathetic to employee wellbeing. These people are humans who can fall sick, have families and personal needs.\n\nAnother skill I\u2019ve gained over time is the ability to spot those who are likely to stay with us longer, right from the recruitment stage. We are now more likely to take a chance on a fast learner with good interpersonal skills than some whose only advantage is good technical skills. This has also helped us reduce churn rate drastically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Ruth Iselema, CEO, Bitmama; Akin Asalu, COO, Bitmama\n\nMM: Asides talent, would you say there\u2019s an infrastructure gap in the blockchain space?\n\nRI: Definitely. The traditional finance institutions have left a wide gap. Following OPay\u2019s $400m raise, I noticed how everyone was quick to point out that they focus solely on PoS agents. But if the traditional financial institutions had laid out the proper infrastructure early, OPay wouldn\u2019t have to focus on something seemingly so basic.\n\nThis is why IMF and co will always tag African nations as \u201cdeveloping\u201d. Why do you think most of Europe doesn\u2019t trade crypto as much as Africans do? The infrastructure, from credit systems to everything else, was already laid down by their traditional providers. So even their crypto trading is mostly for investment purposes. Some probably even do it for fun.\n\nSo what we blockchain entrepreneurs are all trying to do is use this new technology to solve something that is broken.\n\nMM: What would be your advice for aspiring blockchain entrepreneurs and upcoming entrepreneurs in general?\n\nRI: There\u2019s plenty of room for everyone one in the space. Even the current players are yet to crack it. But here\u2019s my advice: people have already built, or have almost finished building the supercars (crypto exchanges). The next question you should ask is \u201chow am I building the tyres or the engines?\u201d \u201cHow can we plugin into most of these services to build a holistic ecosystem?\u201d\n\nEveryone doesn\u2019t have to do the same thing for everyone to be viable or important. There is still a lot of evolution happening in space. For example, we don\u2019t even have DAO or DeFi products, apart from maybe even Xend Finance, in the African market. Whether we like it or not, these are needed.\n\nI understand that sometimes funding can be difficult. One thing I have learnt is that most investors just want to see that you\u2019ve gotten from point A to B, before they commit to getting you from point to C to E, and handing you over to someone else to take it from there.\n\nPeople talk about mentors or mentorship. Sometimes you even meet your mentors in unexpected places. Most of the people I consider as mentors, I met them along my journey, often through simple introductions or chance meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d also like to say to women reading this that there are many ways to get into the blockchain space. If you want to be a developer, no problem, we welcome you. I must say, it\u2019s been difficult finding women to join the team, but we are on constant lookout for female intern developers.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve decided to do is to focus on growth and when I reach a certain point, I\u2019ll commit to dividing my time towards mentoring more women into the space.\n\nI feel the difficulty in getting women into the tech space stems from homes. As you can see, my parents didn\u2019t prevent me from growing up into what I wanted to be. But the story isn\u2019t necessarily the same for some many girls. I know things are changing but it\u2019s unfortunate that\u2019s how the larger society is. It\u2019s only a certain subset of women that have broken away from that. Everything starts from the home.\n\nMM: What is the vision for Bitmama, three to five years down the line?\n\nRI: Everyone will say \u201cwe want to be number one in the market\u201d but for us, the immediate priority is to cover most African countries and solidify our presence there. We also want to grow the team at a steady pace while staying lean. One thing I am certain of is that we are going to be one of the most prominent exchanges across the world.",

          "title": "Fintech escrow service provider, Vahlid, wants to protect your money in online retail transactions",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA report reveals that fraudulent online activities are projected to cost eCommerce retailers a whopping $20 billion in 2021. These double-dealing acts range from chargeback fraud and identity theft to website pharming and account infiltration. And buyers are not left out.\n\nBefore an online purchase, you want to ensure that the product is available as seen on the virtual catalogue and that it reaches you without any hiccups.\n\nIt is common knowledge that, like with most things, online shopping has its downsides, one of the most common being the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d challenge; a situation where the goods delivered are distinctly different from what was ordered.\n\nSome might argue that the solution to this is Payment on Delivery (POD), but this has some disadvantages, as fraudulent buyers can dupe unsuspecting eCommerce merchants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter escrow service\n\nThere\u2019s an interesting analogy to explain the work of an escrow service provider. Think of it as entering a deal with someone for an agreed exchange of an item of value, for instance, a wallet. Then you fulfil your end of the deal and call a third party to hold on to that wallet until the other person meets their end of the agreement. That third party is an escrow service provider.\n\nVahlid, a Nigeria-based fintech startup, is an escrow service provider. Founded in December 2020 by Adedayo Gbede (CEO), Olusola Agbele (COO), and Anthony \u2018Timi\u2019 Onibon, the startup was launched to tackle online scam in virtual shopping and Africa\u2019s eCommerce scene. Gbede reveals that this has been their driving force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Adedayo Gbede (CEO), Olusola Agbele (COO)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been scammed in different aspects of our lives and our work environment. It\u2019s either you\u2019ve been scammed, or you know someone who has been.\n\n\u201cSo, when we sat down to look closely at the problem we were trying to solve, we shared our own stories and decided that if this had happened to us, we should ask close friends and family to determine how broad the problem is.\u201d\n\nUpon hearing stories from close-knit folks and friends, the founders soon discovered the urgent need for escrow services in the eCommerce space.\n\n\u201cWe found out that a lot of our family members and friends had been scammed in the process of payment transactions for online shopping.\n\n\u201cTo actually see how crazy this was, we did broader focused research and discovered that 40-48% of the people we spoke to had either been scammed or knew people who\u2019d also fallen victim.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the problem and our respective technology development experience are why we decided to go ahead and develop Vahlid,\u201d he adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGbede, who has training in software engineering, data analysis and UI/UX design, is a computer science graduate from Valley View University Accra, Ghana.\n\nAgbele, who initially worked with Pluralsight as a software engineer, holds a BSc. in chemical engineering from the University of Lagos.\n\nTimi is a trained architect with a knack for actively seeking ways to solve problems leveraging technology.\n\nAs more Africans put aside their initial scepticism about online shopping, it is important to ensure the safety of both merchants and buyers. Gbede says it is not out of place to picture Vahlid as the scam police.\n\n\u201cSo, in the marketplace, we offer a middleman service between buyers and sellers. Because offline and online, you find many people misrepresenting themselves and stealing other people\u2019s money.\n\n\u201cSay you want to buy a bag from me, and then I promise to deliver the product to you upon payment, you pay directly into my account, and then I cut you off, I don\u2019t call you back, I don\u2019t deliver, and then your money is gone.\n\n\u201cAnd you find a whole lot of that happening in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s a WhatsApp, Instagram, or Twitter store, or a big eCommerce platform. The core of our business is bringing trust into the marketplace.\u201d\n\nVahlid enables buyers to pay through its platform and then holds on to the money until the seller delivers the expected product. It also protects sellers from prospective fraudulent buyers.\n\nOn the seller\u2019s side, it\u2019s commonplace to see situations where buyers commit to paying for items upon delivery but fail to do so when dispatch riders show you at their doorsteps.\n\nVahlid comes in as an intermediary between the poles of merchandise and purchase, ensuring that both parties fulfil their obligations.\n\n\u201cSince the buyer pays into escrow, they don\u2019t need to know who the seller is, just as the seller has no idea who the buyer is. The seller sees that money has been paid on their behalf and goes ahead to deliver.\n\nOnce the buyer certifies that the delivered item matches their order, they pay the seller,\u201d Gbede explains.\n\nHe emphasises that it helps buyers and sellers avoid fraud and cases of unmet expectations.\n\n\u201cIt cancels the need for going to the bank to cancel the transaction or reporting to the police. It puts the buyer in control, and it also puts the seller in control, ensuring the agreed parties meet all the objectives necessary.\u201d\n\nHe further states that although the startup is focused on building trust in financial transactions for online retail and eCommerce platforms, their services also extend to milestone payments for freelance work.\n\n\u201cRight now, escrow service is at the forefront of what we\u2019re delivering to the market. Beyond that, the trust issue is in other aspects of financial transactions.\n\n\u201cSay someone wants to employ you to do work for them, but they might not want to pay you all the money upfront until the job is completed; they can use Vahlid to pay in milestones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll put the money per agreed milestones, and we release the money as they hit each milestone. If any tier is not hit, we refund the amount left to you.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the service can be accessed via its web application at Vahlid.com. However, Gbede reveals that a mobile application is in the works and should launch on Android and iOS devices this month.\n\n\u201cOur website is up and running, so you can sign up on the web app. Our mobile app should be out, give or take, in September. Right now, we\u2019re on track to being the first escrow service mobile app for Android and iOS devices in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn sustainability and modus operandi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vahlid Team\n\nLike Vesicash, a Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) portfolio escrow service startup, Vahlid runs a B2B2C model, with an arm handling B2C and charges determined by transaction size.\n\n\u201cWe charge buyers a transaction fee depending on the scale of the transaction. On our website, you can see our transaction fee model. We charge between 1.5% and 2.5% of the transaction. Then there\u2019s a flat fee for the seller when they get the money and are about to check out,\u201d Gbede submits.\n\nThe escrow service field is not a novel industry despite only a few players on the continent, and Vahlid is not without competitors in Africa, including PayScrow, Vesicash, and Atarapay.\n\nHowever, Vahlid\u2019s trained focus on the eCommerce sector, instead of only individuals and a broad range of businesses, sets them apart from their competition. Gbede adds that Vahlid\u2019s affordability and user interface model are important differentiators.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the most affordable and user-friendly escrow platforms in Nigeria. We offer a unique system whereby once you sign up with Vahlid, you can be a buyer, a seller or an organisation with the same ID. Your dashboard as a user is segmented to reflect every transaction undertaken in the different aspects.\u201d\n\nHe also reiterates sellers protection on the platform with Vahlid\u2019s raise a dispute feature.\n\n\u201cAs a buyer, you cannot pay for goods and services and invalidate the transaction after it\u2019s been confirmed by the seller that your goods have been delivered. If there\u2019s an issue, you raise a dispute, and our Dispute Resolution and Compliance team gets on the issue to ensure sellers are protected.\u201d\n\nSellers and buyers confirm shipments and deliveries respectively via the app. After the buyer gets a notification that the seller has confirmed shipment, they validate the transaction by confirming that the goods have been delivered.\n\nPlans for the future\n\nCurrently, the platform gets most of its revenue from transaction charges. Speaking about plans for funding, Gbede says he believes growth and user traction are essential right now.\n\n\u201cThe more we talk to potential users, the more we realise that many people are actually surprised that such a solution as escrow services exist. Some have even come to see scams as normal. As much as we\u2019re open to investors, a major challenge right now is sensitising more people on the importance of the value we\u2019re offering.\u201d\n\nExpressing confidence in the brand\u2019s relevance, Gbede shares that Vahlid\u2019s scalability is hinged on the magnitude of the problem it is solving.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk of profitability, you need to look at it in terms of the scale of the problem you\u2019re trying to solve and the addressable market. The problem we\u2019re solving exists, and it\u2019s deep, and all the channels we intend plugging into reflect the large-scale viability of the solution we\u2019re offering. So for revenue projections, we\u2019re solid.\u201d\n\nFrom WhatsApp and Instagram-based stores to established eCommerce giants like Jumia and Konga, online fraud spares no one. In 2020, Konga\u2019s Co-CEO, Prince Nnamdi Ekeh, revealed that the company operates at a loss of about \u20a6100m per month, mainly because of eCommerce fraud.\n\nSad as it is, the situation cannot be extinguished in one fell swoop. Vahlid is looking to establish mergers to reduce the number of fraudulent activities in the space, with a view to eliminating them over time.\n\n\u201cThe e-marketplace is massive, and that is why there\u2019s a need for some sanitation when it comes to scams. The tech ecosystem in Nigeria will grow faster if there are more collaborations, but there\u2019s a lot of fragmenting. We are speaking to a lot of eCommerce platforms right now, so you can check out through escrow and pay through Vahlid.\u201d\n\nVahlid\u2019s long-term plans include a foray into Ghana, addition of new product offerings to include escrow services for real estate, and the expansion of the current team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu have tasked universities and research institutions to work in synergy in pursuit of the country\u2019s economic prosperity and technological advancement.\n\nThe duo made the call when the minister paid the governor a courtesy visit at the Government House in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\nObaseki, who commended the minister for his efforts at uniting institutions across the country to propel development in the nation, called on the Federal Government to allow states to have significant control over research institutes, particularly that of oil palm and rubber.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are proud of your initiative in trying to bring everybody together under one sector, which is the Nigerian sector: the ministry is an enabler in the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cWhat you have started is the right way to go and we have no choice, but execution is the issue. There is nothing new in this country, but everything said has been written and researched over again. Things have not changed because of self-interest, not national interest.\n\n\u201cI assure the minister that Edo State is ready to work with the ministry as the state is blessed with different federal institutions in the state, but they work independently rather than working together to develop the state and nation at large.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIf we want to thoroughly develop this country, the Federal Government should understand that the ministry is an instigator, as well an enabler that makes things happen.\n\n\u201cGovernment should be responsible for making sure that all the institutions in the state deliver to the people; whether in industry, agriculture, or all other sectors in the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Onu said the synergy among the institutions was imperative to boost the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAll the centres of knowledge in the nation; be it university, research laboratories, institutes, or polytechnics, have all been working independently on their own as if others don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not good enough for Nigeria as a nation.\n\n\u201cIt has created a tremendous problem for the nation, as we have our problems that we need to collaborate to solve, but instead, we now import everything that we need. It\u2019s not good for us as a nation. We now export jobs and have a serious unemployment problem in the country. This can only be checked if we start producing in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe minister further stated: \u201cWe want to establish technology and innovation centres for global competitiveness. These centres will be established in the six geo-political zones as all the universities, polytechnics, research laboratories and institutes in each of the zones will come together to collaborate in order to help accelerate development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will no longer allow all these centres of knowledge to work independently, but rather start working together to enable them to carry out good research that will solve the nation\u2019s problems. The collaboration will enable commercialization, and standardization will be made easy.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026govt urges full vaccination to get complete protection against virus\n\nEdo State has recorded four more COVID-19-related deaths, bringing the total number of fatalities recorded in the third wave of the pandemic in the state to 26.\n\nHead of the state\u2019s COVID-19 Case Management, Dr. Ebomwonyi Osagie, disclosed this on Tuesday during a press briefing at the Government House in Benin City.\n\nHe said the state, in the last 24 hours, also confirmed 14 new cases and recorded three new recoveries, with 592 active cases that are being managed at various treatment and isolation centres in the state.\n\n\u201cOver the weekend, we collected a total of 1,273 samples and confirmed 148 cases, four recoveries, and four deaths. From the weekend till date, we have had a total of 8 deaths,\u201d Osagie noted.\n\nHe said three out of the four deaths recorded in the state are unvaccinated, while the other one was partially vaccinated, adding that taking just one dose of the vaccine is not enough to prevent the virus from affecting people.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWhen you have partial vaccination, it covers you for a period of time pending when the coverage expires.

You must complete the vaccination; you can\u2019t take one dose and say it is enough but need to complete the dose which protects you from the virus.

Each jab protects you for a certain period. I urge Edo citizens to please show up for their second dose as there is enough for them.\n\n\u201cMany persons carrying the virus are not down with sickness and don\u2019t have symptoms but yet transmit the virus to people.

It is a major encouragement for our teams and partners, and a great recognition of more than 15 years of engagement to make our company and the world greener and more inclusive. Sustainability is a journey that we accomplish with our people, partners, suppliers, customers and communities where we operate. This recognition goes also to all of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Corporate Knights, Schneider Electric has helped customers manage their energy needs more efficiently and safely.\n\nCorporate Knights\u2019 2021 ranking was based on an assessment of 8,080 companies with more than US$1 billion in revenues. Performance indicators include evaluations of how much renewable energy and waste companies generate\n\nSpeaking, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Corporate Knights, Toby Heaps said,\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, Schneider Electric has shifted its focus to data centres; storage and other distributed energy resources; and smart solutions that advance electrification, energy efficiency and renewability. It now earns 70% of its revenue from, and directs 73% of its investments toward, sustainable solutions, Schneider Electric also performs strongly in racial and gender diversity and in resource productivity and safety.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, General Manager, Sub-Saharan Africa, Process Automation, Schneider Electric, Ajibola Akindele, has called on stakeholders of Nigeria\u2019s power sector to augment investment in the power sector so as to enable the country achieve her industrialization goal.\n\nAkindele who gave the charge recently, in an interview with Arise TV, averred that, the country needs to create the necessary framework for private sector investments.\n\n\u201cWe have had several years of under-investment in the power sector.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at the last 30 years, particularly between 1989, to 2007, there was no major investment in the power sector.\n\n\u201cThe country was just spending enough to stabilize the grid infrastructure. The sector needs investments in order to accelerate GDP growth and create jobs,\u201d said Akindele\u201d.\n\nHe further noted that based on general consensus by experts in the power sector, the country needs between $3-5 billion annual spend over the next 15 years to achieve industrialization.\n\nWhile admitting that these are huge amounts, he however said, expects that some funding could come from Government, International Development Agencies and from the Private sector. All available funding options must be explored and investors should be given the necessary incentives and where necessary guarantees to ensure they can make a decent return on their investments.\n\nHe hinted that, although in recent times, there has been some positive developments in the power sector, it was still not adequate; hence the need to move much faster to improve electrification rates and reliability of the grid.\n\n...",

          "title": "Nigerian states groan over debt overhang",
          "text": "By Okechukwu Onyenweaku\n\nOne of the most disturbing problems plaguing Nigeria today is the huge debt overhang. As event of the days unfold, the country\u2019s total documented debt stock is put at N33trillion and is expected to hit N40trillion at the end of 2021 because the government is still accumulating new debt. What has become more worrying is that the country is running into a hitch with servicing the huge debt. As at today the country spends over 91% of its revenue to service debt.\n\nThe Nigerian national basket case is similar to the grave conditions of the states also. In recent times, the 36 states of Nigeria have also found themselves neck deep in debt. The states have ,in fact, been struggling to survive given that only a few of them can pay salaries as and when due.\n\nAccording to a document released by the Debt Management Office in March 31, 2021, states were owing as much as N4.12trillion. This is different from other debts owed by these States that have not been officially documented.\n\nLooking at the debts of the individual states, Lagos State is the highest debtor with N507.37billion, Rivers State followed with N260.93billion, Akwa Ibom owes N232.20billion while Delta States is owing N213.78billion.\n\nIn the second category, Rivers State is indebted to the tune of N162.34billion, Ogun State N156.33billion, Imo State N149.88billion, Bayelsa State N142.93billion Plateau State N134.22billion, Osun State N133.92billion, Benue State N128.25billion and Kano State N119.42billion.\n\nIn the third category, Bauchi States owes N100.79billion, Taraba State is owing N100billion and Zamfara, Adamawa and Borno States owe N96.980billion, N95.22billion and N91.855billion in that order. Ekiti is indebted to the tune of N83.473billion, Gombo State is struggling with debts of N82.473billion, Edo State has debt of N81.750billion, Ondo State N72.598billion, Abia State N70.570billion, FCT N69.532billion, Kogi State N68.860 billion, Enugu State N68.855billion, Kaduna State N68.754billion, Kwara State N63.243billion, Niger State N62.327billlion and Yobe State N60.094 billion. Equally, Anambra, Nasarawa and Katsina states owe N59.710billion, N58.671billion and N58.339billion.\n\nEbonyi States owes N43billion, Sokoto N38billion and Jigawa N31billion.\n\nUnfortunately, as the debts on the shoulders of these states continue to expand, their internally generated revenues are shrinking given the harsh economic environment. The economy in the recent times have barely grown no thanks to the fluctuating price of crude and the ravaging effect of Covid-19 whose deaths have hit over 4million all over the world.\n\nThe bad situation seems to have been worsened by the fact that these states spend not less than 75 to 80 per cent of their revenues on recurrent expenditure with little or nothing left for capital expenditure.\n\nAnxiety is rising as experts fear that huge debts eventually cause deep challenges for the debtor.\n\nThey argue that given the nation\u2019s economic and infrastructure challenges, such as import of petroleum products, high exchange and interest rates, high unemployment, poor power supply and bad road network etc, high debt profile will not only create an overhang but simply strangulate the country and the states as the ability to repay may be seriously constrained.\n\nAs at today, the debt profiles of about 18 states exceed their gross and net revenues by more than 200 per cent.\n\nIn fact, the debt status of many states exceed the debt to revenue ratio by more than 100 per cent.\n\nThe debt to net revenue ratio of the states have put some of the states in even more precarious situations. In fact, observers say that most of them can no longer pay salaries and pensions as at when due.\n\nWhat has even aggravated their debt challenges is the bailout fund which the federal government extended to them in 2016 and 2018. This fund that is estimated to be about N614billion was given to the states to enable them meet their financial obligations to their citizens.\n\nThe Federal Government, which had earlier planned to recover the funds in 2019 before the pandemic, has now started deductions from states for repayment of the budget support facility, amid an already strained relationship from deficit financing, shortfalls in its Federation Accounts.\n\nStates which are unable to increase their internally generated revenues, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) as a result of the pandemic, may begin to default in payment of salaries. Of course, the development is reflecting a repeat of 2016 where nearly two-thirds of the 36 states struggled to pay civil servants\u2019 salaries despite receiving a government bailout.\n\nResearch shows that already, about 23 States owe salaries and pensions. These states include Abia, Benue, Bayelsa, Kogi, Delta, Kaduna, Edo, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ondo,Ekiti, Imo, Oyo, Adamawa, Rivers, Plateau, Akwa Ibom, Taraba, Ebonyi, Cross River, Ogun, Zamfara and FCT Abuja.\n\nRecently, too, BudgiT, a Nigerian civic organization that applies technology for citizens\u2019 engagement with institutional improvement to facilitate societal change observed that about 13 of these states are already technically insolvent.\n\n\u2018\u2019States already face significant human development issues \u2013 poverty , unemployment underemployment, avoidable disease outbreaks (excluding COVID -19) and a host of third-world problems. To solve these issues, each state needs to, first and foremost, be a sustainable subnational entity \u2013 that is, the state is generating enough revenue to pay its workers , its creditors and still have significant left over to cover capital expenditure interventions for solving development issues.\u2019\u2019 said an analyst who would not want to mentioned.\n\nShrinking revenue has in fact, pushed some states to start cutting down on their workforce to be able to survive.\n\nIn May 2021, Kaduna state had cried out that it could not continue to spend over 90% of its FAAC inflows to pay salaries. As a result, the State sacked over 4000 of its workforce.\n\nAddressing a press conference on the issue, Jafaru Sani, Kaduna commissioner of local government, and Bariatu Mohammed, head of service, said the state will not subject public policy to public outcry.\n\nSani and Mohammed said it is not sustainable for the state to continue to spend \u201c84 to 96 percent\u201d of its federation accounts allocation committee (FAAC) receipts on salaries and personnel cost as it has done since October 2020.\n\n\u201cThis government was not elected to devote most public funds to paying government workers and treat that as its defining governance mission, to the detriment of developing the state and its people,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cIn September 2019, the Kaduna state government became the first government at any level in Nigeria to pay the new minimum wage, along with consequential adjustments and it has continued to faithfully respect this obligation. It followed up by swiftly raising the minimum pension to N30,000 monthly for retirees on the old defined benefits scheme.\u2019\u2019\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has reverted to the former minimum wage of N18,000 for its workers.\n\nWhile the state gave recession and pandemic as reasons for the action, no body knows if the state will revert to N30,000 again.\n\nThe DG, Debt Management Office, DMO, Patience Oniha said Nigeria\u2019s debt profile was on the increase because of the impact of revenue crash and the crises trailing the coronavirus pandemic on the economy.\n\nShe regretted that borrowing which was already on the down ward trend in 2015 was rising again adding that the increased borrowing was intended to buoy the economy like other countries.\n\nOniha said, \u201cThe higher level of borrowing from 2015 due to the revenue crash occasioned by crude oil started trending downwards thereafter.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, COVID reversed that trend. That became necessary and many countries including the UK and USA also embarked on new borrowing.\u201d\n\nStates have over the years depended on Federal Allocation to survive given that their Internally generated revenues are small and can hardly do much. On the average, Faac contributes about 80% to the revenues of individual states while IGR contributes 20% and less sometimes except Lagos, Rivers and a few others states which IGR are higher.For instance, Nigeria\u2019s states generated a sum of N1.31 trillion internally in 2020, representing a marginal decline compared to N1.33 trillion recorded in 2019, and an increase compared to N1.17 trillion in 2018.\n\nLooking critically at the IGR per population for the six geo-political zones in Nigeria, South West takes the lead with an average of N13,966, having generated a sum of N561.01 billion and an estimated population of 40.17 million people. The South-South region followed with an average of N8,694 and a total aggregate IGR of N263.17 billion.\n\nOn the reverse, the North-Eastern region, which houses states like Bauchi, Borno, Yobe, etc. recorded the lowest IGR per population of N2,061 closely followed by North West with an average of N2,855.\n\nNevertheless, analysts fear that this trend may not change sooner or later given the precarious condition of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNot many Nigerians are optimistic that the economy of the country has much to offer them given the excruciating pains pervading the environment and general state of affairs. While many believe that the politics of the country is incapable of creating enabling atmosphere to nudge the economy forward, others have listed mis-governance, insecurity, lack of productivity among others for losing hope in the growth trajectory of the economy.\n\nThe challenges are numerous, a former managing director of one of the big banks who would not want to be mentioned in print told Business Hallmark.\n\nDespite the negative impact of Covid-19 which plunged Nigeria into recession in the second quarter of 2020, the economy grew by 0.11 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter; it grew by 0.51 in first quarter 2021 and grew by 5.1 in second quarter 2021 from -6.1 negative in 2020. Yet this does not change the pessimism of many who believe the economic managers and the government are not on the right path.\n\nGoing to deeper grounds, recent statistics reveal that the rate of unemployment, the second highest in the world is 33%. At the same time, the underemployment rate stood at 22%; even as inflation, which is hitting the roof top at 17.33 per cent is at its highest point in the last seven years.\n\nAt this rate, it is difficult to understand the magic the states would perform to turn around their distressed condition. It is a real crisis situation.",

          "text": "The United States Mission on Tuesday, hosted a virtual event to launch the third cohort of the Lagos edition of the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE), a U.S. government initiative that supports women entrepreneurs around the world.\n\nWorking with local partner, Ascend Studios Foundation, founded by Inya Lawal, an alumna of the Fortune-U.S. Department of State Global Women\u2019s Mentoring Partnership program, the U.S. Mission is supporting the training of 250 women entrepreneurs selected from a pool of over 15,700 applicants, representing a cross-section of industries, from fashion and textiles to health and agri-business.\n\nDelivering remarks during the virtual program, U.S. Embassy Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Kathleen FitzGibbon explained that the AWE was designed to empower female entrepreneurs to fulfill their economic potential, creating conditions for increased stability, security, and prosperity for all.\n\nShe expressed the U.S. government\u2019s continuing commitment to supporting women to break barriers, gain economic and financial independence, and create pathways to prosperity.\n\n\u201cWhen women are economically empowered, they re-invest in their families and communities, strengthening the social fabric of society and education and skill levels of the workforce. This multiplier effect spurs economic growth and enhances stability,\u201d Charg\u00e9 FitzGibbon said.\n\nJumoke Olowookere, a 2019 graduate of the program, shared her success story with the new participants. \u201cThe AWE program connected me to the right networks and resources and my dreams grew bigger. Today, as an upcycling entrepreneur, I am the founder of Nigeria\u2019s first waste museum,\u201d she explained.\n\nOver the next three months, participants have access to the DreamBuilder platform, a blended business training course developed through a partnership between Arizona State University\u2019s Thunderbird School of Global Management and global copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan.\n\nIn addition, participants will connect with networks of business leaders, women entrepreneurs and mentors who will facilitate lessons related to business management such as preparing business plans and raising capital.

          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that tackling hate speech and misinformation has become the responsibility of all major stakeholders, especially Parliaments around the world, as the negative consequences of the two can only be imagined.\n\nGbajabiamila said parliaments must find in all regulatory or legislative interventions, a balance between protecting the right to free speech and the right to life, peace and dignity.\n\nAccording to him, proper and legal means should be followed in countering hate speech and misinformation both off and online so as not to tamper with the rights of citizens to free expression.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGbajabiamila spoke on Tuesday on the topic, \u2018Countering Misinformation and Hate Speech On and Offline Requires Stronger Regulations\u2019, at the Fifth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament taking place in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe Speaker said technology and new media had led to the democratisation of public debate in a way that, if appropriately managed, could be to the benefit of citizens and nations worldwide.\n\n\u201cHowever, at the same time, it has created the ideal circumstances for bad actors to spread misinformation, and to manipulate people in ways that threaten our societies,\u201d he added.\n\nGbajabiamila said the right to free speech was not without limits as it did not include the freedom to plant wilful misinformation and that it did not excuse the actions of those who sought to use the freedom of public debate to exacerbate existing fissures in the society, \u201cand it does not include a right to ignite social tensions, through lies and fake news in our societies, without consequence.\n\n\u201cThose who abuse the right of freedom of expression ought to be appropriately held accountable for their actions, especially when they result in evident bad outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe speaker noted that \u201cwhen individuals or entities use misinformation for their own gain but undermine constructive public policy debates, they should and must be held accountable. Indeed, when misinformation results in harm to individuals and institutions, the perpetrators should be identified and held liable.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted that \u201cthis is not to suggest that governments should be in the business of deciding who gets to speak or what amounts to proper speech. However, when it is clear that speech has had negative consequences, it falls to the government to define the criminal and civil processes for accountability.\n\n\u201cTo do otherwise will be an abdication of the role of government in a free society, and that is not only unacceptable but also a dereliction of duty.

          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that tackling hate speech and misinformation has become the responsibility of all major stakeholders, especially Parliaments around the world, as the negative consequences of the two can only be imagined.\n\nGbajabiamila said parliaments must find in all regulatory or legislative interventions, a balance between protecting the right to free speech and the right to life, peace and dignity.\n\nAccording to him, proper and legal means should be followed in countering hate speech and misinformation both off and online so as not to tamper with the rights of citizens to free expression.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGbajabiamila spoke on Tuesday on the topic, \u2018Countering Misinformation and Hate Speech On and Offline Requires Stronger Regulations\u2019, at the Fifth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament taking place in Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe Speaker said technology and new media had led to the democratisation of public debate in a way that, if appropriately managed, could be to the benefit of citizens and nations worldwide.\n\n\u201cHowever, at the same time, it has created the ideal circumstances for bad actors to spread misinformation, and to manipulate people in ways that threaten our societies,\u201d he added.\n\nGbajabiamila said the right to free speech was not without limits as it did not include the freedom to plant wilful misinformation and that it did not excuse the actions of those who sought to use the freedom of public debate to exacerbate existing fissures in the society, \u201cand it does not include a right to ignite social tensions, through lies and fake news in our societies, without consequence.\n\n\u201cThose who abuse the right of freedom of expression ought to be appropriately held accountable for their actions, especially when they result in evident bad outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe speaker noted that \u201cwhen individuals or entities use misinformation for their own gain but undermine constructive public policy debates, they should and must be held accountable. Indeed, when misinformation results in harm to individuals and institutions, the perpetrators should be identified and held liable.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted that \u201cthis is not to suggest that governments should be in the business of deciding who gets to speak or what amounts to proper speech. However, when it is clear that speech has had negative consequences, it falls to the government to define the criminal and civil processes for accountability.\n\n\u201cTo do otherwise will be an abdication of the role of government in a free society, and that is not only unacceptable but also a dereliction of duty. Parliaments must lead from the front in tackling this scourge or we all shall pay a heavy price.\u201d\n\nComing to Nigeria, Gbajabiamila said with the country\u2019s diverse cultures and religions that were still working toward achieving a more perfect union, hate speech off and online could have a devastating real-world effect very quickly.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for us, countering misinformation through proper and legal means is not a theoretical question but a moral and constitutional responsibility.

          "text": "The Coalition for Revolution (CORE) has condemned the Plateau State government for alleged suppression of a peaceful memorial procession led by the youths of the state on Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement issued by its conveners, Baba Aye and Gbenga Komolafe, the group said the young people had set out for a memorial procession in memory of those who lost their lives in the violence that erupted in the state some 20 years ago, and to urge the rebirth of peace and harmony based on justice.\n\nIt noted that drunken policemen, however, dispersed the youth acting on the orders of the Plateau State government.\n\nRecall that on Monday evening, Dan Manjang, the state\u2019s commissioner information issued a statement warning against holding a planned procession.\n\nThe group questioned the rationale of this directive if it should be directed at young people or bandits and other criminal elements.\n\nCORE urged trade unions, civil society organisations, associations and all bodies in Plateau state, Nigeria and across the world to stand against state repression in Plateau state and across the country.\n\nIt advised the various governments in the country to be calm on unarmed demonstrators and go after bandits, whose actions have worsened the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nA statement from the group read, \u201cToday makes it twenty years since unbridled carnage was let loose on Jos. The cycles of violence since then have taken several shapes. This includes and has equally been spurred by state repression.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agents were once again all set to wreck violent havoc on young women and men in Jos this morning. These youth had taken it upon themselves to organize a memorial procession in memory of the dead and to urge the rebirth of peace and harmony based on justice.\n\n\u201cOrganised as the September Seven Movement, they mobilised in their hundreds for a peaceful procession. But the police dispersed them, scattering the wreaths they came to lay for the dead. These policemen were seen drinking alcohol and smoking for hours before the procession was to commence.\n\n\u201cThey were acting on the order of the Plateau state government. The stage had been set with a press statement issued by Mr Dan Manjang, the state\u2019s commissioner information yesterday evening. In it, he warned that \u201csecurity agents have been placed on red alert to rise up to the challenge by arresting anyone who violates this directive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it young people who want to remember the dead that a serious state should be putting security agents on the alert for or bandits who have been having a field day in the same state; killing, maiming, and looting poor people?\n\n\u201cShould the Plateau State government itself not be marking this historical day and filling it with hope for a rebirth of peace and harmonious social life in the state? CORE salutes the gallant youths of Jos and other communities on the Plateau.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau government\u2019s response reflects the traditional pedestrian approach of the ruling class in Nigeria to a life and death issue which is equally reflected in their cynical manipulation of ethnic and religious sentiments. This is what has led to this situation of an endless cycle of violence and bloodletting.\n\n\u201cThe recent upsurge in herders/farming communities\u2019 clashes, nationally has played out in a more gory and horrifying way on the Plateau with many communities suffering permanent displacement from their homes while hundreds of thousands of people are reduced to penury.\n\n\u201dThe youth\u2019s attempt to draw attention to this situation and demand more concerted action by the government to rein in the criminal perpetrators of violence on all sides is the least we should expect. CORE therefore not only expresses unreserved support for the youth agitation but indeed calls on the state government to direct its attention and focus on resolving this festering crisis.\n\n\u201cThus, in the strongest of terms, we condemn the state government\u2019s violation of the youth\u2019s fundamental rights to organise, and freedom of assembly as enshrined in the constitution. We call on trade unions, civil society organizations, associations and all bodies in Plateau state, Nigeria and across the world who stand for peace and justice to raise their voices and stand up against state repression in Plateau state and across the country.\n\n\u201cThis state of siege on the populace must be stopped. A state which finds itself unable to stop reactionary insurgency and bandits but flexes its muscles against unarmed people and disperses peaceful protests is terminally ill. Our struggle for system change must thus be taken up with more vigour, as we, the oppressed masses, fight for our total liberation.\u201d",

Abdullahi Bode and the national secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe briefing was attended by national stakeholders of the group with the theme, \u201cNational Cohesion As a Panacea For Peaceful Coexistence Between Farmers And Herders In Nigeria,\u201d and investiture of HRH Queen Mother, Amina Temitope Ajayi Mama Diaspora, as Miyatti Allah brand ambassador.\n\nAlhassan while speaking on behalf of the organisation, called on the National Assembly and President Muhammad Buhari to intervene and stop current attempt by some states governors to criminalise their means of economic livelihood of cattle rearing through the enactment of satanic and obnoxious laws \u2013 \u2018Anti-open Grazing Laws\u2019 targeted at Fulani Pastoralists.\n\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that inter-state movement of pastoralists is analogous to inter-state commerce, which is an exclusive preserve of the legislative powers of the National Assembly under item 62 of the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. These laws do not take into cognizance the sociology, economic, production system, climate variations and other push factors that are inherent in pastoralists movements across ecological zones.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s mode of agricultural practice is still primitive all over the country are not consistent with global best practices, so why singling out the pastoralists who have been suffering from the cumulative years of neglect in terms of development from both federal and state governments,\u201d they added.\n\nIn similar a vein, the organisation called on the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom to offer an apology to the Fulani race for what it described as tissues of lies, propaganda profiling of the Fulani pastoralist and falsehood against them.\n\n\u201cOur organisation totally condemn the continuous extortion and profiling of the Fulani pastoralists by the Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state and call on him to offer an apology to the Fulani race.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on the National Assembly to resuscitate and pass the Grazing Reserves Commission Bill and other Assembly and livestock management bills that were initiated by the previous National Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur Organisation totally condemn the vituperations of one Emir of Muri in Taraba state for the genocidal propaganda against Fulani Pastoralist and have since taken the necessary legal steps against the misguided local monarch and also written to the Taraba state Governor to immediately dethrone him.\n\n\u201cWe commend the courageous efforts of the federal government under the progressive leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari for listening to our consistent call to restore the existing grazing reserves and routes and create new ones, as it is the only sustainable solution to the farmers /herders conflicts in the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the security issues in Katsina and other north-west states, the organisation condemned the banned of interstate cattle movement in Katsina by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, describing him as a confused and unserious governor.\n\nThe body attributed the security challenge in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states to failure of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Masari is confused and unserious. Most of the herders are from Katsina and the governor should have created ranches for herders to serve as a good example for other state governors to emulate instead of playing to the gallery by ban interstate movement of castles\n\nWhat is happening in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states is the failure of governance because the governments failed to provide education for teeming youths, leading them to the bandit.\u201d",

          "text": "The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has said that contrary to what he described as propaganda by the striking members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), no doctor or health worker in Nigeria is owed their monthly salary.\n\nThe minister said this on Tuesday at the opening of the meeting of the Presidential Committee on Salaries with the leadership of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cfumes from the propaganda machine of NARD were obfuscating the reality of the Federal Government\u2019s efforts to re-position the health sector\u201d.\n\n\u201cNARD goes about telling Nigerians that government is oweing them salaries and that government is not taking the problems in the health sector serious. But this is not true. It is incorrect. No doctor, nurse, pharmacist or any other health worker including the driver is owed monthly salary. Government pays as and when due,\u201d Ngige was quoted as saying in a statement by the Ministry\u2019s Deputy Director Press and Public Relations, Charles Akpan.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that NARD doctors fail to tell Nigerians that their colleagues who are owed salaries are the ones illegally recruited and were therefore neither captured by the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation nor were their payments provided for by the Budget Office of the Federation.\n\n\u201cMonthly salaries are done as and when due for those legitimately employed by the Federal Government but not to those illegally employed and who need their appointments regularized and captured in the finances of government for payment. This takes a process which is not accomplished overnight.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Nnamdi Kanu Sues FG, Others Over Alleged Violation Of His Rights, Demands \u20a65bn\n\nSpeaking further, the minister referred to the presidential waiver for employment into the critical Health and Defence Ministries in view of the general embargo on employment and assured that doctors illegally recruited would have their service regularised in due course.\n\nHe, however, said that the money which the Federal Government owed few doctors and other workers was the 2020 COVID-19 allowance, besides the arrears of the consequential adjustment of the National Minimum Wage and skipping allowance which cut across other sectors.\n\nAccording to him, work was in progress to clear this.\n\nHe blamed the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and JOHESU for bringing segregation in the negotiation for the new hazard allowance which the Federal Government already budgeted the sum of N37.5b for.\n\n\u201cWe started joint negotiation to round off discussion and implement new hazard allowance as early as possible so as to stave off the current wolf-crying by doctors. They brought in segregation and couldn\u2019t agree with JOHESU and both now want separate negotiations. Why then blame the government and make it an issue to strike for.\u201d\n\nIn his speech the Minister of State for Health, Senator Olorunnimbe Mamora, said it was such a wrong time to go on strike, noting that despite financial constraints, government remains committed to payment of salaries of doctors and health workers.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Finance, Budget and Planning, Clement Agba, regretted the expanding budgetary expenditure of government even as revenue continues to dwindle.\n\nHe said government was doing its best and remained committed to workers welfare but certainly won\u2019t continue to borrow to pay salaries.\n\nPresident of JOHESU, Josiah Biobelemonye said his union was \u201cthe patient dog of the health sector\u201d and pressed for the swift tackling of the challenges facing its members, to avoid forcing them to strike.\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, the meeting was still ongoing.",

Two minutes later, an alert Victor Osimhen would pull Nigeria level, stabbing home from close range after the goalkeeper punched following a defensive blunder.\n\nIn the 41st minute, the lively Ejuke again rattled the Cape Verde number one, before Osimhen came close to adding another one from a corner with a minute to recess.\n\nIn the second half, Ahmed Musa latched onto a centre by Osimhen as the Eagles pushed forward, but his tame shot was easily collected. Substitute Onyekuru was also guilty of putting too low a purchase on his shot in the 73rd minute as Nigeria streamed to the opposition area.\n\nTwo minutes later, in a spectacular backpass to his goalkeeper, Kenny Santos scored an own goal as the ball floated above the goaltender and landed in the net. The goal put Nigeria in front and eventually gave the Super Eagles the three points on the night.\n\nVictory took the Eagles to maximum six points from two matches, three points ahead of second \u2013placed Liberia, ahead of the Day 3 and 4 games scheduled for October.",

          "title": "Taliban Form All-male Afghan Government of Old Guard Members",
          "text": "The Taliban on Tuesday announced an all-male interim government for Afghanistan stacked with veterans of their hard-line rule from the 1990s and the 20-year battle against the U.S.-led coalition, a move that seems unlikely to win the international support the new leaders desperately need to avoid an economic meltdown.\n\nAppointed to the key post of interior minister was Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list with a $5 million bounty on his head and is believed to still be holding at least one American hostage. He headed the feared Haqqani network that is blamed for many deadly attacks and kidnappings.\n\nThe announcement came hours after Taliban fired their guns into the air to disperse protesters in the capital of Kabul and arrested several journalists, the second time in less than a week that heavy-handed tactics were used to break up a demonstration.\n\nDrawn mostly from Afghanistan\u2019s dominant Pashtun ethnic group, the Cabinet\u2019s lack of representation from other ethnic groups also seems certain to hobble its support from abroad.\n\nAs much as 80% of Afghanistan\u2019s budget comes from the international community, and a long-running economic crisis has worsened in recent months. Near daily flights from Qatar bring in humanitarian aid, but the needs are massive, and the Taliban can hardly afford isolation.\n\nIn announcing the Cabinet, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid emphasized that the appointments were temporary. He did not say how long they would serve and what would be the catalyst for a change.\n\nSince taking over Afghanistan in mid-August after U.S. troops withdrew, the Taliban have shown no indications they will hold elections.\n\nThe interim prime minister, Mullah Hasan Akhund, also headed the Taliban government in Kabul during the last years of its rule. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who had led talks with the U.S. and signed the deal that led to the withdrawal, will be one of two deputies to Akhund.\n\nA policy statement accompanying the Cabinet announcement sought to allay fears of Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors and the rest of the world, but was unlikely to calm the fears of women, who didn\u2019t get a single post.\n\n\u201cOur message to our neighbors, the region and the world is that Afghanistan\u2019s soil will not be used against the security of any other country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt urged foreign diplomats, embassies, consulates and humanitarian organizations to return to Afghanistan. \u201cTheir presence is the need of our country,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement spoke of protecting the rights of minorities and the underprivileged, and it promised education \u201cto all countrymen within the framework of Sharia.\u201d Women were not mentioned in the three-page statement.\n\nAbdul Salam Hanafi, an ethnic Uzbek, was named as second deputy to Hasan Akhund. A long-time Taliban member, he is unlikely to satisfy demands for inclusivity and minority representation.\n\nBesides Haqqani as head of the police, the other top security post of defense minister went to Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob , the son of Taliban founder and near mythic figure Mullah Mohammad Omar.\n\nThe Haqqani network, which dominates most of eastern Afghanistan, has been blamed for dramatic attacks in Kabul in the past two decades and for orchestrating kidnappings, often of Americans. Washington believes it still holds Mark Frerichs, a civilian contractor, who was abducted in January 2020 and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.\n\nThe new foreign minister will be Amir Khan Muttaqi, another prominent figure from the Taliban\u2019s last time in power. He faces a difficult task, given the Cabinet\u2019s lack of diversity.\n\nThe Cabinet selection defied the many voices that had urged inclusivity and moderation. Instead, it seemed to be a bow to the Taliban\u2019s tens of thousands of fighters, who would have struggled to accept figures from previous governments that they see as corrupt and that they believe they were called upon to oust.\n\n\u201cThe fighters made the sacrifices. \u2026 They are the decision makers, not the politicians,\u201d said analyst and author Fazelminallah Qazizai, who has has written extensively about the Taliban.\n\nYet even with a Cabinet dominated by ethnic Pashtuns, the Taliban\u2019s fighting force would appear to have already attained some diversity, with their ranks bolstered considerably by ethnic Tajiks and Uzbeks. That may have helped hand the Taliban a surprising win in the mostly Tajik province of Badakhshan, which they overran with hardly a fight. When they last ruled, the province was the only one they failed to control.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s demonstration that was broken up by gunfire, protesters had gathered outside the Pakistani Embassy to accuse Islamabad of aiding the Taliban\u2019s assault on northern Panjshir province. The Taliban said Monday they seized the province \u2014 the last one not in their control \u2014 after their lightning advance through Afghanistan last month.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s previous government routinely accused neighboring Pakistan of aiding the Taliban, a charge Islamabad has denied.\n\nDozens of women were among the protesters, and some carried signs bemoaning the killing of their sons by Taliban fighters that they say were aided by Pakistan. One sign read: \u201cI am a mother. When you kill my son, you kill a part of me.\u201d\n\nAt one point, a Taliban fighter responded: \u201cWe have announced amnesty to everyone who has killed our sons.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban moved quickly and harshly to end the protest as demonstrators arrived near the presidential palace. They fired their weapons into the air and arrested several journalists covering the demonstration. At one point, a Taliban member waving a Kalashnikov rifle took a microphone from a journalist and began beating him with it. The journalist was later handcuffed and detained for several hours.\n\n\u201cThis is the third time I have been beaten by the Taliban covering protests,\u201d the journalist told The Associated Press, speaking on condition he not be identified because he feared retaliation. \u201cI won\u2019t go again to cover a demonstration. It\u2019s too difficult for me.\u201d\n\nA journalist from Afghanistan\u2019s popular TOLO News was detained for three hours by the Taliban before being freed. He was given back his equipment and his video of the demonstration was intact.\n\nOn Saturday, Taliban special forces in camouflage fired their weapons into the air to end a protest march in Kabul by women demanding equal rights.",

The violence has scarred the nation\u2019s reputation as one of Africa\u2019s top investment destinations and sent its Eurobonds plummeting.\n\nEffects of the conflict have been compounded by drought, flooding, desert-locust invasions, market disruptions, high food prices, and the Covid-19 pandemic, United Nation agency said.",
